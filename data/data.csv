1,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it. We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
1,"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
1,"A cop stopped me from killing myself last night. A bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. I just feel like I have nothing and no one to live for. I’ve been really struggling lately. The people I count on to come and talk to when I feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so I’ve stopped bothering texting them. The only girl I’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. So I stopped texting her as well. No one bothers checking on me so why should I reach out to them? My aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. And my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. I was seeing a therapist but stopped because I couldn’t afford it. They care more about money than the health of their clients. America summed up in one sentence I guess. 

I dropped out of engineering school in October after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because I just didn’t wanna do it anymore. I was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. I may or may not go back. My student loans are due starting in June which I can’t afford. I have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that I never wanted in the first place with money that I don’t have. I only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which I much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. I just absolutely fucking hate being told what I can and can’t do with my own damn car that I pay for 100% myself. My car is my therapist and my favorite thing that I own. I’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. I cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. It’s been a month since quarantine and I can’t really even leave my house. Can’t have a social life. Just feel like I have no one to turn to and I’m drowning. Every fucking day and I’m just done. 

I left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. I waited til my family had all gone to bed, then I got in my car and just took off. I drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. I eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. I got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone I felt. I was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when I heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. I knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. I just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. He approached with a flashlight and noticed me. Apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. He was a young guy, probably about my age. He asked for my license and registration which I gave him. I’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and I think he picked up on the fact that I seemed a bit off. He asked me how I was doing and what I was doing so far from home at this time of night. It was like 1 am at this point. I just said that I needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually I admitted that I had driven up here to kill myself. 

I thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. He asked why and what was going on in my life. He even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. I had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how I felt like I had no one. He didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. I eventually said I planned to drive my car off this cliff because I was so unhappy. He was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. Apparently he came close to suicide a few times. A quote he said really stuck with me. It was “Sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” And it hit me that that was exactly how I felt. He gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if I needed to talk. We sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. It was so nice to just vent to someone. 

Eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what I just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. He walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. He walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. He followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while I got on the entrance ramp. I drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. I never even got his name or badge number. 

I got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. I snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. I gave no indication to my family that I tried suicide the night before. No one knew that I went out last night. I still haven’t told them and I don’t plan to. They have no idea that I could’ve died. I called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. He texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. I have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. Everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. 

It’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, I don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. His compassion saved my life. It’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. He deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. I owe him my life. Cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. We wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. I don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. I could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. Not a bad idea. Godspeed officer. I’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it."
1,"Who else is just keeping themselves alive for their parents?. I love my parents, which is why I need to make them think I'm happy. I'll make them think that everything in life is going perfectly. Then, when they die, I can finally be done with this world.

Who else feels the same way?"
1,"It doesn't get better. Fuck off with that shit. It drives me up the fucking wall when people say it gets better. I've had ONE single issue be the main cause of my depression my entire life. That's a lack of a social life. 

I'm incredibly lonely. As in I've NEVER had friends in real life. I've tried everything and anything. Fuck off with the ""it gets better!"" 

I can only imagine if my depression WASN'T situational. My situation can theoretically change, as it's an outside factor (even though I know it will never change), but if my depression wasn't situational, hearing that would drive me nuts. It doesn't get better a lot of the time. Sorry for the cold truth. 

I still think life is precious(?) and shouldn't be ended early. Experience it while you can even if it sucks ass. Cause you'll never get another chance. I just live for food and videogames, but there's always something semi-enjoyable out there that you'll never get another chance in eternity to experience. Just wish people would stop with that dumb fucking lie. It's just such a stupid thing to say."
1,its so easy to annoy me now. i hate how bad my depression has gotten.. i just dont want to talk to anyone everything just annoys me and pisses me off i hate this i hate myself i hate everything
1,"Why does disassociation feel so good?. For the first few weeks of lockdown I was almost inconsolable, but now I've found the one thing that helps - completely 'tapping out.' It's utter bliss, like a taster of death without the commitment. Why is disassociation bad for you if it feels so good? It just feels completely freeing."
1,"Doubt anyone will read this. I’m so emotionally tired, of everything. I look back on my life and see a never ending amount of failures. Went through a length unemployment gap and was then employed as an employment consultant. Presumably to churn and burn me. I should be thrilled for even having a job, but honestly I fucking hate it. The kpi’s, the constant up and down rollercoaster of emotions everyday, difficult clients and just being told to shake it off. It’s a horrible industry and I feel like I’m losing myself.

I’m a sensitive person, I’m not ashamed of that. It allows me to read people really well. But honestly, it’s a blight and fucking curse. 

Where do I fit? Obviously fucking no where. Non existence would be blessing, and not waking up even better. Clocks ticking"
1,"Im proud. Okay, so, This is lowkey bragging but im only doing it because im really proud of myself. So, ive struggled with eating disorder after eating disorder and loads of other things, i recently went vegetarian. But anyway, In 2 days it will be exactly a year since the last time i ever purged after binge eating and its been 3 months since the last time i starved myself. Not only that, but its been a month and a week since the last time i cut, 3 months and 5 days since the last time i burned myself and probably the thing im most proud of, Its been one year 4 months and 20 ish days since my last suicide attempt, Im really proud of myself and i have no clue how i've managed this well. I havent had any suicidal thoughts in about 2 months, Obviously i still get really depressed sometimes but ive managed to try and keep myself distracted so i dont do anything stupid. I'm really proud of myself and i literally dont know how i've managed this long, but i know i can make it much further, infact im gonna make sure i make it further. A few months ago i began stockpiling things for a suicide again but a few weeks ago i realised how much better i was getting and threw everything away including my blades, I've had urges but ive not let them get the best of me. I hope everyone else out there who suffers gets okay someday, everyday is a battle but i promise you can make it, i promise."
1,"What have I become?. What am I even doing anymore? Why am I still here? I never belonged here. Some people aren’t meant for life. I tried for a good while, it just was wasn’t enough. I think I’m done. I’m not even in control of myself anymore. If I do this, it will be me taking control. I’ll be making a decision I want to make. The darkness won’t hold me back anymore. Maybe I’ll catch a glimpse of myself before I go. I haven’t seen him in so long. I don’t know what he looks like anymore. I’ve scarred and mutilated my body and my mind. I’m tired of doing this to myself. I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired and I think I’m ready to move on. 

I don’t know what else to do.
I’m so tired
I just want to rest

I’ll just go to sleep and everything will be okay, right?

This is me reaching out I guess. Looking for a reason to keep fighting, to keep going. Give me a reason please. I don’t want to die, I just can’t live like this anymore."
1,"Im so alone. Hey guys, im need someone to talk my life is so bad i dont want anymore..

&#x200B;

if you want to talk with me discord :  drmedwurst275**#2184** 

ENG or DE only if possible.."
1,I've reached my breaking point. I'm done. I can't deal with this anymore everything is just becoming too much to handle. I don't want to be me anymore. I'm sick of constant abuse from my school friends. I'm sick of not being able to be with the people I love. I'm sick of thinking about the people I've lost. In sick of being alone and I am all around sick of being stuck in this world. I'm not supposed to be here.
1,"Home doesn't exist. Just visited my apartment. Haven't been there for a month. My plants are dead. My books fell from the shelve. Everything is dusty and my winter coats are still hanging near the door. I don't want to be here, I don't want to go back, no place feels like home, never did. I'm sick of not being able to belong anywhere."
1,"I have zero motivation what so ever to do anything in my life.... I really wanted to learn photo and video editing, anything to do that makes me feel like im good at sth, i went and downloaded the apps required, and have never even opened them ever since, why? Everytime im like ""no.. im not feeling it"", if i have ever even opened them i close them instantly like seconds after, i really want to exercise, even at home if gym is not possible currently, but i have no motivation at all, i just cannot do it... my brain is just like no, there is no point.

I just go and sit in bed and think about what i could do with my life and whats the point of it.. which makes me even more depressed."
1,"This system is a lie. Honorable grades through my high school, highest average grade at university's first year (out of ~400ppl). Picked absolutely wrong major though, tried another one, didn't work out too. Had absolutely no motivation, but finished first one (from best average grade to one of the worst on last semester), started msc in another field (IT).   Now I'm 24 and feel like I'm years behind my peers. Struggling to find a first professional job, missing deadlines all the time. From the person that usually didnt give a fuck bcs felt like I can do anything if I want, to the person having suicidal thoughts. I'm wrong perfectionist and it kills me and even doesn't let to accept possibility of failure. Everyone's telling you get a good grades, go to good university, have a well paid job and live happy. Well its all nice and actually easy to live up to this standard until you realise that this kind of living is worth shit just before the end of the road. I'm not that smart, more of hard-working type, and as I said, my life tailored me to be perfectionist who can't imagine failure, but I know I ended up pretty bad right now. I don't even know if I want to still pursue my actual field. Missing another recruitment deadline already bcs I'm unable to get going because I'm so tired of all the pressure,  need of catching up and skills improving all the time. I have been always more of artsy and sensitive type, tried alot of that stuff, but always stuck with ""real stuff"" in the end -came from the background of ""only hard work can make you a living"".  Don't go that road ppl. Do what you feel, not what ""people say"". These feelings have been rising in me for the last 4 years, now I'm drained and actually want to leave all of this including this world.

Feel like I've absolutely wasted my like last 10 years on trying to be the best at something (what wasn't that hard to achieve), and realized it was all just for the confidence boost. I'm basically nothing right now. Just sarcastic, bitter person at probably the best years of my life, feeling 10 years older already, and left with no power, nor resource to improve."
1,"It gets better.. I’ve been on this subreddit for a couple months, and here is what I learned:

*It gets better*

When I was diagnosed I started going on this subreddit, putting posts up on my worst days and talking with some of you.

I can say without a doubt that if you are going through the shit right now you won’t believe me. 

You won’t feel like it gets better.

That is the core of why depression is the life sucking cancer it is.

If you told me two months ago that everything would be okay I wouldn’t believe you for shit.

But I’m lucky enough to be able to say it does 
I’m lucky enough to be able to say this here that *it does get better*.

The reason I’m making this post is for those who don’t believe it will get better. No matter how many times I say it you won’t believe me so I’m asking you you please keep swimming, and you will make it.

I have no idea your face or your name but I swear man everyone has fight in them and if you’ve got the courage to reach out on this subreddit then without a doubt you have the fight in you to overcome depression.

I hope your days become less awful until they finally become good ones again.

Keep swimming."
1,A lot of people think depression is just being sad all the time. Its more like the absence of any emotion at all.. At least for me. I can't speak for everyone but I feel no joy. No sadness. Nothing. It really destroys me because I want to feel something but nothing works.
1,"I’m a boring person. I have no interest or hobbies, and I wish I could stop feeling so hopeless and have a clear fucking direction.. I used to always say I had no time to do what I wanted to do because of school. But when virus put school on stop, I didn’t do any of the things I wanted to do. I had an anxiety attack as I there were so many things I wanted to do, but I felt so hopeless, and I didn’t know what to do. I feel like there’s so much I want to express but there’s no activity I don’t feel stressed, or frustrated in. I just want to have a moment where I don’t fuck anything up, because it seems that I haven’t done anything right my entire life. I feel so fucking hopeless all the time."
1,"I know nobody cares but.. I am **SO SICK** of being more emotionally mature than my own mother, especially since 1) I'm not actually all that emotionally mature and 2) I'm stuck living with her. At 29. Because I'm so emotionally immature that I couldn't finish college or get a job that pays enough or keep the job I did have because I'm such a fuck-up.

That is all. Just really needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for letting me vent to you instead of blowing up at her and making things even worse."
1,"I feel pathetic. and that's normal.

I know I'm a loser

i know no one wants to talk to me

i know no one wants to be near me

I know people look down on me

i know I'm worthless.

why is that so hard for everyone else to understand. I am not worthy of kindness or nice things. Strangers understand, but those close to me won't let me shrivel up, i want to give up, and i don't want to exist any more. The world knows I'm a worthless piece if shit why can't you."
1,"Nobody cares about anything anymore.. I am sad. Sad is me. 

Am I the only one that feels like this life in all aspects is turning to complete shit before our eyes? 

Everywhere you look life is shit. And nobody seems to care. I feel like dying. How can I die? 

It’s just gonna get more and more fucked up. I have no hope for anything any more. 

What can I do to be happy? How do happy people do it? I guess they have a life. That must help. Stuff like an SO and friends probably helps keep you sane. I don’t have that.

I am alone and I’ve been alone. Every time I try to not be alone I seem to just make it worse. Nobody calls. Nobody texts. Nobody wants to know me. 

They don’t want to be with a depressed person. Nobody likes depressed people. We should all just die. I should die. The non depressed people would have easier lives without me around trying to sponge their happiness.

How can I die? I wish I knew some easy way. I really want it. I’ve wanted that for years. Decades. But I don’t know what to do. It’s one thing to think but another to actually do.

I know it just gets worse. Constantly. More and more people turn out to be assholes. More tragic awfulness in the world seems destined. Nobody cares about anyone or anything anymore."
1,Only when i’m in the *heat of the moment* upset or angry I think about harming myself. Then immediately after i’m like no you can’t do that. So I think the question I’ve been worrying about is does the occasional thought of self harm mean I have a mental illness? If not what does it mean. Please be kind in the comments. I’m 18 and just really confused.
1,"I'm an asshole, and want to either be alone or just die. I have a wife and 2 small kids, and I regularly on a daily basis want nothing to do with them.

I dont want to play or interact with the kids. I just dont care. I want to care... but my brain doesn't care.

I dont care about my wife anymore. The love I had when marrying her is long gone.

I dont want to do the enormous pile of dish washer loading and unloading 4 times a day because she keeps eating and never cleaning up afterwards.

I dont want to empty and hang up clothes and load the washer twice a day because they keep making a mess.

What I want is to either be totally separated from them and just pay the child support for 18 years, and completely independent and on my own.

I miss the days where I could wake up on a day off whenever the fuck I wanted to. I could game for hours on end and have fun with buddies online.

I used to go out to bars with work buddies or my entire work department and have a great time after a week of work, chat up the ladies, just enjoy life.

I fucking hate being at home. I look forward to work every single day now. I'd rather be there working and away from my family.

But on the flip side.. I feel an insane amount of guilt and anger with myself for feeling like this. It would be a lot easier to just fucking kill myself.

I most of the time rather be dead than do the separation option because Its selfish and awful of any man to do that to someone and still be alive living their life while the ex wife does all the heavy lifting alone knowing that her partner just up and left and didn't give a shit.

At least if I'm dead she can take out her anger on the fact that at least I'm dead and not out there living, which would make her feel worse.

I'm so fucking tired... tired of the hallucinations, the meds that dont work, regularly overdosing my meds trying to get them to work cos I cant see a shrink anymore thanks to covid, waking up feeling like I've been bashed in the face with a hammer every day while my daughter is yanking my arm to get up and do boring shit like play with fucking toys I could not give 2 shits about, watching crappy cartoons on repeat, making her food and then she barely eats any of it so what's the fucking point, all while trying to stand up with a head that feels like it's been blown off.

I'm tired of everyone. I'm tired of my dickhole parents always trying to keep in contact when I've made it clear I dont wanna know them anymore. I'm tired of hearing that the distant family members are sending me messages to say hi when I haven't spoken to them for years since they traumatised me and fucked me over.

I'm tired of trying to get in touch with another friend who regularly thinks of ending his life and trying to calm him down, tired of trying to keep in touch with childhood buddies who just up and abandoned talking to me when I moved.

FUCKING TIRED. I just wanna live like Jimmy in the Wire. Shithole apartment with one room and a mattress on the floor and my smartphone and maybe a TV. Bag of clothes in the corner. Eat when I'm out. Drink lots. Smoke weed or do some drugs. Go to titty bars, and if I cant do that.... fuck it, I'm jumping. Everyone in the world... humanity... go fuck yourself.

Shit species. Always consuming and multiplying and spreading everywhere when theres nothing left to consume. Just like a fucking virus. Fuck humanity."
1,"I don’t want to get better.. I thought this was just me, but I just saw another post with a similar opinion, so I thought I’d share. I don’t want help. I don’t want to cure my depression. I don’t want to get better because I feel like I need my depression. Otherwise, if I enjoy life, I’ll have to live knowing that one day, It’ll end and I’ll have to let go of everything I love. And that is my biggest fear. I sometimes scare myself to the point of breakdowns by just thinking about my own mortality for too long. It scares me more than anything. The fact that one day, I just won’t exist anymore. And I feel that, if I don’t get out of my depression, I won’t have anything worth holding onto at the end and it won’t be as daunting. It’ll be easier to leave and I won’t be so terrified anymore."
1,"Help I keep hallucinating on Zoloft / Sertraline. 

Hallucinations

Hi! I’ve been on Sertraline for almost a year now. On 150mg a day. I’ve been to hundreds of doctors as I keep neglecting my treatment and moving but each dr increases my dose and pushes me out the door.

Recently I’ve been having severe symptoms, I’ve been really strongly visually hallucinating. I’m not talking about like an odd shape I literally imagined the floor crumbling underneath me and was convinced I was going to drop in to hell. I saw stuff like the world look like I was trapped in a game, and lots of dark haunting scary looking people. In the night I kept walking up as I was certain I heard someone walking in the house and kept seeing someone walk in to the room who wasn’t there. I’ve been having severe tremors so sometimes I can’t pick anything up and I wake up in the night soaked in sweat. 

I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? Do you think this could be the tablets?"
1,"Nostalgia is the primary fuel to my depression.. Anyone else? I'm 30 and currently in the worst mental state of my entire life. I've battled depression for 17 years, but nothing akin to this. These past few days are the first time in my life I've seriously considered ending my life. In the past I could always say I had thought about suicide, but it was never an imminent threat to my life. 

Nostalgia seems to be both a catalyst and a symptom of my depression. I can't stop thinking about my old life when i actually felt happiness. Playing outside with my friends, riding bikes, jumping on the trampoline. Just how connected we all were every day, everything felt so real. I can't stop my mind from constantly reminiscing on what my life once was, and the emptiness it is now. 

I never thought I would be someone who would post something like this. I suppose it's the overwhelming hopelessness I feel. I'm afraid of myself for the first time ever, the depression has completely engulfed my being. A healthy way out feels impossible..."
1,"I'm in urgent of a need to find a way to delete my memories.... Please look at my last post for more information. I will not be linking it here.

But basically, I want to delete my memories. Memory loss hypnosis videos don't work on me. Can you find a way so that I can lose my memories permanently? I had enough of them. I WANT THEM GONE!"
1,"Anyone else here literally only alive because of lacking courage or irrational hope?. Believe me, if I had half the courage most of the poster seem to have, things would be so much easier. At the same time, due to this, I’m desperately holding on the idea that things might get getter in the future so that I can justify my extreme cowardice.

Welp, I better start preparing myself for unending disappointment. :/"
1,Contradictory thoughts. I'm sure I'm a worthless stupid piece of shit that doesn't deserve love but sometimes when somebody can't do an easy task to me or sometring like that a rain of narcissict thoughts come to my head saying I'm a more smart or better human being than the rest of the world and it makes me feel confused and hate myself even more.
1,"What a roller coaster it's been. At the age of 14 I became depressed, I was lonely and without friends. At the age of 17 I dropped out of school because I was set on ending my life and didn't see a point in attending school anymore. At the age of 19 I had spent 2 years in complete solitude at home speaking to no one except exchanging a few words with my parents every now and then, I had grown apathetic towards everything. I think this is were I died, at the age of 19, no longer responsive and without a single care in the world, just a hopeless, jobless, education less bum leeching of his parents waiting for death to claim him. I'm now about to turn 21 and I can safely say that I've lost a lot, including the ability to feel shame, the ability to  care for myself, the ability to be happy, the ability to be sad. 

Everything regarding myself is of no value to me, I value insects above myself. All I have left is empathy and sympathy towards others, which is why I cannot kill myself. And so I'm left in limbo, I've got nowhere to go, all I can do is wait and see where fate takes me. I sincerely hope I die."
1,"Bitter and jealous and hateful. No matter where I go I’m too stiff. I’m too fucking serious. I’ve taken drugs, alcohol, nootropics, self-help books, videos, affirmations-everything. I’m still this weird awkward loser. I am a permanent problem. My brain is forever a permanent problem. I need a permanent solution. Please whats the secret-how can you just talk and be normal?!

super angry, so then he gets mad and now i have 2 mad at me, fast forward its 4 now because im starting to get meaner, i calm down and 2 like me again, then BAM one day i made a joke about myself and someone comments a horribly rude comment on it, then it starts this whole thing and now only 2 people like me, my sister and my best friend. how do i stop this. how do i gain their trust again.. Someone help, i feel like starving myself and cutting."
1,"I wish people understood why the , ""Your family will have a terrible life because of you"" argument is not helpful to someone considering suicide.. Obviously a suicidal person doesn't want to hurt people in most cases. Its just that the weight of the nothingness outweighs the pain of others. Its always about someone else, and never about the person with the problem. ""Oh, you're suffering, but too bad, other people need your ass and it doesn't matter how you feel."" I just don't see how people think piling on more guilt and responsibility to someone already struggling is a good idea."
1,"I need some advice (TW: self harm / suicide). So I posted before about having visual hallucinations on Sertraline (please see other post) 

I have since come off Sertraline and started coming on to citalopram. Since my last post I have been extremely tired but also very agitated. Like my mind is ping ponging everything possible and getting things confused on the way. I can’t seem to finish anything I start because I don’t care and my friends have said a lot of things I say don’t make sense or are from an old conversation or I’ve started a new one. I’ve also been experiencing really distressing thoughts of paranoid nature i was convinced my mum broke in to my house and was stalking me and was convinced I was being followed at night. I am also convinced that my next door neighbour is a murderer. I’m feeling more level now and realise that was silly but I’m entering a stage of numbness. I’ve been entering a stage of severe suicide idealation I can’t seem to shake and I’m worried I will act.  

Is this my tablets? Anyone have similar experiences"
1,"Have been struggling with drawing for more than a year, but managed to draw the way I feel now and wanted to share. I've been struggling with my mental state for a while now, and I haven't drawn something good or something at all except for weird doodles in my textbooks for a long time. But just in 3 days I somehow managed to draw these.

I really like the one with blue marker, and I was super surprised to find out that I actually CAN draw something like that (even if that is not anatomically correct or anything)

Anyway, I wanted to share these with your bc I thought people here might understand feelings I've tried to express in those drawings

Thank you for reading this

I wish you all the best and hope you all can find a way to feel and express your feelings

1,"No-one's going to see this, but I can't bury all my mistakes, so who knows?. I don't quite know why this hit me so hard. Two days ago, I was drawing and out of nowhere burst into tears. It was 1:30 in the morning, and it was just me awake. I wasn't listening to sad music, nothing thag could have started it. I just remember rushing to close my sketchbook, turning in to the wall, and sobbing.

The real kicker was today. Turns out, like the idiot I am, I forgot I was taking a course and susbequently had 4 weeks' worth of schoolwork to make up. One of my teachers emailed me about this, of course. I gave a generic stress mixed with technology errors (I wasn't seeing any assignments in that course showing up, which was true), and crawled under the bed to cry. Because I'm that pathetic and cowardly.

I haven't told my parents out of fear that I will lose tech privileges, but it's an overwhelming amount of work and I don't know if I have the will to make it all back up. People say when you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to go but up. I say that they forget where the devil lives. (Watch everyone ignore this post, lmao)"
1,"Can't understand normal people thinking. When I see people suffer, I feel pain too. Even in the very serious pandemic right now, how can some people don't care and  being ignorance to the suffers? How can they keep enjoy life when terrible thing happening from the outside world?"
1,"is narcissism the root of it all. i don't like myself. i don't like the way i have lived my life. i don't like how i've treated others. i feel like i have lived a life of lies. just want to disintegrate. 

I don't like myself as a person and I don't want to make myself better."
1,"Fuck.. Just... Fuck. I can't take this. I am not gonna commit suicide but... Fuck. Fuck me, fuck them... Fuck IT. Fuck the pain, fuck the wheight. The... You know IT. That thing that makes you wonder how you are still alive, how could you survive all this time without killing yourself. Fuck this feeling. Fuck this... Wound, this... Hole, that is in my chest. It seems... Permanent. Immortal. Fuck it. Fuck it."
1,"Can depression cause ego?. I find that over time the more unhappy I started hating people thinking of them as losers and scum. 
 
Is this normal thing or am I just asshole?"
1,"I started self harming again. Well, I never really *stopped* harming myself.

I used to cut my wrists and thighs, but I stopped doing that four or five years ago. Until today.

When I stopped cutting, I did other things. I hit myself, scratched myself, burned myself. I always had to have something. I get these attacks of blind rage where I just have to hurt *something*, but I don’t want to hurt other people, so I usually end up hurting myself. When I do, I feel sort of satisfied with it. I’m not as angry anymore.

I used to have a pretty bad problem with cutting which is why I stopped for so long, but today, other methods of hurting myself just wasn’t working.

I want help. I really do. I don’t want to live out the rest of my life hurting myself and contemplating suicide nearly every day. There are just so many more lows than there are highs for me. But there’s nothing I can do. I clearly can’t help myself. It’s been eight years of genuinely trying to get better, to no avail.

But I can’t get help. either. My insurance doesn’t cover therapy. The only therapist I could see would be the one on my college campus, but with the pandemic and summer coming up, that’s out of the question now.

I’ve really thought about admitting myself to a mental hospital because I am scared that one day, I’ll go too far. I don’t think rationally when I want to hurt myself. There’s one nearby that I’ve looked into, but again, my insurance wouldn’t cover it, and neither I or my family have that kind of money.

I feel hopeless. Angry, scared, and hopeless."
1,What are you supposed to do when you don’t really want anything and don’t have any goals in life?. I feel no passion for anything. My interests have slipped away the longer I’ve been depressed. I used to want to be a doctor. I used to dream about getting married and finding someone to love me for me. I don’t truly want anything. No short term or long term goals. Nothing to motivate me. I wake up to get through the day and get to the end goal- being able to lay in bed and sleep again.
1,"Why do I hate this. I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they aren't physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I'm in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I'm 6'2"", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I'm so fucking depressed.
I told my parents that I haven't been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.
I only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.
I drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I'm actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.

Please if you're not actually depressed don't say you are it's people like that that make me not come forward and people that don't recognize depression as a real condition"
1,"I knew isolation would be bad, but not this bad. I always thought I preferred being alone, but this isolation has me stuck with myself 24/7 and its breeding a whole new level of self hatred and self sabotage. I keep causing fights with my girlfriend, putting off the work I know I have to be doing, and making excuses for being a waste of space. I have no motivation to get anything done. I just want to lay in bed all day and sleep. It's been a while since I've been here, but at the moment dreams or even a dreamless sleep is significantly better than the reality of facing myself and my problems day in and day out."
1,I haven’t ate in 3 days. And honestly I don’t even feel like it. I hate everything about myself and maybe I can finally lose some weight. Being stuck in my room all day is just making my depression worse. I keep getting panic attacks that I can’t control. My life just feels so off idk. I have this emptiness inside that nothing fills. My one friend is gone. I’m alone and I hate it.
1,"[Vent] invalidated and unwilling to open up. my sister has depression but sometimes i feel like she feels she's the only one allowed to feel sad. i haven't ever told her how sad i get sometimes because she usually offers advice like going outside or learn a hobby. i've sought counseling and was referred to a therapist but i haven't told my family because i'm so scared of the reaction. i was even prescribed anti depressants, which i haven't taken because they're so expensive and i'm worried about withdrawals.

the other day i responded to her i don't really have any hobbies and her response was like ""if we felt that way about everything, we wouldn't get anything done.""

any time i reference depression she makes me feel like i don't know what i'm talking about.

thank u for reading, have a nice day y'all"
1,"Weeeeee up you go and down you blow. I told my therapist and my psychiatrist about how suicidal I am and they kinda brushed it off like ""you're not the only one smh"" attitude.

I remembered when I was a kid I would imagine life in 2020 be successful and be making big bucks.
Yea right, getting fcked by corporations that look at us like some numbers on the board, playing Russian roulette, like who's gonna die next and bring in the next unemployed guy named Shawn to replace me
My mind is all over the place rn, I'll be fcked if I take my antipsychotics and I'll be fcked if I don't

1,help me.  I am 19. I have been feeling depressed for long stretches at a time and every once in a while I will feel fine but I go back down seemingly out of nowhere and I am depressed for what feels like forever. I live with my parents and I don't like talking to them about my issues because they just tell me I am complaining. I don't have my own doctor and with this COVID it's not like I can go anywhere to seek help. I feel stuck and I don't want this anymore
1,"if you've ghosted people who you consider friends, how do you react when you see them next?. like no response or explanation to your lack of interest in responding to them when they reach out or check in with you but you've got no energy to reply to them since it's overwhelming or too much

how do you react when you enjoy their company and they seem upset when seeing them after getting over a depressive episode: explain, leave them be, etc.?"
1,"Dead inside and depressed for years... help. A bit of background - I’m a 22 year old male. Growing up I was very sensitive to peoples feelings, the world around me, found everything funny and was all in all a very happy, caring and loved person.

Through high school I smoked weed maybe once or twice every 6 months or so, so not a lot... mostly because I was sensitive to it and had strong reactions. 

Anyway, at 17 some buddies and I camped out overnight. My life has never been the same after that night. I had a soul destroying terrifying experience that truly can’t be explained with words. I can only describe it as an episode in which I experienced the most extreme physical pain, fear, terror, paranoia, anxiety, crazy visuals, blacking out, my sight was MESSED up, losing control of my entire body, and so SO much more for several hours before ‘reality’ started to return I never really spoke about it because my words really don’t do it justice at all. It was literally hell and my brain went through something extreme, I know it.

Things were a bit weird after this but nothing too noticeable. Looking back, this is when my life went from being colourful to slowly fading away. I’m no brain expert but I feel like my brain was so deeply traumatised that it changed into some sort of safety mode, causing me to feel NOTHING and empty, all the time.

My symptoms;
- I feel empty all the time. I can’t remember the last time I felt any emotion, good or bad.
- anhedonia ( I cant remember the last time I really felt pleasure from anything )
- no sex drive what so ever (this wasn’t the case before the accident) 
- erectile dysfunction 
- basically I can’t feel anything, it’s like my brain doesn’t react to anything that happens anymore. I don’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed.
-I can’t cry, I sometimes lie in bed trying so hard to cry but nothing happens.
- I used to have a sense of self, I feel like a walking dead body now with nothing going on inside of me
- constantly fatigued and don’t care about anything 
- loss of imagination and my thoughts are so distant and empty

I’ve tried Zoloft on a 100mg dose for 3 months and felt no change what so ever in me. I’ve tried mirtazapine 30mg for 3 months and nothing happened other than appetite increase.

Please help, I’d love to be the old me again.

Edit : the symptoms list was not exhaustive and this post only really touched the surface, so any questions please ask!"
1,"You’re not my real dad (rant to get my feelings out). I trusted you before you dated my mom. I lost trust when I told my family you made me nervous. I lost trust when you stared at me. I lost trust when you dated my mom.....I lost trust when you assaulted me....I lost trust when you did it again....I lost trust when you did it a 3rd time....I lost trust when you got me taken away. I lost trust when you were still here when I came back. I lost trust when you thought I’d forget. I lost trust when you married my mom. I lost trust when you won in court. I gained trust when I started to forget...I gained trust when I tried to convince myself it was my fault. I gained trust, but only when my mom started asking me to, but whatever you gain, I lose. I wish I knew what it was like to be loved by a man, but not through sexual desire, to have someone walk me down the isle when I’m getting married, someone who was there to help me with the hard homework, someone who would joke around with me, someone who would love me as a daughter.

1,"Just want to be at peace. I want to go somewhere far away. Away from this country. Probably live in the countryside or mountains alone and just read.

I hate being in the city. Everything is loud. Everything is a mess. Being quarantined with my family messes me up more. I'll probably kms before I get to do it. I want to leave.

 I want a peace of mind. My mind is in a haze right now. I could only think of one quick solution to be at peace."
1,"For me, it feels like I'm in a swamp.. So figured I'd type this out on how I felt on this since it sucks. First off, my family has a history with depression. I know my grandmother has it, my father has it, and my grandfather may have had it too. Ever since middle school just year after year I felt worse and worse. Now I'm 23 with one good real life friend (who is my best friend) and one good online friend. Been single for like 7-8 years and just hate it. A long time ago had some of my old friends confide in me about being suicidal (even my best friend) and I tried to help them out the little I could (fortunately they're still with us). Though that's left me with no one I felt like I could turn to.   
Once out of high school I felt like I was in a swamp. Its thick muddy waters that makes it hard to move in. While you got all sorts of dangerous creatures like alligators and snakes watching your every move. On top of the blood sucking mosquitoes and leeches that latch onto to you day after day. At first I'd try my best to move forward you know, try to get somewhere, to get out of the swamp but no matter how hard I tried, how fast I moved, I always wound up back in the same spot of the swamp. I'd see lights and hear voices and I'd go toward them and yell out with my arm reaching for anything, but nothing ever happened and again I was in the same spot. As days went on, my will to move forward, call out, reach out, all faded away. But I'm an insane fool, and every so often I try again, reaching, moving, yelling, only to end up back in my little spot. I get rid of the leeches and swat the mosquitoes and even chase away the snakes but I don't bother with the alligator. Cause I wake up every morning, wishing that I didn't. Every day it feels like I look at that alligator and ask ""Why haven't you eaten me yet?"" and I never get an answer.  
So I'm just standing still, in my little spot. Watching as things go by, and people pass me. Waiting for the day where either someone finally pulls me out or the day that gator finally gets me."
1,"Been reading ""Scar Tissue"" by RHCP singer Anthony Kiedis.. Been binging it today, read for seven hours and will continue. Man I can relate to him. If you like their music, have a history of depression and drug use, I recommend it. It seems like it's been giving me some strength."
1,"Guilty for Feeling Good?. So on Twitter a few days ago, I saw [this article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-making-a-lot-of-people-anxious-and-depressed-but-some-sufferers-actually-feel-better-now). Basically, it talks about how a minority of people with depression/anxiety are actually feeling better in the midst of this pandemic.

The causes of what I'm feeling aren't really talked about in the article, but I mention it for some context.

This pandemic is inflicting widespread suffering and I would give back every moment I've had of happiness so that it'd go away this instant. But like..I'm feeling pretty good? 

I think it's because in times of crisis, humanity tends to come together. I've communicated more with my friends in the past few weeks than I normally do. We've played MarioKart and Animal Crossing online, we've video-called, we're starting up a tabletop game...I haven't been allowed in sink into my depressive habit of isolating myself and then wondering why no one will reach out to me.

It's...really nice. It's given me the motivation to do more chores and get interested in my old hobbies again. I just wish this awful virus didn't have to be (at least part of) the reason why I'm experiencing this. :\\

Anybody else relate??"
1,"It was my birthday today (apologies for bad English). Birthday is the worst day of my life. Every birthday I'm reminded that I don't matter much in anyone's life.
Today was my 19th birthday. Those of my friends who I thought would wish me in the first place, didn't even remember the date. And others who wished knew only because I had told them quite recently.  
Though it's not the first time I have felt extremely alone, even then I feel sad. Maybe it's my fault too, to expect so much of a birthday wish from others. I kept checking my phone after every 2 minutes if anyone had even got a facebook reminder. 

I just don't understand why am I different from others. Other people get wished even weeks before their bday. What would they lose in just remembering a date, 15 April.
Why is it that I don't get the same amount of happiness as others get. I have never even hurt anyone. 
I know this isn't the last time I have felt like a loser. I will get the same feeling sometime later again. 

I just don't want to get reminded the same fact again and again."
1,Hi. Hi I didn’t know where else to go my gf suffers from depression and is going getting help. She’s going to a mental hospital/clinic idk how to call it. I’m happy she’s getting help but it’s hard for me not being able to help her I know there’s no way I can help her or understand but it still hurt. She leaves in a couple days to stay in the hospital for a month and it’s difficult I feel like she feels alone and that I’m mad at her for going I’m not it’s just hard to be separated from her for so long. She’s my best friend and I want her to get help. Is there anything I can do to let her know I support her in her decision to get help even if I’m sad at the same time?
1,"I have not yet met or read about anyone with the same kind of depression I have. Can you please share your experiences if they're similar?. Background: I'm 25. I've had (diagnosed) anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. It was not triggered by anything bad in my life, stress, or negative attitude. It was sudden. It's been theorized by some doctors that it's due to one of the many concussions I've had over my lifetime. I've tried everything from behavioral therapy and therapy sessions to almost every class of antidepressant. Yes, exercising and eating healthy too, etc. I've settled on one medication that's been the best so far. 

&#x200B;

Therapy helped for a while, but I haven't been able to find a replacement therapist that has helped. Therapy only helped me deal with the problems caused by my depression, not my depression itself.

&#x200B;

At my best, I'm a little anxious and somewhat normal, but never completely ""normal"". This is the case for 2 to 4 weeks. I then get a bout of depression that lasts 1 to 2 weeks. It is unprovoked and nothing seems to delay or prevent it, even regular exercise and healthy habits. I cannot stop it. My life is a cycle of several ""okay to good"" weeks followed by a couple of really low weeks. I tried self-medicating with marijuana for a while. It puts a damper on the tough weeks but doesn't help me continue living normally. I stopped using it.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else suffer from a similar type of depression? I cannot tell if it's major, persistent, manic, or atypical, and I frankly don't care that much to label it. I just have never spoken to anyone with a similar pattern. Please let me know if you experience this too."
1,"It feels like the universe hates me. I'm genuinely scared of what's going to happen next because everything has gone so wrong.

First, I live in New York, and my town got infected way before many other places

Next, online school is super difficult for me because of my depression anxiety and add (diagnosed btw). I'm in eighth grade so it shouldn't be that big of a deal even if I failed, but Im taking 3 highschool courses and I might have to retake all of them next year, and I'm fucking freaking out.

I'm also stuck in the house with my parents who will never get off my back.

And to top it all off, my best friend says she doesn't know if she wants to be friends anymore and nothing even feels real.

Sometimes I just like to say that everyone's just pulling a big prank on me and everything is okay. It's really the only thing that would calm me down. I really hope this stuff will make me delusional or insane so I don't have to deal with this anymore."
1,"i could really use something to numb the pain right now. my grandma passed away, my depression and eating disorder just increased significantly, really trying hard to find the will to live. my SO and I aren’t on good terms as of this moment. I am feeling for the people who are struggling at this moment and i feel helpless and hopeless that there isn’t something i could do about it. I numbed everything in me but it’s slowly building up. i wish i had drugs on hand to numb the pain. even for a slight second."
1,Therapy appointment was cancelled today.. I've been using the betterhelp app for the past week and had a session scheduled for today but I couldn't afford to pay for another week so now I can't talk to her.

1,"My depression is my own.. I credit my low self-esteem to all the years of being overworked and made to feel lesser in the military. I joined when I was 17 and I worked so hard to try to show everyone that I was good enough to be a Marine. In the end, I was just another cog that was continuously grounded down until it was time to replace me. All those years of being told that I was worthless have bled into my life post-military. 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the past five years. I've seen several therapists, most of them dismissing my case as a minor case. I've been suicidal only once after I attempted to end it with a gun in my mouth. My vice became alcohol and its wondrous ways of allowing you to forget the pain, even if it's temporary. 

When my son was born, all that changed. My days are brighter now with the newfound purpose of being a dad. I don't drink that often anymore and seeing my son's smile helps me forget my pain better than any bottle ever could. 

But, when he's not there, I still fight to keep my demons at bay. I can hear them clawing in the back of my mind, telling me that everyone's life would be better off with me dead. My life insurance would help my spouse have a home, it'd pay for my son's college, and set my parents and brother up for a long stretch of time. I've thought about it so many times. 

My depression is my own. It defines me when I'm at my weakest. It subsides when I'm at my strongest. It's a battle I'll fight for the rest of my life. One I'll suffer everyday for if it means seeing my son's smile again."
1,"I can’t see the only person who helped me feel better with my depression and anxiety.. I was starting to get better and manage my anxiety and depression but being sent into quarantine ripped away my only comfort. I was working to be able to hold myself up but I was still in the process of needing someone to help. 
I had to move from my college appartement due to the virus with my BF and I haven’t been able to see him in a month and I’m falling back into a hole hard. 

I’ve started considering self harm, again after being clean for months. Every night I’ve been crying. Little things set me off into a spiral of self hatred. I feel so hopeless and alone. 

I feel absolute resentment for his mother. Who will let him go to the store and expose himself to the virus but not come visit me 10 minutes away. 

Talking on the phone doesn’t do anything and I’m so tired of people saying “just talk on the phone, just face time” that makes it WORSE! I need physical touch and smell. Without that it just feels wrong and I’m reminded that I CANT see him. That I had to miss his 21st birthday, that we are going to miss out 3 YEAR anniversary and my 20th birthday. 

I can’t get stuff done. I have so many online lectures building up and assignments and I have no motivation to do them. What’s the point? Who knows if I’ll even make it through quarantine because it likely will just keep getting extended. Suicidal thoughts keep creeping into my head along with feelings of absolute defeat. I can’t stand being at home with my broken family. I just want to stop being in the middle of my parents. I just want peace."
1,"I decided I would kill myself if I reached the age of 35 in the same lonliness.. 32M here with not much to say about my life. 

I never had a date or a girlfriend, at the end of the day that's what crushes me the most, everything I do, I do alone and it's just empty when I have no one to share things with. I can't even imagine what it feels like to be with someone you genuinely like. 

I followed the advice of using the time to do something with myself. We're not born with equal capabilities, I'm fit but I work a basic job and failed at getting an education. I wrote a lot but the end result is still quite garbage. I look at 32 years of life with nothing of value achieved. Neither professionally, nor socially, nor artistically.

And at the end of the road, a lonely life isn't worth living. I don't have much hope for things to change in such a short time, but at least I will now my best years are over and they were not worth it, so I'm not missing out by leaving sooner. 

I just needed to say it somewhere."
1,"I was happy to hear that I have COVID-19. I have asthma and work in healthcare, and everywhere on the media, it says asthmatics are at a greater risk of complications. I was excited because I thought of this being a legitimate way out. I got the virus at work of course, have been feeling awful since the end of last month, and I'm sad to say that I'm past the point of danger. I'm being treated for pneumonia at home, and I hate to say it, but I'm recovering. I really wished that this would be how my life ends, but I'm not that lucky. I wanted to leave with people thinking I fought hard while I had the chance, not looking at it like I failed, how they probably will after I succumb to depression, whenever that may be. 

I'm really sorry to those of you who have family members gravely ill or have passed, I don't wish this on anybody except myself. I hope this post doesn't seem disrespectful."
1,"I hate this apartment. I want out. I want to get away. I want to move so bad. Like today.

I hate living where I live. I miss my car. I miss sleeping in my car.

I want to move so bad. I want to get away from this apartment. 

I just want a new place. I’m on a month to month. I just want a year lease.


Matter of fact, why can’t I get a nice place, under 1.3k? No I take that back, I can easily find a place cheap, but no one will let me get credit pass.


All I want is a year lease on someplace with a nice kitchen, decent backslash, clean carpet maybe two bedrooms. 

Nope, I can’t pass a credit check for my life.

OH and why do people turn their nose at my VA disability? Like yeah I don’t work, and I’ll probably be in the house all day everyday.

But as long as your paid, should that matter?



Nope, sorry we couldn’t approve your application.



LIKE BRO, I was paying 2.3k a MONTH just to sleep in a extended stay for a damn YEAR. Not by choice...2017/2018 ROUGH.


45$ fee every appointment just to write some info on piece of paper and I’m trying to tell these people ahead of time...HEY I have bad credit from when I was young and dumb in the military.  But no, take this fee and deny me.


I hate this apartment, but I was homeless at the time, and they said yes. Honestly they said NO, but the people at the Veterans Center got me in there. Nonetheless it was better than the streets.


Being a social outcast I have no references, err... I mean friends. 

No one to hook me up. 

I remember this one couple that looked at my VA verification letter like it was a fake... I'm like I drove here with disabled veteran plates, my ID says veteran, the freaking paper has a way to contact for proof...


I have apartment hunting trama from the level of pain and rejection I've felt. 


I wanted to run away to Puerto Rico. Well... I thought that would be cool but ya know...lockdown ect, but I don't even know Spanish so...yeah doubt that move.


I'm in abq, and all I want to do is find a NICE place to stay, I'll pay whatever (under 1.5k)
Realistically, idk I'd rather live in a rented uhual then this place... 


Idk, might be some errors and spelling or even format but I dont care... I seriously hate my position in life right now, and could careless if this seems legible or not...

I want to move."
1,"I feel like I’ve wasted my youth being too depressed to do anything with it. And I’m dropping out of school.. I’ve decided today that after 2 years of repeating first year courses, that I need to drop out of school or else I’ll end up wasting more time and money on something that I’m not even interested in. And it makes me feel like I’ve failed myself, and my parents. 

But I think the worst thing is that I’ve realized recently that I’ve wasted the “best” years of my life, if you can call them that. I didn’t do anything in school but play videogames alone, I didn’t network or make friends or build interests or skills. I’m just the same kid as when I went in, but now I’m not a kid anymore so I can’t even use that excuse anymore. 

I’m going to have to start working again too, once I drop out. It’s just going to make it worse. 

I don’t wanna end up being the guy who’s 35 and works a non livable wage. I don’t wanna be the guy who is too boring to make conversation with. I don’t want to be stuck in a place where I’m in too deep to do anything with my life, but I already feel like I’m there. 

I feel lost, I feel sad, and I feel like a giant disappointment."
1,"I just self harmed for the first time in 14 years.. I’m so ashamed of myself but I lost it. I lost my mind. I saw red. And all I could think was fuck everything and fuck everyone. 

My best friend suffered a tragedy beyond words in December. The father of her unborn child and her partner hung himself. She was 8 months pregnant and found him in their brand new house, had to take him down and give him
CPR While he died in her arms. It’s been traumatizing. I have had conversations with her that have been more heartbreaking than most things I’ve heard in life. 

Easter Sunday we’re all having a great morning and my sister brings up that she’d like to give my friend at $250 target gift card to help. My dad out of nowhere says “$250? That’s some bullshit.” Everyone was stunned. no one said anything until I spoke up and said “why is that bullshit? To help my best friend whose struggling really bad right now and is so depressed and sick that she is on short term disability bc she’s not ready to go back to work. Then to save face in front of everyone, he started to lie. Just straight lie and act like he had no idea who jasmine was (he’s met her several times she’s been my friend for over a decade) tried to act like he had no idea about the situation (completely lies. He knew everything about it. He was there when I went to the funeral and asked a bunch of questions and I cancelled a lot of things during this time to support her) and made me look like a crazy person for being upset.

Mind you- my dad and I have had a strained relationship for awhile. My husband and I have been living in my parents basement for a year to try to save and he has made servers really fucked up comments besides this one- called me a fucking asshole bc I questioned something he said Under his breath about me and yelled a berated me in front of my husband. Has been rude to my husband. Made snide remark after snide remark to the point where I’m completely anxious to even do upstairs or be around him bc he’s just mean. 

My mom and I have always been close. She didn’t say anything to him during this incident. And basically said to me after I got upset “shut up. I am trying to enjoy my Easter.” Okay yeah bc I wasn’t trying to enjoy my Easter right ? This morning I made an order at a wine store and she went off on me telling me that I haven’t asked her if she’s wanted anything from any stores when we’ve gone out and basically calling us selfish. Let me be clear- I’m about the least selfish person ever. And I forgot to ask 1 time. We have been out of the house maybe 5-6 times total and I sent her screen shots when I and my husband have asked her if she needed anything. I just couldn’t believe she has the nerve to call me selfish after all this had gone down and I haven’t heard a word from her or my dad about Sunday. No apologies. Nothing. 

So I lost it. Everything came to a head. I am in so much pain and have been for over a decade. I take meds daily. I see my psych and therapist regularly. I try so hard to better myself and be a good person, daughter, sister, wife everything and everyone just seems to want to shit on me. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know what I ever did to deserve this. I feel like I was born by mistake. My sisters never get shit. Literally never. My oldest sister can basically do no wrong- yet I’m supposed to be having a wedding in 5 months and she hasn’t done a damn thing or asked anything about it and she’s supposedly one of my maid of honors. 

I first took 6 of my pills and then cut my arm with my razor. Not too deep and not too near my veins. I am so ashamed of myself. It’s been a really really long time since I’ve done that. The pain I felt. Watching it bleed. It just made me
Want to keep going and brought back all
The trauma I’ve had in my life. All the pain I stuff down every day and have for years. I am in so much pain and still no one cares. I’m just the brunt of everyone’s bullshit. And all I can think about it wanting to end it all. I love my husband so much and my two cats but the pain is so deep that sometimes I don’t even think about how their lives would be effected if I died. And he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand the pain. 

I’ve bandaged my arm. 6 pills were not enough to do anything but make me really tired and numb to my emotions- I did email my doctor. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I just need a hug. I need someone to tell me that I’m not crazy and that I have a right to be upset and feel hurt. My feelings do matter. That my life is important. I tried to text my mom that I wanted to die and she basically got more mad at me and gave me an ultimatum to talk or not and then continued to say I was ridiculous for wanting to die bc she got mad at me about the grocery order. She knows good and well that was just the straw that broke the camels back in my current depression. 

Sorry for the ramble. I just needed to vent. I needed someone out there to here me. Someone to let me know it’ll be okay. 

TLDR: I self harmed for the first time in over 14 years and am ashamed of myself."
1,"i wish i had supportive parents who don't think depression is bullshit.. my mom misunderstands depression on a fundamental level. i don't think she'll ever really understand. it sucks. it makes me feel stuck. there's nothing i can do, nowhere i can go. i'm trapped in this house full of insensitive and ignorant people. it hurts. my mental state is so fucked."
1,"Kept pushing it to the side but today i realized that actually i am a bit depressed. Today i was trying to make some bucks but just when i was about to start doing something i felt sad and discouraged. Imagine how awful it is to be hungry and want to eat, just for your body to run away from getting food and instead go and stay in a corner doing nothing. I cant do this by myself anymore. I need help but no one can give it to me because i am a legit burden and people dont deserve to deal with my shit. Dont talk me out of this, it is not going to work. When you see an abandoned kitten in the street you know you wont do shit if you just pet him. Instead you take him home and help him to flourish. I hate to admit it but i am so hopeless as that and altho i internaly cringe at the idea, i know it is the truth.

I will never be worth anything ever. I am damaged and if i do a recovery of sorts, i will carry the scars of this forever."
1,Depression sinking in.... Hi I’m new to this sub I’m 20 years old and lately I keep having weird dreams that my fiancé is cheating on me I cant help but go through his phone sometimes and I find things I don’t like sometimes I talk to him about it but sometimes I just keep it to myself because I don’t wanna have the conversation I just wanna have happy days with him but now I’m to the point I want to just stop breathing at a times...I love this man more than anyone I do more for him than I have ever done for myself and my heart is aching the past 2 years we have gone through nothing a young couple should have to go through but it has grown us closer and stronger together as a couple I just don’t understand I’m so loyal I’ve Always been that way I’m just so lost and sad and I have no one to talk to someone help...
1,"Had I not chased love, it would be 90% easier to reach my highest potential.. One of my core issues was taking love so seriously as to let it be one of the causes of my depression. Throughout high school, my main problem was trying to find that coveted word, online and in person, failing over and over and over. It was a passion equal to my true passion, fiction writing. 

Over the years, I've come to realize how it's pointless to waste energy on romantic love. Time and time again, I find the energy I put into that is the energy that should be veered toward actual important endeavors. 

Although the desire isn't nearly as strong as it was in high school, I still desire it and I still fear having it taken away from me, which seems to be the case now. What I realize after a post I saw on FB one day is that, I could have and can be working near my highest potential if I'd let that part of me go. Surely, I'd feel less depressed if I stopped putting my worth in that sickening want. It would be a weight lifted off my shoulders. 

So now I'm trying to find a way to staunch that desire entirely or near enough."
1,"Motivation.. 19 in my second year of college, although I've only passed one semester of the four I've taken and had to withdraw from the rest. Went to the doctor after my first year here and they told me I had Severe Seasonal depression. It seemed to only affect me during the winter, but this year it seems like its still hanging on, and I've lost all motivation. I walked out of my job of 2 years, stopped pursuing hobbies I've loved since middle school, and now will be my last semester in college before I have no choice but to drop out (Lost all financial aid and can't afford). I'm currently on 20mg Fluoxetine (10 wasn't enough) and I'm starting to feel completely worthless. The only thing I have going for me is that I still live with my mom, but all i can find happiness in doing is playing video games. Even with the current events and circumstances, I can't make myself get out of bed to work on online homework. I struggle everyday of my life to find motivation to do anything, and I don't know what to do anymore. Starting to feel like nobody needs me here. If you have any advice on what keeps you motivated and what makes you get out of bed everyday, please share. Thanks for reading if you made it to the end."

1,Constantly thinking about dying. I'm always in the constant reminder that how much would it be better if i got into an accident and died. I always fantasize about dying. Honestly i dont even care if i die of the coronavirus bc i dont want to live in this fucking world. I'd be more than happy to die. The only reason i'm alive is because of my family. I know how much it would hurt them when they find out im dead. If only i could erase myself from everyone's memory then i would be able to die without any regrets.
1,"Well I don’t have anyone to talk to so I’ll post on here... (excuse the bad punctuation and grammar). I woke up just 20 minutes ago... it’s 1:49pm... I feel like a jobless fat piece of shit. My lack of motivation caused me to gain 50+ pounds... i get stupidly upset when I find porn on my bfs computer and than after I get done crying I realize how fucking stupid I’m acting and than I get pissed at myself smoke a cigarette and procrastinate when it comes to looking for a job. I know that I’m not helping myself but I just feel like I really don’t give a fuck if I sink in life or not I already want to kill myself . Usually I’m pretty keyed up and emotional but today I feel nothing but anger and nothing at the same time. I’m kinda a hypocrite, I lie and I feel like a bad person.. I feel like if there was a heaven or hell I’d definitely be going to hell at this point I have no one in my life and my boyfriend and his family are the only ones that care about me but they don’t even know he’s my boyfriend lol we’ve kept it a fucking secret for 2 years and honestly idk how to feel about that... my life is a mess and I’m only 18 at this point I survive on weed cigarettes tea diet pills and sleep I really want to die but like all of me and my fellow pussies I’m kinda scared....if you can’t tell I’m balls deep in my depression. I cut almost all my hair off the other day with scissors (short like a pixie) and I feel like I’m really ugly but people tell me I’m very pretty and all it does is piss me off because I feel like I’m disgusting... I’m a sex addict. I’m pretty sure I deal with a lot of shit for someone who is only an 18 year old girl but that would take a novel just to explain. I feel like everything I have to deal with on a daily basis has driven me to insanity I used to be pretty happy but when I turned 16 I was moved from house to house for 2 years and counting. I’m a piece of shit haha and honestly I feel like if I was to lose the weight get a job and have my own apartment I’d feel good again... but right now that seems like fantasy land for me well idk where I was even going with this but yeah that’s me :l"
1,"I've wanted to die every single day since the 7th grade. I'm 24.. Even the real fun days, the feeling always comes back. No one loves me, they say it but its an act. Everyone wakes up in the morning and puts on an act. I can't. I feel I don't have emotions because I don't know how to react to things anymore. (jokes, funerals, birth, parties, hanging  with friends) I have to think about how to react, its not natural. I hate my face. I hate my voice. I hate that when your nice its considered weak. I hate how the world works. I hate the racism, I hate the ignorance. I hate when your closest friends do and say the most hateful things about you behind your back.. or when they think you're not looking. I hate how evil this world is. People are so grimey and so greedy. The bad outweighs the good. It's backwards. My grandma died this year and i'm completely empty and don't know what to do. I don't want to be here anymore."
1,How do u find ur mind?. I swear I just don’t know anymore. Y do I feel like this? So lost so empty. Y me? How come everyone who I look at just seems to be living better then me? I feel stuck between the world with no escape. I want to die but don’t want to kill my self. Please can I go to sleep a never wake up PLEASE I don’t feel like I belong in this world. Everything about screams I shouldn’t be here. How did I get to this? This point of no faith. No matter what I try it just seems as there’s no luck for me. Y should I keep fighting when there no end to this war this pain I’m so tired I just want to sleep. Is that too much to ask for? I hate it here. I hate my self I hate the world I hate how unfair my life has been while I see others who just look as god has touched them. Do I have a purpose? Maybe my purpose is to die maybe that’s the answer maybe it’s all I’ve been looking for. The answer to my peace
1,I've only been working 2 jobs for a couple weeks and it's already crushing my soul. How the fuck can people think doing this is okay or normal? I just finished working a 15-hour day with a total of ONE TEN MINUTE break at my second job. Open to close. I've only been working two jobs at once for a couple weeks now and it's already draining me and making me want to die even more than I already do.
1,"Does anyone else fantasize about dying constantly?. I've never told *anybody* this. I have anxiety disorder and bipolar and people don't know by looking at me. I'm a pretty blonde with curls and a bubbly personality. But I am *so miserable* inside. I've thought about killing myself multiple times a day since childhood. I grew up in the system and had a pretty shitty childhood but it was no where near as bad as some of the people I grew up with. I had a *few friends* whose parents were brutally murdered in front of them. Or I had friends who were brutally raped as a small child. I mean I had shitty things happen to me but nothing really that bad. So I thought I couldn't really feel sorry for myself. I've always been the person that jokes and tries to be positive to make situations better. But fuck me, I am in a low spot. I helped so many of my foster brothers and sisters out and now that I need someone, I keep reaching out (which I never do) and I keep being left on read. I know everyone is going through some shit right now but damn. Honestly I'm off my meds for financial reasons and really feeling it. Why does the government move so damn slow when they owe you money? 

Sorry for the rant, like I said I'm off my meds :(

Also I'm not going to do anything drastic, I have 3 kids and my 2 brothers depending on me and I'm all they have"
1,The only thing that calms me down when I get anxiety is telling myself I can kill myself.. This happens when I think of how miserable the future might be for me. Then I say it’s ok your going to kill yourself if it gets unbearable. Does anyone else do this?
1,"I don't really know if I'm depressed. ***Really long I know. Sorry about that.

I've always been an optimist, all my life I've always tried to look for the bright side of things. And it's the same way now, sometimes I convince myself. But then there is days like these where everything comes crashing down, and I remember how I was bullied by everyone. And how I always felt like shit, I remember all the ""friends"" I used to have that would call me ugly and ignore everything I did, and just laughed at my face. I remember my ex and the abuse I went from her and how no one supported me, ever.

But I don't want to be depressed, I know I sound like an asshole but I think suicide is about the dumbest thing you can ever commit. Why kill yourself when your already gonna die? Why not live life to the fullest and let death come naturally? 

But even though I have those thoughts there is always that other voice in my head. A voice that you can barely hear, you'd have to really listen to be able to hear it. It keeps telling me to kill myself over and over again it says, what's the point in being alive when no one likes you, when all your friends hate you. Your a nobody, stop being alive.

On most days I can barely hear the voice I ignore it, but then there is those days where I wake up and cry and it's like the voice had climbed over the thousands of walls I've put up and its shot the thousands of little guards that I call rational thought. And it's THERE, it's taken over everything.

But I'm still a little strong I can pin that thought down and throw it back to the back of my mind. But it's words still haunt me.

So yeah I don't know if I'm depressed, I don't want to be depressed, I was scared to post on this subreddit because other depressed people scare me. They really do, talks about suicide scare me. Like a real talk on it, the nitty gritty of suicide, cutting, tying a noose all that. It scares me.

Maybe it's because every time I open this subreddit I'm looking at who I really am."
1,"how will i help my bestfriend when we're both hopeless. my bestfriend wants to die now, so am i. she wants to die because of her fucked up father who's always physically and mentally abusing them. i am the only one she talks to about that and i want to help her. but i dont know what to do because im just as hopeless as her. we're both tired of living. but im telling her that taking our lives is not a good choice. but still, i want to help her. but how?"
1,"Feeling really alone and down today. I'm feeling really down today. Very lonely, in fact. I recently went through some heartbreak and it's still lingering. I'm having a hard time letting it go, and letting this person go for that matter. On top of that, there's been a lot of stress at work, which has usually been a place that I've been able to find stability and at least some predictability. 

My feelings of self worth are really low right now. I don't think I'll ever be loved again like this person loved me, and when I have (sporadic) communication with this person it feels so cold and distant. 

I hate myself for not being able to let go - for still caring so much about this person and not being able to undo that. 

I hate myself for not being able to get out of this rut. 

I've seen a psychiatrist and I'm not showing enough of the symptoms to go on medication but I definitely have some elements of depressive disorder. 

A lot if it is because my life really feels like it's in the shitter right now and no one cares."
1,"I feel like I have the memory, of another persons life. My life has changed dramatically over the past two years, im 16 now. It May not Seem like a lot, but my life was completly different 3 years ago. I was happy, good selv esteem, had a lot of bestfriends, loved going to school. I was a completly different person. Now im severe depressed, not going to School for a year, not socialsing at all. Im trapped in this spiral, im dealing with metamagical thinking and existential thoughts. Im just hoping for some new technology and treatment. And im also currently writing about depression, like the biology of depression.

1,"I can't even figure out how to get government benefits, this sucks. I think I messed up my taxes or something. I'm only getting $66/week in unemployment, that extra $600 a week isn't showing up even though it's supposed to be for everyone on unemployment. And everyone has been getting that $1200 stimulus check, meanwhile it's saying there's nothing available for my account.

I worked part time for minimum wage, and I can't even figure out how to get benefits. That's how pathetic I am.

If that money doesn't come through by next week, I'm gonna hang myself"
1,"""You're too funny"" I wasn't trying to be funny. I am no longer close with this friend even though we live in the same city. I've gotten together with her twice last year just to reconnect.  I know she leads a busy life with her husband and kids but during this pandemic they are all home. 

I'm going to a farm an hour away to pick up maple syrup which it is cheaper to buy in a large quantity as opposed to buying a small jar in the grocery store.

I sent her and another friend a text that if they would like to buy also  I'll drop off the jug at their doorstep. My one friend declined since her mother had purchased some for her already and thanked me for thinking of her. But the other friends' response was ""Lol, your too funny. We are all good for Maple Syrup, we have lots"".

I am taken aback by her response. Am I reading into this too much?"
1,"Putting a pillow over your face when you cry is a top tier way of crying. Basically the title. I've been crying more than usual recently and honestly just lying on your back with a pillow on your face is so good.

I dunno if it's the wet fabric or the knowledge that if any pressure was applied it would smother me to death but it's so much better than crying regularly."
1,"I’m new to depression, looking for some advice I guess. Hi guys, I’m 16 years of age nearly 17 , I’ve had a great life, nothing to be sad about but over the last week or two I have been showing all the signs of depression; breaking down over the smallest things, no motivation to do anything, tired all the time and just that general emptiness, I have been smoking weed for a a year or 2 now and everyday for the past few months, I’m not sure if this is why I’m depressed or what but I just wanted to ask a few questions, 
1) would quitting cannabis be a good idea? And why?

1,How’s quarantine treating everyone. For me it’s a mess the only thing that used to bring me happiness were my friends which I am great full for. But everyone says stay in touch but dose any one actually no how hard that is. The foundation of my happiness is gone I can only hope that this virus ends soon.
1,Im tired of arguing. Im tired of dissagreements. I just want peace. I fucking hate drama. Why can’t people just agree with something for once?
1,"Hi all. 
I am 20 years old male
I came across a health issue 6 months ago and how I dealt with it is.. eye opening.

I had some stomach issues stem up. There was a thought in my mind that I had bowel cancer because I had all the symptoms, blood in stool, constipation, you name it. The night before my blood tests and a stool test that looks for blood, I cried thinking about it. What was I thinking about? I was imagining that the doctor says they found what I was fearing. Then I started thinking what I would tell my family. Would I lie? Say that I love them all and they have been all I ever wanted and more? 

Or would I tell the truth? Would I tell them how I truly felt about them? Maybe so they could change? Would I tell them that I don’t mind if something in my bowels is gonna kill me?

I mean, I am not going to lie, when I had that fear from built up anxiety, I actually wanted to live. I really did. But here I am months later, back to my normal life. Why did these feelings go? Why can’t I get this feeling when I am healthy? Why am I suicidal now, but when I was close to “death” I wanted to live so badly?

Mind you, this is not the first night that I felt this way. I’ve had uncountable nights and days that I had this feeling. In fact, 6 years ago when I was 13 I dreamed that I blew my h*** off with a shotg** in the balcony. Then I turned into a ghost and went inside my house, telling my family how Sorry I am but nobody replies or sees me. I woke up crying. Since that dream I promised myself I would never do such a thing. My thoughts might say that theyre better off without me, but I know, from that dream, that if I go that way I won’t make anything better. 


I just don’t get why I came into existence. I want to die. Why can’t I just die? What do I do?"
1,"I am done with always feeling like the most worthless thing that exists. I hate myself more than anything in this messed up world , but I am done waiting for some miracle or sudden change. It isn't going to happen by itself.

I have extreme depression , anxiety , suicidal thoughts 24/7 and I know one day I am going to end my own life . But I want to have some fun before it. 

I want to get high , drunk with friends , go to a club , have sex , travel and have a real fancy meal in a fine restaurant. My life goals aren't complex , but those memories will be everything I will have while looking back at my shitty ""life"".

I just hope this terrible times with corona will pass as soon as possible , so I can get out of my home prison and try to feel alive and not dead and hollow inside.

Fuck school and terrible  abusive parents who don't understand grades aren't important if just not committing suicide or self-harming takes the majority of your energy and focus.

If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or you think you might be starting to develop depression , please go see a professional before it's too late like for me."
1,"Is there someone in this world waiting for me...?. I just need someone in my life to hug me thight so i feel comfortable... never had someone ever and i promise that i'll treat her like a queen.. please god... let her come and save me from my depression and loneliness... i want to love someone... i want to be loved... i want to be valuable to someone... i want someone to understand me how i feel and accept how i am... If one day i meet that person, my life could change forever..."
1,"Boyfriend seems to go through depressive weeks, any tips for how to help him cope?. As the title says, my boyfriend goes through periods of depression. He'll be fine one week and the next his brain will be telling him it'd be easier if he weren't around.

Obviously I absolutely hate seeing him go through this, and I try to do simple things like make him great meals and pick movies to watch I think he'll love etc--but I don't really know how to best support him. I know I can't fix things for him but I'd love to ease them a little even.

Any suggestions?"
1,"religion, and why i get offended by a lot of christians.. well this hurts me a lot. i've recently been told

""if you aren't christian, you deserve all hatred in the world.""

wow. just wow. please don't come attacking me because I don't believe in your religion. if you actually appreciated your religion, you wouldn't be mean to people you don't even know. :') 

i know we say stuff like this all the time, but this just really hurts man. when people just say ""if you don't believe in this you're stupid and deserve this and that"" 

just shut up. 

thanks for reading this

no hate please xx"
1,Life is confusing. I literally have no idea why I still exist.  There are people who actually enjoy living and are happy and have so much going for them.  I don’t contribute anything valuable to the world.  All I do is take up space.  Thank goodness I will be dead later this year.  That brings me a sense of peace.
1,Is anyone willing to hear me rant?. My fathers wife died. When I met her and my father a few years ago I could tell she was the one who was really trying to make up for lost time. Shes been there for me and I genuinely loved her. No one told me about her passing. I only saw a snapchat post from my sister. I feel like I'm about to break. There's the grief from her passing mixed with all of my issues with rejection combined into one nice emotional break down.
1,"another person with daddy issues. its me again. ive watched a movie with my sister, imaginaerum, and honestly i got deep in thought

for those who didnt watch, relationship of main character gem with her father is the key point of the movie. shes salty, shes pissed, she hates him most of the time but ends up forgiving him before he passes away.

and all that got me thinking of how much my life is ruined now and beyond fixing because my father was doing what he wanted all the time. usually it was drinking and trying to hit the jackpot. he spend all his life being given things, so he wanted to be rich easly too. except... then he would waste it all to get drunk. and its been always like that, aside from threats about killing my mom flying around the house, broken plant pots, plates and other stuff. he chilled now but im still here stuck with him.

and i cant even think of what i lost because of him. my childhood, my possible friendships, my possible romance, my holidays and vacations, my education, three years wasting away at home and then another three of wasting away and *sometimes* going to shit job that i hate with horrible pay. and all this is still continuing and i cant start living because lol... for what money

i cant even have good paying job because im hs dropout. i dont have driving license either. i started the course to get it two years ago but i didnt pass two exams and quit trying... thats pretty telling about me

i just. need someone to help me pull it together because i cant do it on my own. and i got no one. i just cant do this anymore i hate him so much he destroyed everything for me, even my own brain. otherwise i wouldnt have this awful depression with szpd. i just cant anymore"
1,"Don’t wanna wake up. I just go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up in the morning every night. I have no friends, no one cares about me or what I want, I’m one if the unluckiest people in the world, my family DOES NOT care about me even though some people may say differently well they don’t they never have and never will. Fuck it if no one cares about me then why should I."
1,"I feel like I'm out of options.. I've never posted here but I can't see my friends and reaching out to any of them is just going to make me feel like a burden.
My professors will put in emails ""hows working from home"" or ""how are you doing"" and i know that i have to falsify and answer because they don't care. 

The week i finally decided to apply for Medicaid (my health insurance doesn't cover therepy)  and get in the process of maybe getting help i got kicked off my campus because of coronavirus, and in person sessions are out of the question in any capacity. This was in mid march. 

Now I'm at home. I live with my sister and parents and my sister at least can acknowledge I'm suffering but i feel like my parents can't even fathom what I'm going through and i hate them for that. They talk about how terrible this quarantine is when they both work from home and have an easy time waking up every day. I wake up and have to fight myself to even leave my bed. I know they view this as laziness.

I feel anxiety even leaving my room now because i don't feel equipped to deal with whats outside my door. 
I get halfway through making meals sometimes and just stop because its not worth it. If i burn something it usually means I'm not eating because i don't have the will to remake it.

I get angry with deadlines a lot and hurt myself sometimes. I never really mean to it just kind of happens. I'll be working on something that just isn't coming together and i feel like i need to take it out on something and I'm usually the most deserving thing in the room. I haven't cut myself in years but now i just bruise or let myself go hungry.

I just have so much fucking damage and I don't know where to start putting it. I've been shoving it under the rug for so long im pressed up against the ceiling. Sometimes depression doesn't feel like something i have it feels like something i do. I feel like i choose being depressed over feeding myself, or doing my homework, or interacting with others.

I feel like my life isnt just on hold but regressing, I feel like all the trauma I've gotten from others and damage I've given myself has no value. All i can think about is how much time I've obliterated feeling bad, and how I'm never getting it back, and how I'm never going to stop adding to it.

I guess the last option is just acceptance that this is my life and hoping the clock runs out as quickly and painlessly as possible."
1,"i don’t feel like doing anything anymore. like the title says i don’t have desire to do stuff anymore. anytime i think about doing something i almost always seem to resort to “i really don’t have the energy for this”. 
it’s like in general the effort needed to do ANYTHING vastly outweighs the reward. i go to work, because you need to for income, but that’s about it. i think due to depression my brains reward system is not working correctly, this could be symptoms of anhedonia."
1,"Medication and Parents. I [20F] have been wanting to take meds because I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd for 6 years now. I have been on and off meds and in and out of hospitals at the start. I haven’t taken meds in about a year because I still live with my mother and she does not like me taking them. It actually weakens our relationship because of how angry she gets when I have them prescribed. She tells me, “You’ve been doing so well, why the f**k do you need drugs?!” and acts like i’m some monster. The problem is, I rely on my parents to pay for my doctors visits because I only make enough money to pay my bills, and get gas to commute to school (far). Has anyone else been through this? I feel pathetic because I am 20 years old and my mom acts like i’m doing a war crime by trying to better myself. I’ve tried yoga, exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc. Nothing holistic works when you genuinely have a chemical imbalance, what else am I supposed to do? I guess I am just here to find some support or people who can relate.

TL;DR: My mom thinks I’m insane for taking meds for my depression/anxiety/ptsd even though i’m 20 years old and have been going through this for 6 years. It weakens our relationship when she finds out that i am taking them."
1,"Can someone be proud of me?. Please?

I don't have anyone to tell so I guess you guys are all I've got, to be honest I prefer it that way.

Today I got up before noon, got dressed and actually brushed my teeth (something I've had trouble with) and opened my curtains.

My agoraphobia has always stopped me leaving the house but now quarantine is doing it for me. But I'm happy I did something.

I'm still lacking motivation to shower, self care has always been difficult and I'm still debating whether I should eat. Kind of disappointed. 

I'm happy for myself.

I hope you are doing well, too. Stay inside :)

Edit: grammar mistakes"
1,I feel i can't take it anymore. Everyday one of my thoughts say mm what if you just kill yourself but then I think in my mom and the pain I cause her and that stops me but i hate this life I'm not happy I hate my life
1,i am so angry at myself because i am literal trash. i hate who i am. i hate my mind. i hate that i am insecure. i hate that i am socially anxious. i hate that i am depressed. all of these things make people not want to be around me. i try to be nice but people always leave when i need support. i hate myself. i want to hurt myself but not by cutting - i wish i could physically beat myself up. i have no one and if i died no one would miss me.
1,"TW! (mentions of weight). My friend is born perfect. She’s so skinny and just so pretty. She has a fast metabolism, she’s short, she’s under 100 pounds, she has a big thigh gap, she’s like a twig and i want it. i want to be her so bad."
1,"I am the undesired, the unwanted, the unloved. And I am miserable.. I am the shadow you never see, the gutter trash you ignore, the rain that forces you to cancel plans, the wind that carries all you love away with it. I am hated, misunderstood, abused, ostracized, discarded, the punching bag.


I’m the bad guy.


But I am none of that by choice, I am those things because my peers decided it for me."
1,"Not depressed,but i don't belong here.. I'm just a selfish person,i don't care about anyone else except for me. As far as i am concerned,everyone should die. This might sound edgy but i just feel like it. I'm really happy with my life,probably happier than 99,9% of people today. I just don't feel like i belong here. I do lots of philosophy in my head about things that bother me like what is right and wrong,why do we live... It just doesn't seem right,but who am i to say that,i can't even distinguish right from wrong because i don't believe in things like that. I just sometimes feel like i want to fucking kill myself. Lots of people would be hurt by it but i don't really care. Only thing that is stopping me is that i have a life goal. My life goal is childish to some people,to some it seems determined but it's my fucking thing,i don't care what they say. My life goal is to have a good gaming setup and just play games and watch anime. But there is this thing,school in the future work... There is so much more to life than just going to 8 hours a day at work/school,and sleeping 8 hours a day. I don't want to go to school,lemme just do my fucking thing. i was born to enjoy,not to go to school like a fucking retard tied to system. After i accomplish my goal,i'm almost 16,so it's gonna be soon,i'll kill myself. Life without goals is as good as dead. I don't really care about having a wife and a family and all that normal shit. In few years i'll probably kill myself. I don't ask for any help because i don't need it. Not afraid of death or anything,but being alive in a world where i'm tied to a system just isn't for me. I just wanted to throw this out here,huge thanks to people who read it until the end."
1,"Peaked a year ago, still picking up the pieces.. TL;DR: (Life was perfect a year ago, everything went to shit. Don’t know how to be more disciplined / productive and don’t know where the boundary of ADHD / Depression ends and when me being undisciplined starts)

Hi. So two years ago I basically was on the top of my game. I was doing really well in school (then a junior in high school), got the job of a lifetime, and had awesome productivity / work life balance. This was also my first year in school being diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive, Anxiety, and Depression. (diagnosed end of sophomore year)

Everything fell apart. I lost the job, my dad went to hospital, I accumulated debt by borrowing money from friends while sustaining myself while my dad was in the hospital, grades died, etc.

My dad is now fine, and I’m recovering in most aspects in a stable way except my productivity and discipline. 

(BIG NOTE: My medication has never really been a good thing. I used to be on meds but I haven’t taken meds regularly in a long time. My meds make my heart rate go crazy and generally worsen every aspect of both my ADHD and Anxiety and essentially only works after the meds wear off and I’m on the come down.)

I have so many aspirations. I want to continue doing design. I want to pursue music too. I want to do well in school. I want to continue to watch a ton of YouTube and anime and such and be cultured and on top of what’s going on in the world right now. Yet this is an example of how my days have been going.

10 AM: I wake up. 
1 PM: I work out
10 PM: I finish some assignments that are dude before midnight
12 AM: PS4 / Anime
3 AM: Bed

I don’t know where the time goes. I don’t really enjoy my time, nor am I productive. My friends give me advice which I read and agree that it’s logical but yet i still find myself at the end of the day asking what did I just do.

😔"
1,"I don't know what to do anymore(rant). I had depression since 14 and it was getting progressively worse and worse until I had a breakdown and got kicked out of school. I did go to the doctor but she just stuffed me full of pills and nothing else and therapist my parents found is spiritual so I stopped going to her. My psychiatrist just tells to go outside. She never told me what exactly I have I just assumed from my symptoms. Bipolar depression and social anxiety, can't leave the house because of panic attacks even with medication and can't handle stress at all, I'll just have panic attacks and another breakdown. I tried to apply for welfare coming to conclusion I'll never be able to work and at least try to focus on my hobbies that I somewhat enjoy and get some little money from them and the welfare. But I got rejected saying ""I see nothing requiring a welfare here"" as the worker looked at the report from my psychiatrist. I managed to get a sick note from my main doctor but that will end soon and I'll have to go look for a job or make my parents pay for my insurance and I already think I'm a parasite for just living with them and wanting money on things from time to time. I just don't know what to do anymore and would rather die than to put my parents into debt, especially now that so many people lost their jobs. I've gotten bit better after not having to worry about stuff but am sure I'd just have more breakdowns if I had to go somewhere daily or have deadlines. But I suppose I'm just a lazy piece of shit that should just shut up, stop complaining, man up and get a job."
1,"Idk anymore. I was doing good staying in, I felt it was a mental restart but now I realize Idk
What’s going on with my job, relationship, life in general I just hope to find my way out this slump"
1,"What’s the point?. What is the point of living if I hate every second of it? I feel like a disappointment, I’ve done nothing with my life. I have no one and nothing to live for. I want to see the joy in things but at the end of the day I’m always alone. So again, what’s the fucking point?"
1,"I just don't know what to do, I'm tired. So I would like to mark that English is not my first language. Thank you for understanding if you spot any grammar or other mistakes like that. Trigger warning: bullying, toxic relationship.

\----------------------

I just don't want to live. No one understands that, everyone keeps telling me shit that my life is just about to start. Like saying that my problems maybe doesn't matter because I'm young (18). I'm scared that life may be even worse than today. I've been suffering from depression for a really long time (I stopped being happy when I was 4th grade, wanted to kill myself since 6th grade). Everyone in my primary school was bullying me and telling me stuff I'm ugly, weird and sometimes they were throwing stuff at me. There was once a boy that kept kicking my legs but I don't remember exactly why. When I graduated from this school to another, the bullying just didn't stop. They were bullying me because I was poor and my family had financial problems. When I moved to another town I had strong trust issues but everything was fine. I felt like everything is about to change to better.

But it didn't.

I found my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were with each other for almost 2 years. I felt loved and I would do then everything for him just to feel loved. I was very jealous of him. Something like yandere tbh but I don't think so, I just wanted to be with him forever and show everyone that I can be in relationship (I remember when one of girls from my class in primary school told me that I'm so ugly and disgusting that even a pedophile wouldn't touch me). So I did. Until he started insulting me in a very vulgar way but mostly he called me ""a fucking ameba"". He also started to be nice to me but only when we had sex. I couldn't satisfy him when I tried to pleasure him. He was also trying to flirt with my lesbian acquaintance. In front of me. Many times. I didn't want to end this relationship because I thought that I will never find a partner again and I will be forever alone. But I finally decided after all this long time of pain. I told him to fuck off. I cried for a long time but for now I just feel disgusting that a person like him has touched my body. No worries, he never raped me nor molested me. I just feel bad that someone like him touched me.

After some months I went to the mental hospital because I was feeling really suicidal. I've been here for about 3 weeks. People were bullying me there because I was annoying to them and one girl even told me that I should just kill myself and everyone will be happy. They were laughing at me because ""I couldn't handle the truth"". My mom took me out from there even though my doc wanted to keep me for two weeks more. Yes, she knew what was happening to me during my stay in this stupid hospital.

When I was there someone from my classmate's discord told me they can keep me company during this hard time. It was my future boyfriend. We were with each other for some months. He broke up with me because he felt that he has feels for a girl that he knew for a long time. I felt sad but he never hurt me, so I decided just to let him go. I didn't want to be annoying or something.

And now we're here. Me, depressed and bored, who doesn't want to get better because I know it won't work. It never worked. And this coronavirus stuff is making me even more depressed. I wanna die but something from this virus just bugs me. I'm just... lost, ugh. Everything pisses me off."

1,"Am I depressed/suicidal?. I don't want to kill myself but I also really don't want to live my life. A little bit about my thought process. 

I've had mixed feelings on this label. I'm the kind of person who won't test for something so that it doesn't exist. Like dyslexia, I was offered a test in Uni and didn't take it because the answer is no I don't have dyslexia until proven otherwise.

I have this same mentality with depression. I also wouldn't even know where to start. people say go see a gp but I've never had one and I'm not in a position to see one without my family asking questions. 

I'm also not into self-diagnosis and would never say I have depression. I may be depressed or feeling down from time to time but I just don't know.

I've always been self-aware and existential (if that's even a word). I've always thought why this life. Why am I in this body. Why do I have these feelings, these emotions and these motivations or lack of movitation. I feel like there should be a grand scheme to things but I can't dedicate myself to one with no evidence. I'd love to believe in reincarnation but what's the point if you cant remember a past life. Id love to believe in afterlife but like does that mean for 80+years you get on earth you get an eternity of just watching sounds tedious. I'd love to believe in heaven but then does that mean there is a hell.

Anyway down to the main point. I'm going to try and put this into words but I don't even know what to call it. I am not suicidal, I don't want to kill myself but at the same time I don't want to carry on living. 1. I don't think I would kill myself 2. Even though I'm meh on my family I wouldn't put them through that 3. If a truck ran me over next week my instant thought would not be ""no i have so much to live for""

I feel like I'm done with life. I don't want to carry on. I don't want to make decisions that could backfire. I don't want to make a wrong move and regret my past (although I hardly regret things). I don't want to try and get out of my funk and become social again. I've always struggled with friends, my relationships and my passions. My whole life is made up of; I want to do this  I pursue it, get so far and then for whatever reason its done - over with. I don't want to keep doing that.

Life is too much of a gamble and I just don't want to risk it. It's like a game and I'm done playing but I can't bring myself to quit. I don't enjoy playing I'd rather I naturally land on a square and go bankrupt and lose the game (monopoly). It's like I don't want to see what positives are out there I'm not ready to risk the negatives and the positives aren't enticing anymore I'd just rather not play at all. Even if someone said here's a free pass I'd rather just not do it.

There's too much unknowns in life and out of it. Does what I do with my life effect my afterlife if there even is one and ultimately do I care.

I really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this being so long I just felt like I need to put it into words and see if anyone has experienced similar things."
1,"How to stop defaulting to lifes challenges with suicidal thoughts?. I am getting worse.  It's like everything leads me more and more to thinking about how the pain is personal, permeant and pervasive.  I cannot see light at the end of the tunnel.  The more I go there the more worse it gets.

(Note to self identify triggers)"
1,"Been a long time since I was back here. It feels like I've been lying to myself. You know, one second you're sitting at home, happy for your college getting suspended for the longest time, and the next second you're empty for no reason. I've had the dark, depressing corners of my brain take hold of me many times in these past few months, but this is...worse. It's been long since I felt truly alone and hollow after being surrounded with absolutely everything I want. It's weird, I feel like my mind is retching and howling and all I have to show for it is an unenthusiastic face and drooping eyes. Got a laugh out of me. Still amuses me. I feel the eyes of my parents on me. They're the sweetest, and yet I can't help but think they're disgusted by me. They're not, I know they're not, and yet the only thing I felt today was a strong urge to apologise for existing.

Well, fucked here or fucked there. At least I'm at home without work to do. I thought things would get better if I was in a better place during the quarantine... Eh. Bring it on, world."
1,"A poem about insomnia and depression. It’s 3 in the morning once again.
I’m up and overthinking like I always do.
My patience with myself is running thin.
I hope that I don’t completely destroy you.
I’m no angel I love to sin.
The devil has something in me he’s beginning to brew.
You won’t see it coming till only then.
It will leave you cold, alone and blue.

It’s 3 in the morning another night.
I wonder where these evil dreams come from.
My angels and sleep paralysis are putting up a fight.
You sill stay with me even though you are completely succumb.
The room goes dark but my head turns on a light.
My whole body goes numb from the tip of my tongue.
All of me is screaming as I lose my sight.
I’m tied down to this bed but I need to run."
1,"Leaving. So if I kill myself then it's the worst thing ever to my family, but I'm thinking of just packing my essentials leaving my phone a driving as far as my truck goes on a tank of gas then walking. No idea where I'd walk to maybe somewhere else but I think I've hit the point where I just can't take other people telling me how I should feel and how I should live my life.
I've had depression for around 20 years now and it's just awful. I understand those who say it'll get better but when it does it's simply when is it going to go downhill again? I've been on the back and forth for years had 2 vehicles totally paid off had 2 jobs that I loved to work at, had the whole thing. But even having financial security, food, shelter, drugs, friends/family. None of it has ever made me happy.
We live in a society that says we need things, people, drugs, or a certain outlook to have a happy life.
I don't want to be here anymore, I feel abused. Like I can never be myself because everyone has built up a perception of me and when I act like myself I'm ridiculed for being different or told that's not how it works or you can't feel that way.
The problem is I do feel this way and I always have, it's gotten to the point where I believe my own thoughts to be cancerous even if they make me feel better because I've been led to believe I have to be someone and something I just am not and every day I have to pretend that I'm ok and love this shit just feels like I'm slowly suffocating my real self.

I've gotten to the point over the last 3-4 months where I'm trying to die. I've pretty much stopped eating fruit in hopes vitamin deficiency will kill me. I try to avoid protein to just waste my muscles away. I've started only drinking alcohol and refusing to intake water, I've had 5 glasses in 2 weeks, just in hopes my kidneys shut down. I've even been trying to smoke cigarettes, which I fucking hate, just because I want to do damage to my lungs and have had asthma so I know they are getting fucked.

I feel like if I just leave this life behind, not suicide, then I could possibly become the person who I have always wanted to be. So i either can slowly watch myself rot and pretend to be alright, which what I've done for the last 15 years, or I attempt to try again somewhere else without any past, family or friends."
1,I HATE MY LIFE. Ok I don't have anyone icould talk fir him I hate my life and myself everybody is around me is afake I can't talk to anyone seriously sometimes I feel iam in dream and I can't wake up
1,"Life is hell. Society doesn’t give a fuck about me making me want to give up on everything because why even work and live if the world is garbage? I hate talking to people and I don’t like life. I can’t escape the hell that is life, everyday is more torture added on from the previous day. I’m a fucking slave that has to kill myself in order to be free. What is there to be happy about lol? My life is pretty much suffering everyday until the pain becomes too much and I reach the point of ending myself."
1,"Is there a way to go back to school without showing my face? (Serious). For anyone wanting to know, I'm not joking. I'm being dead serious."
1,"Just cuz. Anybody else feel sharp mood swings sometimes that are like unbearable? Like a little while ago I woke up from a nap super cranky and now I’m just aggressively sad. I know I need to get back to counseling once the pandemic cools down but it just feels like too much work. And over time, leaving my house has become more difficult. But I have no reason to be sad. It’s really lame."
1,"Maybe i'm not the best but. Maybe i'm not the smartest, neither the funniest, the bravest or the nicest. Maybe i'm not the most handsome, the tallest, but i deserve to die finally. Like what, you expected someone not good doesnt  deserve anything? Give me death it will be enough"
1,I got rid of my knives yesterday and I almost just bought more. I need to stop but I have no idea how. It's putting strain on everyone and everything around me. I need to stop. How do I do that?
1,"No one should be alone in the dark.. This sub fucking sucks. Life fucking sucks. I posted so many times on this sub with no avail. The truth is no one cares. No one ever cares. Until you start throwing tantrums in a failed attempt to gain attention. Only then will people judge you and tell you off. I fucking hate life. Just wanted to let anyone to know. But, we all know this post will be buried. Just like all of us into the ground. It's all meaningless. Nothing matters. No one cares."
1,I need advice. I wake up feeling like my stomach is trying to digest sand just churning and churning I also keep zoning out and only thinking about bad things such as suicide or other issues in like I’m also so stressed I feel like I could pass out at any second but at the same time I get woken up by the anxiety and guilt.
1,"If it werent for the covid19 I would have ended up dead. I will make it short

I am in my late 20s, graduated 4 years ago with a useless degree

Been working in retail part time and taking care of my ill parents and grandparents

My ""friends"" are already married or in a relationship with good and well paid jobs always bully me that I am a parasite who lives at home and it is my fault. Believe me that it is very difficult to find a good job with zero connections and move alone because no savings at all...

This covid19 that destroyed the global economy serves me as an ""excuse"" to why I still live with my parents because now I am unempLoyed but nowadays IT IS FUCKING NOT MY FAULT!!!!!!!!!! NEARLY 25% OF UNEMPLOYMENT HERE!!!!!!

So, without the covid19 I think that I would have ened up really depressed because of my failure to become a real person like everybody else. N eeded to vent."
1,It feels like I’m floating through life. It feels like I’m floating through life. If that makes sense. When I walk it feels like I’m not in my body but floating above it. It feels like a connection that’s almost fading. The world is blurry. Especially when I’m finally outside.
1,I came to help others. but i lost myself somewhere here. I'm listening to nickelback and that's the worst this anyone can do.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VRj2uw9L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VRj2uw9L0) gotta be someone right? I do hope everyone is ok
1,"I can't accept happiness anymore. I'm at a point in my life where happiness isn't an option anymore. Whenever I feel happy, I catch myself limiting this feeling, thinking I don't deserve it, it won't last and being happy is boring anyways. I feel good, being sad. I feel content with my life, a place of complacency, where I feel too good to change something, but too bad, to ever be truly happy. I feel that sadness gives me comfort in a twisted way. It gives me something to hold onto, something that I feel, if I try hard enough will never go away, unlike anything good that's ever happened to me. At this point I'd rather be sad, than change something about myself. I don't know if I'm making sense, I feel like I'm losing my mind."
1,"I truly believe I can't be saved. I'm too far gone now. I can't feel anything anymore.  I look inside myself to try to find something, anything, that tells me I'm alive. But all I feel is the need to die, or to just not exist anymore. I have nothing left but the hot coals of rage and the cool icy feeling of numbness. There is nothing else...I am beyond saving."
1,"Music that hits hard when we are down and why we listen to it. Hey everyone,
I'm someone struggling with depression since five years and have been lurking in this sub since a year or so. I've figured I won't be able to help anyone since I'm busy enough with my own thoughts, but I might as well post something interesting on here. Depression is a disease that tends to affect people with above-average intelligence, due to the fact that smarter people often overthink and/or start questioning themselves, life or even existence itself. 
I made a playlist and wondered why are we so obsessed with sad music, when listening to happy music would be the most logical thing to do. 
For anyone interested, my playlist consists of sad songs I listen to when times are difficult.
Link:
 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVw

First of all I gotta say that music is not a cure for depression and can even affect you in a negative way. The Playlist is just somthing I wanted to share.

So. Why do we like sad music?

When we listen to music we feel understood. We can see a glimpse of ourselves in the artist or song, that conveys the same emotions we feel. We feel better about our situation when we believe that someone else has experienced something similar and understands exactly how we feel. More importantly it validates our thoughts and makes us feel human and normal. At the same time, it allows listeners to bring their own negative emotions to the surface and vent them out, thereby reducing tension and stress.

Why do we hate listening to happy music?

As stated above, happy music would be the first logical thought at first, but often we do end up feeling worse than if we hadn't listened to happy songs. The best way to put it would be to compare both happy and sad with humans. The sad one is the understanding one who went through the same and is trying to console you, while the happy one is a annoying guy who always smiles at us and tells us to just cheer up and be happy.

Why do we like sad songs even when we're not sad?

Who in their right mind would choose a song that could heavily mess with their mood when there are happy alternatives out there?
Simply put is happy music often boring and fake. We as humans can't feel happiness for a extended period of time and get annoyed after a few songs.
Sad music is more moving and we connect to sad, romantic or even angry topics.

Effects of sad music on us:

""One might suppose that people become pessimistic when they’re sad; however, one research study proves that people are actually more realistic when they’re sad. This is due to a phenomenon called depressive realism. Compared with happiness, sadness has been observed to encourage more detail-oriented thinking and less judgment bias in people. Listening to sad music is believed to induce depressive realism, encouraging more realistic assessments of the likelihood of certain outcomes.""

1,"My dad passed away 3 days ago to Covid19. I can't seem to believe my father isn't here anymore. Even if we were never close because of things that happened between me, my mom and siblings, these last few years I tried to change and just let God guide him to a better path. We became sort of close the past 2 years. But I never got to say I forgive you. Never gave him a hug without feeling awkwardness now I find myself crying every time I remember all the promises we made together and knowing he isn't opening our house door anymore. He wasn't the best father in the world but he was the only father God gave me. I tried to be his friend...he was so lonely and I felt sad for him. His actions made no one want to get close to him but I felt bad for him even if for years I resented him...I always felt bad. I miss him. 

I still hope this is all a bad dream."
1,"Depression. Moments of joy are cut short by it, the sudden boosts of confidence and hope don't come around often anymore. If they come, they last a breath. My overthinking has become a huge problem, so instead of savoring moments I let them pass by because my mind is occupied with many thoughts, some of which will never happen. It makes me sleep bad if it lets me sleep at all. I wake up mad because I am alive, knowing the privilege but more than willing to pass it onto someone else."
1,Is drawing making people think that I am a useless being?.  I mean like people that draw (or who is dealing with art) for a living are seen as useless to the world. I like drawing because it helps me think away from all the bad shit and I wanna pursuit in my life as a software engineer but every time I show one of my drawing piece to one of my friends or family they encourage me to pursuit drawing instead and his advice makes me feel dumb(mentally) numb and useless. please help
1,"We should open everything back up. I hate Trump...but I agree with him that we should open up the country. I need to make my life better and I am growing bitter and angry at seeing people laughing and posting their dumb photos and fake concerns. I don’t care anymore-why should I care for a country...a society that sees me as a loser? Why should I care for a country that ignores me? Either way, global warming will still end humanity us all so we might as well get on with it. Sick and tired of people posting these cheery fake videos of qUAreNTinED and having a “hard” time inside their fucking houses. I get why people voted Trump-they want it to all burn. I’m jealous and hateful of everyone and everything and there’s no hope for me. I can never be normal."
1,"I can't take this shit anymore in getting worse everyday. No matter how much i try to feel positive, try to distract my self i just can't get better. I cry all the time, i become angry at small things. I just want to die i will never get better never fuck my life plz kill me plz I feel like a loser i can't sleep  i can't function like a normal human. The only thing i do is just cry cry cry and cry im sick of living this pathetic life i hope i die soon"
1,"This shit went downhill quick, didn’t it?. I’m 18, class of 2020. Ya perfect time for all of this to hit, really. Truth is, I was doing so well, like a lot of people here. I had finally clawed my way out to a “stable” mindset and really thought for once it was going to be ok for a little while. Coronavirus hysteria has held me hostage for a month now. I can’t see my boyfriend, and quite frankly it’s taken a toll on him, too. With both of us sinking into depressive episodes and being locked away, it’s hard to connect consistently anymore. I had no friends to begin with. I lost my job and now have a solid $26 to survive the next unknown amount of time with. My bed has a dent I’ve been laying in it so long.

My point is, just like everyone, I’m losing my shit in this quarantine. Every anxious, OCD, depressing thought is here to play. No amount of working out, arts and crafts, movies, or taking a walk will stop them anymore.

I’m sick of people saying it gets better. It’s not getting better, and I’m sick of lying to myself that it will be. My youth is being eaten up by some asshole who ate a bat. The perfect time for a depressed graduate to try to start up life is in a economic crisis, right?

Fuck the guy who ate the bat, fuck the people who can’t stay inside because “muh kids need 4 gallons of milk and 80 packs of toilet paper”, and fuck all of this. I’m tired."
1,"Daily happy time. Everyday of this journey is painful and hard, ot makes me more than tired and i don't know what to do to get out of it. BUT, everyday, i have this moment of the day where nothing matters, the night falls and everything seems cool, all the stuffs i was fearing about during the day just seems to fly out and I can just smile and talk to people. 

Just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this or smthing close to it !

I KNOW WE WILL OVERCOME THIS, BYE"
1,"I'm plunging into depression again as I'm very tired with work and everything but I don't have anyone to talk to.. So tired I just wanna cry. I try to keep myself from falling throughout the day. One may see me as prolly the strongest person in a work environment. But after it's over, I just wanna break down. So tired. What's the point of working anymore. I once thought it was to fullfil my desire to do what I love. Now it's just child's play for a handsome paycheck. It's meaningless. I'm just so lonely. Work, study, lift, eat, sleep. I just wish I had someone. So hard. so sad"
1,"Coronavirus has brought me to my breaking point. I'm in Ontario. I know location doesn't matter too much. I'm also considered an essential service. I do laptop repair for a major manufacturer. We support many other essential workers, so we're more backline, out of sight workers. Still essential.

I'm also an introvert. I do okay in large groups, but I prefer gatherings of less than 10. Even that has been taken away. I can't do my regular dinners with my mom, or my sister. My dad wasn't able to visit for Easter. I'm just stuck at work, or stuck in the damn house and I'm getting sick of it. I've had depression as long as I remember, I was diagnosed last year. I was doing so well. I've never done any type of visible self harm, though I've had addictions. Suicidal thoughts were a normal occurrence in my life, though I never made any attempts at my own life.

I was starting to get so much better. I was taking my medication. Thoughts of ending my life were not as prevalent in my mind. I was enjoying life. Enjoying spending time with loved ones. My wife and new son. Now I dread every moment. I'm worn out and there's no way for me to recharge. I hardly sleep. I'm at my breaking point and if something doesn't change I'm afraid of what I might do. Self harm is off the table but for how long? How much longer can I go on like this?

There's not really any point to this post. I just need to air out my thoughts somewhere anonymous."
1,"The Wall. The pain that is inside is being held back by a wall.

The wall is so high it holds everything in

The wall is so strong nothing can get out

The wall is a blanket staving off the outside weather

The wall is stifling but it protects

It protects too well and all feeling is a vague memory

If the wall falls the pain floods

LIke a horrible wave it can't be held at bay anymore

LIke a swollen river crashing and dragging it drags you under

The pain fills your lungs

You try and swallow it but its still there

The pressure on your chest is unbearable and so heavy

You're sure you will never breathe again

You give up

Then the wall rises once more and its stronger

Pain is once again held back

Everything is held back

I'm so numb"
1,Cannabis helps and also does not help me.. Sometimes it's exactly what I need and then sometimes it gives my the worst anxiety and depression. Anyone else get this?
1,"I dont think im going to be around in a years time. im 17 and i really dont want to live anymore. now this prob sounds like the edgy teenager that doesnt want to live anymore but listen, i genuinely dont want to. my life is going into the shit, and im not doing too good so im giving myself a year, it its still fucking shit and life is a giant burden and i cant find anything to live for then im out of here. im sick and tired of cutting myself and crying until i cant anymore. im sick and tired of missing someone who is with someone else. im sick and tired or just being stressed and never feeling happy. i really hope my life works out in a year but this is it ig. if i cant find anything to live for then i dont want to live anymore."
1,"My father was more ""overtly"" abusive to me, yet the thought of my mom, who escaped from him with me, finally realising MY pain after I'm gone is what brings me pleasure.. ~~We ran away~~  He kicked us out a decade ago, when I was 9, after witnessing horrible acts of physical, sexual and emotional abuse by his hands both to my mom and me (not sexual, that happened at the hands of other family members later)  for many years, pretty much since I was born.

Yet my mom and the rest of my family have always forced me to act like she was my saviour. No one likes it when I as much as try to bring up the fact that she was the one who cheated on him, she was the one who regularly left me alone with him, knowing full well he was making my life living hell.

When we left, that should've been the end of the pain. Not the ramp up; the part where the guitars start properly chugging and the LPFs are released.

And then she left. I was barely 13. She left to move to another city, because she wanted to live her life unbound by me. She wanted to date rich European men and hoe around. And that came at the cost of me being forced to spend the next 5-6 years of my life with my piece of shit paternal grandparents. Those who made clear that I was just a burden left on them unjustly.

All of this is a tiny, tiny, tiny part of my story, but it bears mentioning/ranting. I still fantasise about ripping and tearing my dad, sure, but no matter what I still have nothing but resentment for my mom. And considering I'll never be in a romantic relationship (not by choice), therapy and medication simply never worked for me in the 5 years I did try it, and emotionally fulfilling friendships over the web only go so far... There's really nothing left. Is there?

Maybe I'm the real villain here, and I just need to shut up. My suicide note will probably not even mention any of this considering how much more it hurts that I'll never ever have anyone who'll love me. Who'll show me what love is like when no one else did. Don't you dare tell me to love myself don't you fucking dare."
1,I ran out of antidepressants and it just made me... angry? Wtf. Biocitalopram or something. Lockdown means I can't get more currently so just yeah.
1,Why do you hide your feelings from your loved one (for those who do)?. I do it because I absolutely hate discussing my feelings.  It takes too much emotional effort
1,"I am so fed up with the people in this world.. For so long I’ve felt so empty. Nothing in my life seems to give any worth, nothing feels like it matters. 

I get a girlfriend, I still feel empty. I get friends, I still feel empty. I try and work on myself, AND I STILL FEEL EMPTY. 

The worst part of it is the anger though. I feel so angry at the world. Everyone is so stubborn and selfish. No one cares about each other anymore, maybe they never did. They don’t treat me with respect, they don’t treat others with respect. All they seem to respect is themselves. I swear to god I’m going to snap one of these days. 

When I was younger I used to think I was always the one that was wrong. I was the pathetic one, the stupid one, the weak one who would never amount to anything of worth. After years of this crap I’m done with it all. I’m not what’s wrong, the world is what’s wrong. Have we all gone crazy or something?! 

All life is, is building insecurities in the weak people, tricking them into thinking their lives will actually amount to something of value when they achieve what they’re missing out on. My whole life people made fun of me because I couldn’t get a girlfriend. Then when I was finally able to get over my social anxiety and talk to girls it didn’t even fill that goddamn hole in me! Everyone is awful, absolute fucking garbage. I am too, but at least I can see it. 

Lately this desire has been growing in my mind. Thinking about what it’d be like to have so much power that you can literally end everyone all at once. So many pathetic lives thankfully put to waste in a second. That’s all they are, just trash."
1,"Does anybody else feel misunderstood?. I'm just kind of venting here but I'm also curious to see if anyone can relate.

There's this friend that I have that I talk to quite often online through discord, and we're pretty close. But I always dread talking to her because of how she treats me. It's near impossible to get my point across on anything without her interrupting or changing the subject. Whenever I say something to intend one thing, she'll take it as another thing (if that makes sense) and she'll usually try to always one-up me in our conversations. Last night she talked about a little of what she struggles with, and I was there for her to comfort/support her. But when I tried to bring up myself and open myself to her, she ignored me and shot it down. She does say she hopes I can find peace or whatever, but she won't ever allow me to be myself with her (which would be really helpful) and when she talks to me, it's like she completely ignores what I tired to say. She can't ever seem to understand me when I try to talk to her, and I really want her to. And I **always** feel worse after every conversation we have.

But can any of you guys relate? Like you try your best to explain your situation to someone, and they say they're sorry or they get it. But when they try to help or give advice, it's in a completely different direction.

Or something like this."
1,"Vitamin D. Hey! I wanted to share a story in the hopes of maybe helping some people. So I have major depressive disorder and have struggled with it all my life. I was having a pretty bad episode after not having one for years when I went to the doctor to get some blood work for an unrelated reason. It turns out that I was severely difficient in vitamin D. I was perscribed pills, and they have had the biggest impact on my depression that any medication has ever had. It's like night and day. I'm currently going through a breakup that came out of nowhere and I'm actually doing ok. If you live in an area with overcast weather or rarely leave the house and don't get sun, I would ask your doctor about it, or if you can't do that just try some over the counter stuff. It's not a miracle cure even if you do have a difficiency, but it could really help."
1,"My therapist is busy, please give your thoughts. My ex and I are on very good terms. We are both struggling with depression and decided now wasn't a good time for either of us to be dating. 

Anyways, we are talking as friends and I am slowly but surely becoming ok with not being together as we were. It was a short relationship though it was codependent so bonds were formed very quickly and strongly. 

When I close my eyes I imagine she's holding me, telling me everything will be okay, as she has in the past. I am having a hard time seeing this as a friendship even though I know that's what's best for us both. 

Do you have any advice on how to handle this alone and viewing her as a friend? Also, any ideas on other things I can imagine when that image pops into my head?"
1,"My brain can’t comprehend its own stupidity.. I wasn’t always this stupid. A mixture of indulgence and bad timing made me like this. I was a smart kid and took it for granted. I had a general grasp on topics, but only took interests in sports, music, video games and girls. So dumb. I am utilizing none of these interests for my everyday life.

My father succumbed to cancer when I was 14 and I’m 22 now. He had it for 5 years prior and those years seemed to last decades and minutes at the same time. Decades because of how everyone approached me and treated me just because my dad had cancer. Minutes because of the knowledge I was able to extract from my dad. I always wish I asked more questions, but what did I know at that age. 

This dilemma stunted my growth into becoming who I am. I still don’t really know, honestly. I became numb to everything and stopped caring about my future because I didn’t know what life would be like without my best friend. It’s awful kid.

Now that I’m older and in my prime, I can only think about how I’ve wasted my life. Quitting college after a year, no girlfriend, no job and living at home again because of a pandemic. I don’t know where to go and I’m tired of pretending that life will find a way. Life’s “way”, leads me to more and more pain without any compensation. My patience for my death is dwindling daily. Idk why I made this post because you all have your own issues. I just want a reason to stay alive."
1,"Life wasn’t meant for me. Life just wasn’t meant for me. I’m unable to live up to the standards society has placed on me. As a 22 year old male, there is obviously a lot of them. Want examples? Ok. I’m expected to be tough and never show emotions, can’t do that. I’m expected to know a lot about cars and tools and all that, I don’t know any of that. In relationships, I’m expected to “be a man” and provide for women, make all the first moves, chase after scary sounds and bugs, do heavy lifting, provide for her while she just gets to be comfortable, I definitely can’t do any of that. I’ve never even been in a relationship, as someone with high functioning autism/aspergers, dating is pretty much rigged against me, so is society as a whole really. Women are cared about and have all these people fighting for them, I wish I had people fighting for me, I matter to nobody. Women are always cared about when depressed but males are just told to man up and deal with it. I’ve always wished I was a girl. If some of that sounds sexist I really don’t care, it wasn’t, and if that’s how you took it that’s too bad. I don’t have the strength, mentally and emotionally to live up to these standards, never can, and I never plan to. Already planning to kill myself soon, I’m beginning to overcome my fear of death and by the end of the year I likely will. Life clearly wasn’t meant for me, and I don’t plan to stick around, especially in a world that hates me. 

I know this is gonna be ignored, but I don’t give a shit at this point, I need I vent whether you all like it or not. It just proves my point about how I don’t matter."
1,Finding comfort in your depression?. So I’ve been going to a therapist and a doctor for almost 1 1/2 years now and I feel like I haven’t made much progress aside from understanding myself better. On December my doctor prescribed Adderal to me for my depression and ADHD and it was pretty good in keeping me focused and being happy I guess. But I stopped taking it after like a week. I haven’t taken any medication or visited my therapist since. Mainly because I swore I was finally gonna go back to college but never did. I was too ashamed to go back showing I had barely any progress. Plus I stopped taking medication. I know it would help me greatly but for some reason I just don’t want to get into that funk of feeling good and I’m not sure why. Is it because I simply am to attached to being depressed? It sucks because I feel like people that start therapy and all that start making noticeable changes in only a couple months and I haven’t done jack in almost two years. Like no progress and when the solution is right in my drawer(medication)  I don’t want it. I just need a better understanding of all this.
1,"Well. Back to starving myself.. I have always felt like I take up more than I deserve. I haven't eaten in 3 daya.

I wish it didn't feel so right. I take up so many resources and I can't work so why should I eat?"

1,A little bit of my story not full detail. Since I was 15  I have been fighting depression for the last 6 years after my mum sadly passed away I became badly depressed and down a few days after she past when it all sank in and then I started to have flash backs from that day when she passed and I starting to go to see a therapist and they asked me what I saw with the flash backs and I could not tell then but I remember being sat there drawing and then he said to me if you like drawing maybe you should draw me what you see I remember drawing my mum laid in a hospital bed with our whole family around the bad and in give him it and he kinda just sat there and did not say anything I ran out crying and went to find my dad in my local town lucky enough he was not to far away from where i was and I never really went to a therapist after that for a few years because I could not trust them and I started self harming really badly and after about 4 years of harming my self in many different ways I found a therapist that was amazing he actually listened to what i have to say and then he would say things back to me that actually made sense and here I am today where things went down hill for the most part had the worse brake down ibhave ever had I was sat there in my room just playing with my blades wanting to cut and out of nowhere my dad came in and saw them and I looked at him as he was about to walk out and I said stay a minute please and put the blades into the box I had been hiding them and I just said take this bin it it's my blades I dont need them anymore I came this for so just take them and get rid of them and I feel like today has been a massive turning point for me and I just want say to everybody in this feed YOU CAN OVER COME THIS JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF. STAY STRONG. Thank you for your time reddit
1,"Hey guys, just wanted to share a few thoughts that I've written down before earlier in the year.. It's a lengthy post but hopefully it makes you guys feel better by not realizing you're alone. I'm gonna make a part 2 as well. 

&#x200B;

My first mistake was learning to speak, if only I were born a mute. 

I got used to being made fun of that I started to do it normally in my mind.

My brain is so broken that negativity is my one and only normal.

Talentless and below average in a sea of those who will always be better than me. 

One mistake can lead to others that feel like a slight burn. I'll continue to make them until I'm completely engulfed in flames.

Yesterday was great. Too bad those days are so rare. 

My feelings are toys to be played with and then forgotten after some amount of time. 

My mood is bound to change in an instant to negativity so that I may be comfortable. 

Do I conform so easily to others opinions or do I take bits and pieces from others? Either way, they never feel like my own.

I want to satisfy those at my own dissatisfaction. 

Why are we cursed with lives of self-doubt, contradicting, and hateful thoughts?

Wanting to always be right about failing, I will sabotage myself if doing well or flat out refuse. What a disgusting creature I am.

Why is that whenever I'm happy, depressing, and negative thoughts come by the multitude? Like a woodpecker at a tree, they pick at my brain until they're in and settled. 

Suicidal ideation was once my full time job. 

I want to say I'm sorry and that it's all my fault, although I'm not quite sure what for.

We're all hypocrites to some degree or another. 

A time for everything, but mine has been mostly sadness. 

To believe I was once complete and not broken into tiny little pieces. 

Don't hate me. I already hate myself. 

After wanting to change for so long, it's finally here. Now that it is, I want nothing more than for it to go away. 

I was never the lion like I wanted to believe. I'm the dog in the corner, whimpering and cold, only wanting to love and be loved back. 

I can look past others deformities but not my own. 

I can forgive everyone. I just can't forgive myself. 

Instead of overcoming my problems, I succumb to them. I want to blame someone for that. But everytime I look for that person, I end up looking in the mirror.

Never improving. Always failing. The essence of who I am."
1,"Honestly, disappearing forever doesn’t sound so bad right now.. I can’t sleep right anymore. Waking up every few hours from a nightmare about her to cold sweat and a pillow full of tears is taking its toll on me. I kept having the same nightmares every time I close my eyes. I kept seeing her with someone else in my nightmares and I know she’s probably with someone else in my reality too. It hurts the most when you know she has moved on. How could she move on so fast? We broke it off for a few days and she’s already talking to someone new. Was it really love if she could just move on that fast from a 5 years relationship? 5 years and it only took her a few days to start talking to someone new? I know I did many things wrong and I regret every single one of them, but how can she just throw away 5 years full of memories for a new person just like that? 

The pain is too much, my head hurts, my heart hurts, everything hurts. I’ve been spiraling with hard drug abuse and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I told myself I would never touch those substances ever in my life, yet here I am, abusing everything I could get my hands on.

She had blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her. It fucked me up knowing how I was the one she came to at 3am when she needed me the most, the one that I held on right when she had nightmares but also the one who disappeared when I felt the lowest and loneliest. 

I just hope I could call her and maybe hearing her voice would stop me from ending it all one day. Maybe she could convince me to keep living and the pain will subside. But for now, I hope it will look like an accident."
1,"I can’t anymore. I’m just done, I have fought and fought but nothing gets better. I was happy like I was so fucking happy with my life and where things were at but 3 weeks ago everything started to just fall apart, I don’t have a job anymore, The love of my life dumped me and I lost my nan, I thought it was okay because I blocked out all my emotions so I didn’t feel anything for a while but the past two weeks everything is too much for me. The only thing I want to honestly do is die because everything is too far gone to make things good again. I  just want to slit my wrists and be done with it because people are gonna care just for a little while then their lives will go on like normal. I am useless and just a terrible person, I don’t know when but soon I’m gonna at least try have the balls to just fucking end it because there is no point for me to live anymore. It’s only when I feel so sad and depressed that people give a shit. IM FUCKING DONE I CANT FUCKING DO THIS FUCK THIS PLACE AND FUCK THIS WORLD."
1,"Anyone else about to snap?. I'm sure a lot of us are in this situation, but anyone else about to snap?  


1- I don't care about isolation, I tend to be a lone wolf anyways, not having to deal with people in person is fantastic.  


2- I'm very very very close to putting a bullet in my skull. So here in Canada we have something called EI ( employment insurance ) and CERB.   


I've spent the better part of Oct onwards (Until around March) being unable to work due to a shoulder and ankle injury. I went into Jan telling myself that I can finally work again and not starve myself each month, then all this bs hit.  


Now because I didn't work, I'm not eligible for either the CERB or EI. Ditto for 100's in my situation, students etc.   


3- I've lost track of how many things I've punched this last few weeks. I know my knuckles are bruised up and me usually being civil and patient and friendly, has gone off the deep end and is about ready to put said bullet in my head. As a bonus, my counselor ( who is amazing ) can't work due to all this shit and it'll be a very long time till I find someone like her again. 

  
So who's with me and wants to completely snap? Our respective government have shown they don't care about certain people, so why should we abide by their bs and stuff when we're the ones getting fucked over?"
1,"Kinda lost man. I don't really know if this is the right subreddit but I have no idea where else to turn. I'm a guy so it feels like no one really takes me seriously. 

Fuck man I'm getting so tired and I don't know how to express what I'm feeling and English is not my först language so this might be just me rambling incoherently and I'm sorry about that but I hope you can bare me out cause I really need to get this shit off my chest... 

My mom and dad split when I was very young 
My mom had 2 kids before me and a lie after me, all with different men and all of them bailed and left my mom with the kids(except my dad). 
She used a lot speed and gambled her way into debt and struggled alot with mental illness 
She couldn't handle everything so i moved to my dad and his new woman (I call her mom) and her daughter (my big sis) when I was 2. 
From there on I spent 1 week at my dad and then 1 week at my moms. So I was kind of the outsider of both of my families, this continued for quite a while, 2 different sides of life. 

1 week at my dads place, which was a nice smalltown with a nice daycare and school and 1 week with my mom and my now 3 other siblings (i got a new younger sister) wherever we lived at the moment ( she moved around quite a lot) 

I liked to be at my moms place, she wasnt as strict as me ex military dad but he had his reasons. But I spent my entire childhood going back and forth between two different worlds and missing out on both, not feeling like I was in center of anything, on my moms side I think I was seen with some resent for being able to live with my fancy dad and still being the most chaotic of us. And at my dads they saw me as a kid who couldn't behave. 

I was outside everywhere. Friend groups, family and just mentally alone, but god knows I tried, I tried way to hard and that fucked it up for me everytime but I tried. My parents hated eachother for so long and I was a pawn in my moms game and I ended up hating my dad for many years and I Will always hate myself for that, he was hard on me but he is a goddamn good dad and he tried. He even tried when I was a heavy drug user at 16 to 20 years old. He saw me take my older brothers (moms side) steps and he couldnt see all the mental problems I had and I don't blame him, he grew up where men didnt show that they suffered so it angered him. 

I was pretty good at masking my lonlieness with friends who liked that I did stupid shit and that I got angry easily. But Fuck I spent so many years crying myself to sleep and sleeping in the warmth of the shower. I just wanted to feel like I belonged. 
Fast forward to 2017 and many drugs and bad behaviour, my parents kicked me out and I spent a year couch surfing and sleeping rough until I met my girlfriend, half a year after my ex cheated on me with my friend and after I vowed to never trust love because I fall really easy and I have bad judgement but damn it was like the sky turned and I felt like home, I can't describe it but it felt like your soul got a warm close hug after staying at the bottom of a cold sea. All my self harm, all the cuts, all the drugs, every lonley night every single time I tried to make it over the edge of that fucking bridge, every overdose. It was all worth it and I would have done it 10 times over. She was so goddamn beautiful, and those eye man... those eyes. I would break every bone in my body just to look into those eyes and be certain that it was with love they looked back at me again.

The first mistake I made was that I went to fast, I moved in in under a month and I was blind to the signs. I know I fall for the broken type and you'd think that comes with a certain eye for when things are sketchy but no. It took me 4 months until I realised that she was cheating with multiple guys and I stood there outside the window and seeing her in panties on a guy on the couch. That was 2 years ago on the 9th of april and I'm too this day certain that a part of me died that night. I went in and picked up my stuff and went on my way to my first OD in a while. I survived. I licked my wounds for a while knowing I had to keep of the drugs I had already damaged my family, my mom my dad and my 2 angels ( my younger sisters) I couldnt get lost again, I needed them to see me happy and alive.

My girlfriend wanted me back and I couldnt walk away from that feeling I had before, even if that meant living with the old familiar feeling of never being someones number one. For a year forward I was treated like shit and still saw signs of infidelity until I caught her with more then just messages. She had been to a guys place pretty close to where we lived so I went to talk to him (She was at Home every day while I was working full time so we could survive) he told me they had met but nothing had happened, but that she had been coming on pretty strong but he didnt like her.

 I Think she was looking for a guy similar to the guy I first guy I caught her with... She would have done anything for him. It took her over a year to post that she was in a relationship with me because she was afraid what he would think. I did everything for her but he was still number one. 
Anyways... 

I confronted her and she told me she loved me now, forreal and she had problems and wanted to change so she changed (or cleaned up her act) and she worked on herself and slowly began to treat me better. But it never felt like she's really attracted to me like she had been to other guys, even then when really hot women came onto me I never gave or give anyone a single signal. Instead I'm always there for my baby, when she is down i leave work and come Home, when we fight and she turns it around to be my fault I say Im sorry, and its slowly killing my self respect. And now 2020 its much better between us and I have my son (my dog) who means the world to me and my family is so proud of me and everyone turns to me with their problems cause its easy to talk to me and I understand them but I'm so fucking lost, I'm a guy but why does noone hug me when Im down, why do a man have to ask his woman to go an extra mile to pick him up. Why is a man seen as annoying when he is needy? Why do only girls deserve romantic gestures that solidify what love someone have for them. Im so tired of being ashamed for being down and sad, for crying and not being able to pick myself up and be happy. Why don't I deserve to feel like I know where home is? I cant see a home in the world as it is and it breaks me every single day to wake up with this feeling, being surrounded by people but feeling like the lonliest man alive, deattached from everyone. I cant even sleep and find peace cause there are the nightmares and sleep paralysis waiting and the sleeping meds are a joke, the therapist meetings just makes me feel more alienated. I'm just so fucking lost

sorry for the bible."
1,"I'm just scared. I still live with my parents because I'm 15 iv been depressed since around 11. I don't know how to explain it I'm just a bunch of stuff 
I'm scared for my future, if I'm gona have a good life or be homeless 
My grades are low and it's hard for me to fix them 
My parents usually yell at me because of that eaven tho I'm trying my best to make the situation better 
I want to die but I don't 
I have so many things I enjoy in life, things that I love and are hard for me to leave 
But at the same time I just feel empty and sad
I don't want to die because it will hurt my parents and make them think they where the cause 
It's hard for me to eaven imagine my mom's reaction to my death 
I can't realy be alone a loot so I mostly cry when I shower. That and seeing my body makes me eaven more sad because I don't like how I look it just makes my self esteem shrink 
I have dreams and things I want to do but il never get a chance to do
I want to become an digital artist but I dont believe that I can do it. That and the fact that my country dosent realy put value in art stuff (I'm from Croatia)
I'm also gay and in a very religious family that is kinda toxic my mom and sister accept me but we don't talk about it. I don't think il ever get a boyfriend because of how homophobic my country is.
I'm scared that il be a fail, that I won't have money when I grow up or that I will die alone.
Bearing open to toxic religion from school in 3-4th grade elementary wasn't helpfull. Seeing somebody my age that is better than me makes me fall apart, I had a bunch of mental breakdowns in the school bathroom.aside from that a week beafore the schools where closed a group of guys got a pic of me in the bathroom stall and shared it around the school, that made me stay home till the schools where closed.
I don't know what to do any advice is good."
1,"I have no one to turn to. I’m going through a hard time in my life (isn’t everyone these days).
I think I might be breaking up with my long term boyfriend. And I’m... pretty broken up about it. Constant, fat tears... I couldn’t stop shuddering... I was in physical pain and it felt like my chest was collapsing in on itself. The worst part about this is that he was my only friend. I literally have *no one* to talk to about this. I don’t have a support system. It was just him. I know that was unfair, but I was trying to change it. All of my friendships have fallen apart for various reasons that I had nothing to do with. I don’t feel close with my family. I didn’t mean to make him my only point of support. I guess it doesn’t matter now. I have no one to message and just talk to. Of all the people I do know, I’m not close enough to any of them to reach out. They’re not anything beyond surface level friends. It’s not their fault, or bad necessarily. They’re good people. I don’t blame them. I feel a sense of mourning. I never got to tell him that for months I have been thinking about how great it will be to put his towel in the dryer while he showers, but I didn’t want to tell him (and I’m terrible at keeping secrets) because I wanted to see the surprised look on his face. I’ll never see that now. I feel weird “mourning” the family we would have had and the life we would’ve built. Thinking about that makes me wonder if I’m making a mistake by stepping back, but talking to him right now is bringing such great emotional pain that I physically hurt. I never wanted this to happen. I was afraid something like it would. I’m realizing now that is what I’d be telling a friend if a had one. Now that I’ve slept a little and I’m sitting here... I feel this calm melancholy. My chest still hurts but I’ve stopped crying. I desperately don’t want it to be... but I think it’s over. I have this feeling, like... it’s hard to describe. I know I’ve been too much of a burden on him, and he’ll never directly tell me but being with him is too much for him and it’s hurting him. I’m hurting him by being with him because of the way I am. I question if I ever actually worked on myself... I think I did. But in hard times I have been melting a little, and I think it’s just too much. This, combined with som other crap that happened a little while ago, just makes me feel so... numb. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet to be honest. 
I love him so, so very much but the pain is just too much. Some of it isn’t his fault but I also feel like he could’ve taken a leap of faith for me, and didn’t, and I’m crushed. I thought I had shown that I would have his back, but thinking backwards in time to other conversations we’ve had, it’s clearer to me he doesn’t completely trust me for some reason and I don’t know why. His schooling means so much to me, I wouldn’t have gotten in the way of that... I would’ve done everything to help make it easy. Make help him staying here as comfortable as possible. I believed he’d want to stay, to weather this storm together... but I was wrong. Said he didn’t think it through enough. He talked to his family and they advised against it... I understand because of the circumstances... I feel like they mistrust me too... for some reason there was some perceived ill intentions in things went down... but I just wanted to see him. They said it was okay and after believing all this time he’d come be by my side, he said no. And it’s not just that he’s not here with me. He thinks I wouldn’t do everything and anything to help facilitate his success and help him thrive. I don’t know why. A long time ago, we were talking about something to do with school, and I can’t remember the specifics but he said something to effect of “I don’t trust you to not get mad at me for doing my work” or something. And I *heard* him, and I swear I wasn’t doing anything but being supportive of him going to school but he felt like I’d impede him. I was crushed then, we were sitting in my car but I made an excuse to go to the bathroom to go cry. I don’t know what I did to make him feel like he can’t trust me.... I trust him completely and it lead to my heart feeling so broken. I feel like a sore idiot for going on about being sad and “heart broken” but if you really think someone is the one and it gets messed up... I’m reeling. If I had known that the last time I saw him was gonna he the *last* time... I can’t think about it too much or I’ll just cry. I don’t really know what to say now. I tried to keep my cool so that he’d see I was trying to be responsible, and he’d see I was trying to be good. I didn’t want to lose my marbles and ask him why or be sad, I’ve ruined any chance of seeing him at all. None of this has properly sunk in. I don’t have to save my Instagram memes anymore, all of what I have saved is... just... nothing now. I’ll never get to hug him again, I can’t show him how much I care and that I’d never hurt him and that I want him to feel whole and happy... I’ll never get to live with him and warm his towels or have his beans or know what it’s like to be with him. I feel like I’m doing something rash... but there’s this weird calm... I think it has to be this way... he will be able to thrive without me, and I know he’ll be able to do his work with flying colors... I’m not worried about that. But I just feel so... lost. 


What now ?"
1,"Zero motivation to learn anything new. I've come to the realization that I don't want to better myself if it involves teaching myself. I hate learning that way and it's not as effective as having a mentor or teacher present. 

I'm in the marketing field and it's very ""never stop learning"" and "" you should be using the quarantine to create a new side hustle or get a new skill"". I have zero motivation to further my learning even when there's no quarantine. I want to move up in my career but without a teacher, mentor, or even someone else in my field that I can go to, it's near impossible. 

I literally need someone to walk me through things, which people might see as hand-holding. I'm aware that people can't just walk me through life, but there's gotta be some kind of solution

I don't know anyone else who feels like this so is this normal? I WANT to want to learn, but straight up I do not want to learn a new skill. I know it will get me further in my career and my life, but I just can't bring myself to care.

I'm on antidepressants and they've worked wonders for me the past year, but I can't get past this hurdle. It's starting to affect my job and such. Any advice is appreciated!"
1,"What is depression. As someone who is depressed my opinion is that depression is just being repeatedly sad day after day due to lack of endorphines due to lack of anything for example if i suddenly met a girl (and ive never been in a relationship) that i liked i would get a natural release of endorphines causing me to feel good, do you think i would feel depressed at that moment? Then if that girl became my partner and i spent time with her every day i would get a release of endorphines so i wouldnt be depressed at those times, enough endorphine released could keep you feeling stable or happy for a few hours without any activity(i think), isnt it wrong for depression to be diagnosed and treated like a mental illness?"
1,"Today my therapist asked me if I think I'm in danger of hurting myself. I've been suffering from recurrent depression for years and have been seeing a therapist for about four months now, as I was no longer able to handle it myself. 

It's been bad before, but I think I've hit an all-time low  during the past weeks. Social and financial insecurity keep eating away at me, pressure from all sides to perform is crushing every will to go on, recent failures on search for jobs diminish every last bit of self-esteem and not being able to socialize during a damned pandemic takes away all my coping mechanisms. And finally, not having had a SO other to catch me for more than 7 years leaves me be lonely when times are toughest. Like that, I've been dragging myself from appointment to appointment with my therapist for the past weeks.

Yesterday, I burst into tears several times during the day, as I found myself reaching my limits. I wrote down all my thoughts and fealings to show my therapist today. 

After reading, he asked me if it would be possible that I'd end up hurting myself, or possibly worse, in my current situation. 

I've been thinking about this before, but never with any intent. My pride would never allow me to take that step. Also, I value myself and my life way too much to consider suicide. I'd rather have everything else go to shit and leave all things behind.

However, being asked this question left me scared with the need to tell someone."
1,"I'm a broken shell of a human. I'm 27, but for like the last 15 years, getting worse each day, I resemble a broken, 60 year old widowed alcoholic who has given up and now just sits around drinking and smoking himself to death.

I have not A DROP of energy, or hope, or motivation, or goals in me. Not a drop. All I have is agony. 

I have been so fucked by my brain ever since I was a small kid, that I am literally a walking zombie at this point.

My eyes are tired and sunken in. I can barely keep them open and always look angry/sad. 

The corners of my mouth might as well have weights on them, that's how low they are by default. 

I am out of energy and falling asleep within 11am no matter how much I sleep, how I eat, exercise, and no matter what vitamins I take. 

I CANNOT shake the suicidal ideation for one second no matter what I do. 

No matter where I turn, the thoughts are there. And they will make sure I hate myself so much that I'm afraid of washing the dishes in case I just fucking slice my wrists with that big ass kitchen knife out of despair 

Idk what I'm saying. I'm just laying in bed trying not to cry like all the time, fantasizing I'd get cancer or a brain aneurysm to save me"
1,Dissoation. My alters have been out way more recently and I’m scared. I feel like like I’m fading and I don’t know what to do.
1,"I think I'm going insane. I really don't know what else to say other than that. I really can hardly talk to someone without getting pissed or start rambling coherently. It's like, everything in real life, the world, and stress of having to live alone with a family who are pushing me against a wall when it comes to mental health.

To put it mildly, I feel like I'm starting to lose it, mind-wise. Perhaps it is just a side-effect of being Depressed in general, or maybe I am going Clinically Insane. Wow. That's fucking wonderful, isn't it?"
1,an update. still lonely as shit the voices are worse now and now i see things and i wanna die even more
1,"I just don't want to be alive anymore. Simple as that. I've lost my faith in everything and I reached my lowest point in depression again. I just can't see meaning in anything and I can't see hope in the future it's all like a deep dark tunnel without an exit. I've been depressed for a really long time and I'm tired of living like this. What's the point of living if you're feeling dead inside every day? What's the point of living when you're alone, not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard you try
I wish I was brave enough to end my life but I'm scared of attempting suicide and failing again but in the same time I just feel so suicidal and I can't go through life like this anymore. Bro I can't take it, I really can't, I swear"
1,"i need help. I need help. I feel like I'm in a desperate situation. I don't know how to figure myself out. There's less light. About me: I'm just a regular guy 18 years old. No bad habits. I've only got a couple of close friends I can share the most intimate things with. A family where I've been brought up quite freely. But talking about my experiences and feelings in 80% of cases ends in misunderstanding on their part, so I stopped sharing something deep with them. I'll get to the problem. It's based on the choice of future professions. Three years ago, when my peers were deciding who they wanted to be, I couldn't identify any traits and hobbies that might have been prerequisites for my adult life. My parents advised me to be a doctor, because I would always have money for ""bread"" and I wouldn't be lost or anything like that. Their ghostly beliefs imposed on me as a 15-year-old seemed convincing and I decided to get ready to go to medical university ... 3 years have passed. During that time, the thought that I was doing something wrong came to me occasionally. It was a year of passing exams with graduation and other formalities. The results of my exams were average, which did not satisfy my parents and I entered a higher education institution of our regional center, not a decent one. Even though I understood that my university was far from being prestigious, the understanding that my adult life had begun caused an ephemeral feeling of trembling before something new. But after two months of study, I began to realize that the university really sucks, because Russian education is one big disappointment (Yes, I am from Russia). I can tell you about the reasons. I feel devastated by broken expectations and an epiphany from the deep sleep I have been in all these years. I have no desire to learn. Parents try to understand when they missed the moment that everything came to what we have at the moment. I hope I was able to at least partially convey my message to you. I'm not depressed, but sadness and apathy tell me that everything leads to it..."

1,"I am messing up everything in my life and I can't talk to anyone about it..  I am a 17 year old boy living in India and I am having a tough time living. A little background check - I am from an upper-middle class family, we live a decent life. The past 2 years have been very hard on me and I feel like 2020 is going to be even worse. I constantly fight with my parents for petty reasons and then I cry about it at night, I shout at them, and then regret it later. 2019 was a bad year, initially, till mid May, I was suicidal, I even put a blade to my wrist but somehow I stopped myself. I found a girl, the kindest, most beautiful girl ever, and I fell in love. But as the title suggests, I messed it up. I fell in love with her, she fell in love with me too, but I had a female friend with whom I was a little too flirtatious. Even though me and my girlfriend (who is also depressed and used to cut herself often and is now on medication) weren't dating at that moment, I had the FUCKING audacity to talk the other girl as if I liked her. That made my girlfriend hurt herself. Me and my girlfriend, we were making out and immediately after that, I described a sex dream about the friend, WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT, I TOLD HER THAT I WOKE UP WITH A BONER???? Even after all this, my girlfriend stayed with me, and then she told me that she wants me to not talk to that friend BUT I SAID NO I WILL NOT STOP TALKING TO HER, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I SAID NO. Then my girlfriend threatened to leave me if I didn't stop to talking to her, and after realising that my sanity was at stake, I told her that I will stop talking to her, BUT HERE'S THE CATCH, I WAS STILL TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND DIDN'T TELL MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT. After she confronted me about it, I finally stopped talking to her, but I guess it was too late. We didn't break-up, but she started bringing up breaking up with me frequently because of the way I treated her, she's right. I then, after realising how bad I fucked up, I started making amends, started trying to redeem myself but to no avail. Today, it has been 8 months since we started dating and one of her puppies died and I told her that I used to hurt myself because when she used to get mad and used to tell she'd rather be with ""A guy she knows"" because he wouldn't hurt her from the beginning, even though I swore never to hurt myself again. And now she doesn't want to be with me and also feels like killing herself because she hurt me, even though it is my fault and I should've told her earlier, she takes the blame on herself and doesn't want to be with me anymore. But I love her so much and she's the one person I'm never going to give up on, no matter what she says, it's either her or nobody else, now I am not trying to be toxic or manipulate her into staying with me, but I really don't want her to go, the pain of separation is way too much for me to deal with. I am sitting in my room with my lights off, tears rolling down my cheeks listening to death bed by POWFU thinking she was probably better off without me. I don't think I can live anymore."
1,"Dealing with depression or whatever i have.. So, i am new to reddit and i dont quite know how everything works yet, but i have been thinking about posting because i always read reddit about medications and depression/anxiety/bipolar to see others experiences and how they deal with them.

I have never been properly diagnosed. Well, I've been to many different people and i have gotten many different diagnosises: major depression, bipolar, schizophrenic. So, i have a lot of confusion within myself with my situation and its quite frustrating. It would be helpful to know whats going on with me so i could deal with what i have going on as best as possible. 

I guess im just ranting because i dont know i how to feel or what to do with anything i have going on. I feel so debilitated. On top of that i take medication, which is another annoying and confusing process within itself (having to figure what works for you and what dose works for you). I take Lamictal 400mg right now, but i dont know if thats too much because i feel like im having some cognitive issues like forgetting what im going to say mid sentence or have nothing to think of in general (very blank), but like i said very confusing because i dont know if its the medication doing that or the condition/mental illness that i deal with. Also, sexual dysfunction is THE WORST... Im 20 so this is a issue for me when it comes to medications. I never know how to feel about what im taking and when it comes to medication i am very impatient and freak out at the beginning when i start to feel all of the intial side effects. When that happens I'll self medicate and switch my dose by myself. I know this wont help anything, but ill have anxiety about it and just make a rash decision.

Sorry about the long post, but i feel like i dont have people that deal with similar issues to talk about this with. I feel like giving up a lot because i just dont know what to do anymore or how to fix myself or at least be a functional person. I've distanced myself from my friends and people i love and feel like I've ruined my relationship with my girlfriend because of the crazyness that i deal with and in turn put on other people.

Im lost and dont know what to do... HOW DO YOU DEAL OR GET OUT OF THIS?????"
1,"I ""basicly"" got...raped. Hi,

this is very actually pretty fucking hard for me to talk about this and its not a good way to post it on the internet. But I have to stand my fear. My heart is beating really fast.

So when I mean basicly, the process was the same, but with clothes on...It was in somewhere 7th grade maybe a year later. So its like 6-8 years after it happend. He bullied me 24/7 and he is one of the reason why I have depression, social anxiety etc. Im not sure how long it was all I did was trying to kick against his shinbone. But it didnt work, he just kept going. I just tried everything with my strength but I was too weak. After I dont know how long he let me go and we went back to class.

I want to kill this guy actually so bad. I remember his fucking name and if my life wont go better or just trash, I swear I will kill him, then kill myself no joke actually.

btw Im a boy if that matters anything. 

Im not sure what the fuck to expect as an answer. Im not even sure anyone will. But I really need any answer to this. Like...i dont know say something. Ill talk with my therapist about this tomorrow."
1,"I feel like i need to be beat down to get better.. It's very hard to explain, but I've been in a very fragile state the last year or two, and I feel like I'm finally opening my eyes for the first time. Due to some unfortunate traumatic events, I was taught at a very young age that anyone you trust can betray you and ruin your life, but somewhere along the lines, I still adapted a rather selfless personality (That isn't self-flattery). 

I have a serious problem with putting people before myself. Not so much doing favors and sacrificing my own, letting them walk all over me, but I invest all of my time thinking about my friends, partners, and family, alongside all their issues. I'm well aware that their problems aren't mine to take on, but I overthink them regardless. Same applies to my own issues, but it's much worse. Especially with the quarantine, I've been given a large amount of time to sit and think things over and over to the point of unhealthiness.

I've begun distancing myself from people, and usually that'd be a major sign to myself that things are getting bad, but it actually feels like my first step to healing. I am a very socially oriented person, and It's seriously taken a toll on me. Not to mention the fact that most of the people in my life wouldn't even put a fraction of as much thought into me as I do them. 

In an ideal situation, I isolate myself entirely from everyone, and take this time to learn how to focus on myself and bettering who I am. My only problem, however, is that I'm very back-and-forth with things (eg. leaving a partner, claiming it's for mental healing, and then coming back mere days later)  I convince myself that everybody overthinks as much as I do, and i convince myself i want that. I convince myself that I'm happy in whatever situation I'm in, and it always brings me back, no matter how terrible the scenario. 

What I feel like I need is a sign, I feel like I need something to remind me to never truly trust anybody, I need to be reminded that I never really mattered to them, because I don't. I need to push myself away from contact because somewhere through the years, I never learnt to be truest to myself. I need to be told that people leave and people die, and the only constant in my life will ever be me. I need to gain that sense of selfness that I'm sure could better me as a person.

&#x200B;

That being said, It's 9:46 Am and I haven't  slept in two days, so this may be total nonsense. If anyone decided to read through this total dumpsterfire, well, Thank you, very very dearly. It means more than you know."
1,"Why do I hate this. I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they aren't physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I'm in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I'm 6'2"", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I'm so fucking depressed.
I told my parents that I haven't been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.
I only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.
I drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I'm actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.

Please if you're not actually depressed don't say you are it's people like that that make me not come forward and people that don't recognize depression as a real condition"
1,"I lost my only friend because I'm an idiot.. I had an online friend for 2 years. He was the only one I talked to for 2 years. He talked me out of commiting suicide and helped me through depressive episodes. But then my dumbass starts to fall for him. At first it seemed like he felt the same, but then out of nowhere he told me he couldn't do it because he was too depressed. I respect that, but he also doesn't want to continue our friendship. He says it wouldn't be the same. I ffng loved him, he was the only person in te world I cared about. I feel so alone, I feel like I'm losing it. Why does everyone I care about walk out on me. It's come to the point where I don't see the point in continuing my life and it's killing me slowly."
1,"Family history of early death.. I was wondering if I'm alone in this thinking -
My parents and grandparents died at fairly early ages...50's to 70's.
As I consider the early ages of my parents and grandparents deaths, I am preoccupied with the idea that I am genetically predisposed to follow suit.
So, at the age of 60, I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop, so to speak (develop cancer or something).
I've dealt with severe depression all my life...and now at my age, this preoccupation feeds right into my depression.
Is there anyone out there that deals with something similar?"
1,"It’s 3am and I can’t let myself fall asleep because last night I had a bad dream. Well.. the dream was actually a good one. It was waking up that was bad. I dreamt that my old best friend was still alive. He was at his moms house and he had only faked his suicide. The dream was SO vivid, it was so real, when I woke up it felt more like a memory from yesterday than a dream. I knew it was a dream thought and it send me into a spiral of unanswered depression questions. Did he mean to die? Could I have prevented it? Did he want help? Etc

I wish I had a time machine."
1,"I'm going to kill myself.. I think I've come to terms with it. Thats how I die. I know when. I know how. I know why. There is an odd sense of relief that comes over me when I think about it, I don't have to worry about anything anymore. No more loneliness, no more pain. It will all be over soon, all I have to do is wait a little bit longer and it will be perfect."
1,"A close friend leaves my messages unopened, when I attempt to open up about my depression. I helped him through a similar struggle about half a year ago. I know it isn't good to keep score in friendship but it is beginning to bother me. Any advice on what I should do is welcome.. Around a year ago I fell into quite a bad depression as well as anxiety. In order to save time I won't go into the details of my personal symptoms. 

However for the last 3-4 months, I've been making quite a big effort to pull myself out of the depression with some success. However from time to time daily I do fall back into my old thought patterns. During this time I usually managed by keeping to myself(for 2-3hrs) and making an effort to keep myself busy through one of my hobbies (I'm 17 and live with my family so talk to them regardless of my mood). Usually my sprinting practice is the most successful at getting me out of the mental state. 

Very recently I began speaking to a counselor (online due to the quarantine circumstances). It hasn't caused much difference yet but I am still hopeful. The counselor recommended that I still reach out to 1 or 2 closer friends during times where I feel like this. This is different to my usual method however I was happy to try it.

**The main issue:**

When choosing someone to talk about it with, I chose a friend who I know had also been through a similar mental struggle and had opened up to me about it. When this happened, I was always happy to talk to him and help him through it. Therefore I assumed it'd be good to talk with him as he'd be able to relate. 

However, when I've tried talking about what I'm going through with him after a few messages he'll just leave my message unopened (for around a day), this is unusual because if we're having a usual conversation he'd reply sooner. After having done this he'll begin a conversation on a completely different topic. Basically ignoring what I said before. The first time this happened I just ignored it thinking that it was probably a coincidence. I spaced out each attempt by a few weeks. However after the 2nd and 3rd time it began to bother me. Especially when I see him posting on his story or group-chats etc.

Therefore, I am wondering if anyone has had something similar happen? and what did they do about it? Should I just communicate what I've noticed and be honest that it's bothering me (this feels quite odd for me to do as I'm usually quite a jokey person and we usually joke around together)."
1,"I'm glad I'm suicidal. I haven't been suicidal since 4th grade and it feels really good to be back in this situation. I have always had chronic depression but it hasnt been this dark in years. 

I know the title is clickbait but I truly feel this way. It feels like now I've hit a new low and I can make progress to get out of it. Chronic depression is frustrating because it's a constant kinda shitty feeling. It's like wanting to cry after a hard day, week, month and not being able to. Once you finally cry it's so freeing and cathartic. 

Right now I feel more positive than I have been, maybe ever. It's only up from here for me. Maybe I'll have a few down turns but ultimately its for the best"
1,"I'm tired of my life. I'm 24 years old and my life has been a series of failures. I'm not a very social person I've been like this ever since I was a kid, for most of my life I didn't have any friends. Even now I don't think I really have friends just acquaintances. No one ever asks about me, even my family stopped asking when someone contacts me it's usually because they want something from me or need me to do something for them. I'm a collage drop out and been working dead beat jobs that I hate with a passion. I used to be in a relationship that lasted 3 years but the other person dumped me because I was boring and  their friends didn't like me. I've pretty much gave up on dating and taking care of myself. I tried to reconnect with my family but they really don't care about how I feel they only care about what people think of me and not to ruin the family's name so we don't really get along. My conversation with the family are very brief and always end in awkward silence. I've been spending most of time alone in my room and lost interest in everything. My days are a slow blurr cause I don't do much. I used to spend most of my free time playing video games cause they distracted me a bit from how much I hate my life. Things have gotten worse lately and I've been spending all my time outside of work rotting away in my bed. I don't ever remember myself crying but lately I've been crying everyday on the drive back from work and I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and I'm scared and don't know what to do.
I don't have any friends or family to talk to and I'm piss broke and can't afford a tharapist. I tried to look for free help online but it usually leads to a person telling me to pray my thoughts away."
1,"i took a sip of bleach. &#x200B;

I've been depressed before and I've tried to kill myself twice but I failed both times. Life is going great for me but I've been feeling numb the past few weeks, I can't seem to figure out why.

I have no one to talk to or could help me anymore, I've lost the privilege of having someone I could hold onto/count on so usually I'd cut my tummy with a razor to calm myself down but today, 

I was crying really hard about NOTHING and I walked into the laundry room and straight up took a long sip of bleach and poured it all over me, I ruined a set of pjs and my favourite socks.

Then I cleaned up the laundry room and went into the shower and sat under running water for about an hour. 

&#x200B;

I don't feel sick or anything now but i'm scared to tell my mum that I drank bleach so I don't really know what to do and i read an article  about how someone drank a tub of bleach and died a few days later; I only took a sip though, I hope nothing happens."
1,"Is anyone else sad for all the time they spent before they found out about their depression and got help for it?. In high school, everyone told me that when you turned 18 you had to go be independent and self sufficient. My first year of college went ok. But the second year, I became profoundly depressed. I stopped going to classes and my grades suffered. I thought at the time maybe that I was just gaming the system by skipping class because you can skip class in college with fewer consequences. But what was really going on was that I was depressed and I spent all this time on Facebook or just staring at my wall and listening to music, feeling sorry for myself. But I never wanted help because I never wanted to look weak. And I never realized there was a problem with an expectation that you avoid looking weak at all costs. That was an undeniable fact life had taught me (so I thought). I didn't realize I was still affected by my childhood trauma. I didn't talk to anyone. I spent years like that, trying to work and study and always being fucked over by depression/trauma, and failing to recognize it as such. I thought I was just worthless, unable to work hard because of some internal defect. I remember scouring the DMV thinking I had to have some personality disorder. I became obsessed with introversion and the MBTI because I then thought ""oh I can't do the shit I need to do because I'm an INTP trapped in an extrovert feeler world"". I kept deluding myself by following every failure with an ""it must be because I'm too smart for everything"" pep talk. My life is not a bed of roses now, but at least I acknowledged I needed help for depression and PTSD, and got it. 

Anyway, TL;DR is that I spent over a decade in denial of my trauma and depression."
1,"Regret of something i did as a teen need advice/help. When I was younger I have faint memories of being abused which caused me to become hyper sexual at a young age. I seemed to have blurred the lines of right and wrong and made excuses for people I cared about.

Sex was not talked about to me ever at all in my family. I was an awkward shy kid full of shame and highly sensitive/insecure. I found porn on a TV I had and porn in my dads room. It haunted me at first and then I got curious and would look at it sometimes. Cut to my teens when puberty hit for me (F)(I was a late bloomer 14/15) and my sexual urges became heightened. I was confused cause noone talked about it with me. Fast forward one day my dog sniffed my private while I was changing and I thought ""i wonder what oral would feel like” cause i saw it in porn and i thought other kids my age were trying it whilst also copying porn. I put something over my underwear for her to lick off and I remember thinking i was only going to do it for a second but it lasted longer. After i felt weird and dirty but brushed it off. About a year later I eventually told my mom bc the guilt was eating me alive. And now it's coming back again years later. I feel paralyzed with guilt and shame. I feel like I destroyed my life. idk how to move on. Is there a way? I feel so alone but also deserving. I'd never physically hurt a person or animal and it makes me feel like shit that I thought that was ok at the time.  I've prayed to god for forgiveness every time I think about it and will be for the rest of my life but I don't feel forgiven bc I can't seem to forgive myself. Quite frankly it makes me feel like i was like an abuser/predator and my mind connects with awful criminal type people. I want to feel like a good person again but my thoughts want me to punish myself but i can't bc i love my family and they hate seeing me in bed 247.  

Has anyone else overcome/done something like this? Is this a common adolescent thing? I feel extremely embarrassed and alone about this please help"
1,"The birth control pills are deteriorating my mental health at a lightening speed. It’s the second week of taking BC, and these couple days have been feeling like hell. Today is the worst. My original plan was to go to the grocery store and home workout, the usual quarantine routine. However, I feel exhausted and lightheaded. I thought I just didn’t have enough sleep, but a 2-hour nap didn’t help at all. 

My emotion is probably hitting the lowest at all time. I’m easily triggered by little things, which lead to me sobbing uncontrollably for a couple times today. I’ve talked to a couple of close friends and family about the side effects of the pills, but I didn’t mention how much of a disaster it costs to mental health, as an attempt to try to keep my sanity, but I know I’m only barely holding onto it. Even though I enjoy living alone, the loneliness and daily isolation even made it worse on all kind of level. I’m not sure what is my next step, either to inform my gyno or go to therapy."
1,"Lost my job and too depressed to do anything about it.. I don't have a job anymore and I'm too depressed to try to find another one (if there are any).  I just stay at home hating myself. I stopped eating, stopped washing myself, and I almost don't sleep anymore. I wish I had the strenght to get my shit together and find a solution, but I can't. After all, like people on reddit have told me countless times, I'm just a ""whiny littlr bitch""."
1,"I can’t handle isolation/distancing anymore.. I’ve never felt so lonely in my life, and I’m lonely at baseline. This is getting to be too much. I sit in bed all day, not being able to get a handle on my binge eating disorder. What else would I do? I’m empty. This has been the worst I’ve ever felt with my depression. I understand what’s healthy for you and what’s not. I’ve tried sitting out in fresh air with a cup of tea but the sinking numb feeling was still overwhelmingly there. I tried to go on walks and runs but I just want to go back home the entire time. I stare at these walls all day. I text people who don’t text me first but honestly I don’t care, not seeing people in person is getting stale. I need human interaction. I’m an “essential worker” or whatever as a nurse but I’m a new nurse so this shit is really stressful and hard. My preceptor tears me apart. So the time I should be using to relax and recuperate is filled with staring at walls, being alone. I’ve never felt so off the handles in my life. I’ve turned to wine because it makes me feel normal, but I have a family history of addiction. So I’ve had to tell myself no a few times. Feels like my life is going absolutely no where. Maybe it is going no where. I just need this to be over so maybe I can see that one friend that hangs out with me. I’m going insane."
1,"Can anyone else not really sleep during a really bad depressive episode?. Sometimes I can’t sleep at all during a bad depressive episode. Like I’m talking days, it’s like I’ll close my eyes and instead of sleep it’s just this endless buzz in my head of everything that is wrong with me and my surroundings. I’m plagued by exhaustion, yet cannont sleep and instead lie awake in a negative thought loop. Unable to move, unable to distract myself, or sleep. I just lay there, unnervingly trapped by my own my mind. Listening to every thought that pops up.  This can last for days. Is anyone else plagued by this nasty insomnia?"
1,"Feeling useless and worthless. Can’t do anything whatsoever, can’t even get out of bed hardly. I’m the odd one out in my family. Do nothing all day long. Too sad and depressed to do anything. Think about suicide a lot. It’s been like this for too long and don’t know what the hell I can do."
1,"Online Classes are killing me. I am so tired and so depressed, but my anxiety always makes me complete my work last minute. I am so stressed out and I feel like I am on the verge of a mental breakdown. I hate it, but there is nothing I can do.  I just keep doing my work and wishing I was dead and being terrified of getting bad grades. I hate this. Fuck this virus. It has literally made my mental illnesses 10x worse and there is nothing I can do."
1,"I dont know. Every time when I ask myself ""why are you depressed?"" my answer is always I dont know or a spiral of self hate and things not working out, which is normal, its part of life. I dont know, I'm just weak and I'm a coward. Do I even know what depression is? what it means to be depressed? I dont know. Why do I find it so difficult to effectively convey my feelings to myself nevermind to anyone else. I dont know. I just don't know anymore. My life is fine. I just don't know why I'm like this. I dont understand myself and I wish I did, but unfortunately, a guide book for my mind doesn't exist. And it's like I like being depressed, its almost as in I put myself in this mindset intentionally, which sounds quite crazy and sadistic. I like the pain, I like feeling worthless and a failure. But then, I dont like feeling like this and just want to be okay again, normal i guess. Ah I dont know. Whenever I feel like this, I just tell myself to ""firm it and keep moving"", it's the only thing I can do. But, I dont even know how long i can firm it until I'm at a point of no return. I dont know."
1,"I hate the unknown. It sucks. It sucks monkey balls. It sucks so much, that it feels like I'm suffocating.
Being useless all your life and Everytime you do something, big or small it feels like ""is it worth it? Will it work? Will it make a change?"" Enough doubt and fear just takes over of you aren't good enough, nobody is REALLY going to help you. Nobody cares, so why even try? 
If I really reach out for help in something not for me, will people even read it and help so I don't bare the blunt of guilt when it all goes wrong? 

Sorry guys just wanted to vent here a bit. I will delete this later."
1,Someone close to me tried to get me to open up... in the wrong way :/. I was venting a little and this person said ‘So why don’t you kill yourself / Didn’t kill yourself when you felt depressed?’ I know it wasn’t meant  like in a bad way but I just feel like it was really inappropriate to ask me that. Am i overthinking this? as this is always stuck in my mind now
1,"I've found out just how hollow I am.. I've kept two ""friends"" around after finding out that both of em talk shit about each other behind their backs. They said plenty about me too. I kept them around because I found it so funny that they'd constantly lie to my face. Had enough and cut them both off yesterday after threatening them. I don't know what came into me I guess  I was just so enraged that they lied to my face. 

They tried getting back to normal with me by telling me that I got the wrong guy before I cut them off. They got upset that I threatened them and started yelling at me. I told him to stop the tough talk and roll up on me cause they know where I live. It was going to be a knife fight. I grabbed my blade, my mask, and my hoodie and waited....and waited. They never showed up after the tough talk. 

I was really ready to die. All I could think was, kill. It seemed so unlike me, I didn't know who I was in that moment. I've thought of buying a pistol and rolling up on em but once I calmed down I realized this isn't worth it and left it as it was. I'm so empty I only have two emotions. Numb or enraged. If I don't control myself I'm going to end up dead or worse, in prison. 

My depression is the angry type. I never thought it would get this bad to where I'd literally flirt with danger. 

I just needed somewhere to put this. Thank you for reading if you did. Otherwise -

TLDR: Kept fake friends around to learn how to see through them. They lied to my face, I got enraged, invited them to a knife fight. Came to the conclusion I need to get help."

1,"It's 3 in the morning. Last month I lost my sister in a car accident. We had a bond which was tighter than the one I have with my parents. I'm not able to sleep at night. I actually fear going to sleep (dark thoughts come across my mind). 

I miss here so so terribly. She was young just 24. The achiever within the family while I still struggle in college. It should have been me. I try to be brave for my parents. But they too are too broken to recover. It's too much. 

I can't go on. I don't see it ever getting better.
It's just too much. Too much... 

It's 3 in the morning.
And the demons have returned.
In my mind I hear a warning.
But it is too late to run.

I want to scream and thrash.
But I'm tied me to the bed.
A tear rolls down my cheek.
Signaling my spirit to be dead.

A calmness comes over me.
I find comfort in the inevitable.
But then images of my family float.
And thus starts the trouble.

I'm at crossroads, not sure what to do.
Had you been here, I wouldn't be feeling so blue.

I make up my mind.
Far too long have I suffered.
Over the table lies the tiny escape.
It will be quick, it will be painless.
I say as my heart starts to flutter.

I close my eyes, letting the deed take it's course.
There's no turning back I say.
It's time to jump across.

It's 3 in the morning
Finally will I sleep
And when I meet you in the light,
shall I smile and weep"
1,"quarantine is killing me. i feel like whenever i talk to somebody i make them feel bad bcs they know im bad, they try to make me realize that im in a bad mentality, and i end up screwing up everything and asking them to leave me alone in here, in my bad mentality, my even suicidal mentality these days
i asked my few friends to only text me if the conversation will end up with me being better but they dont care and we almost everytime end arguing bout shit that only makes me feel worse
also, i feel pressured with the tasks from school bcs i know that my future is the one that will end up fucked if i dont do them but in my home there's only 1 computer for me, my mother, whose work is in the air at the moment, and my brother
i dont know what to do, i feel worse and worse, more distanced with people that wasnt distanced with me when this shit started
im from Spain, i probably wrote something wrong gramatically or idk
i just want this shit to end, i had a weak mindset before this and this just made it even weaker

as i said, English isn't my first language so sorry if something is wrong"
1,"Isolation is killing me. This stupid virus has done too much damage already. I want it to be over.

I went from paranoid delusions, fearing the end of the world, to this fucking depression. I feel nothing but isolation. Contact with my friends no longer helps, because we are not face to face. I find that I draw my happiness from contact with others. Being without my friends has sucked the life out of me. My soul hurts. I spend more of my day sleeping and moping around instead of doing things I enjoy. When I try to do things I enjoy, I cannot stay focused. Instead, I keep focusing on how alone I am.

I spent the better part of the evening staring at my razor blade and thinking about what my death would feel like. What would it feel like to watch my life bleed out of me? Would it hurt? Would it be fast? Would my friends miss me? Would they even get to have a funeral? How would my wife feel? How would my family be impacted?

Why do I feel like this? Why can't I just be normal? I want to stop hurting."
1,Always angry. I’m always angry. Even when I’m happy deep down there is this burning anger inside of me. I can mostly control it but every few years that fire burns too much for me to handle. When that happens people around me get hurt. I’ve been to therapy but that never helped. All therapy does is teach you how to bury that anger. It never teaches you how to control it. That I learned myself. I learned to focus that in things like the gym or in arguments. I occasionally use it to hurt people that deserve it. But recently I’ve stopped going to the gym because of my depression. And due to the corona virus there’s no ways for me to use my anger productivity. I can feel the flame getting bigger and I know sooner or later it’s going to take over Andy family are going to be the ones who get burned. I need this lockdown to be over for their sake.
1,"What led you to the hospital?. What events triggered your depression early in your life? What triggers it now? What prevented you from seeking help before? What difficulties do you have with practicing your coping skills? Can you identify your mood and activities throughout the day? What pleasant activities do you do in order to cope? What events led you to the hospital? 

Im trying to help my therapist understand me better but I dont understand a lot about myself."
1,"is it normal to hide your depression from everyone?. i’ve been depressed for about 1,5 years now, possibly more. besides the counselor i was talking to last year i haven’t told anyone definitively that i’m depressed. in fact i go to great lengths to convince people around me the opposite, that i’m happy. i think some of the closest people know i’m struggling, but i’ve never talked about it.

the reason is that i’m ashamed to feel like this. i’m afraid that word gets around that “OP is depressed” and so on. i basically fear being judged, but also that i will be treated with pity."

I don't know...

I don't know. Sometimes I know and other times I'm not really sure. Is this whole thing just fake? Did my brain create this story for me to believe so that I can feel some sense of certainty, or that I can feel that I'm 'special' and people should pity me? Do I cut only so I can think ""only someone with depression would hurt themselves on purpose, right? So I must have depression, right? Right?"". is it lying to me, like everyone says it does? Sometimes I'm happy, briefly, and then it reminds me of everything and my smile fades. No one notices, though. But those were genuine smiles. So I can't have depression if im smiling, right? If I felt happiness? Oh, someone did notice. They asked me if I was sad, and trapped and scared in the moment, I said ""no one will ever know..?"" stupid. Fucking stupid. I didn't want to lie but I couldn't say the truth. I'm such an idiot. That's literally such a stupid thing to say. And then my dad noticed. Trapped me in my room and asked if I was OK. I said ""yeah, I'm fine, I'm always like this."" so stupid. But I didn't know if I have depression, so what if it turned out that I didn't and people laughed at me and judged me and called me a crybaby and a wimp behind my back? I'm only 13, so I have nothing to worry about right? Nothing to be sad about? It would destroy me. Because it's true. And that's what hurts. I don't know who I am, what I'm supposed to do. Just school, and feeling nothing. Wake up, stress. Go to bed, emptyness. No emotion. Just stress. Brief happiness. Sadness. Self-hatred. The feeling of being lost. I want to cry but if I do people will hear me. Fuck. I'm a wimp. A loser. No one actually likes me, how could they? WHY would they? So many questions. No answer. I'll never get answers. It'll constantly be this feeling of being trapped. A cycle. No motivation, but I have to act OK, otherwise they'll give me that piteous look and ask me questions I don't want to answer. Because if I don't have depression, they'll hate me and say I just want attention. They'll hate me more than they already do. But I laugh, so I'm okay. Right?

I... I don't know.

If you got this far... Thanks. It really means a lot to me."
1,"What makes your mood go from perfect to absolute shit in a split second?. Personally for me, my mood completely changes to me being sad and on the verge of tears whenever i see or hear mostly anything related to relationships and dating."
1,Anyone?. Does anyone else’s family taunt and bully you about your depression and self harm
1,Hate when people ask if I’m ok. Why do I get embarrassed/defensive when people notice I’m struggling or ask if I’m okay even though I Lowkey want them to notice? Ugh it’s so weird
1,Tired of this world. People are dying everyday and it could have been prevented. People think it’s a conspiracy. It’s not as bad as pneumonia they say. All you need to take are vitamins. I’m constantly surrounded by ignorant selfish people who parrot what the news tells them. There is no convincing them otherwise. They think this is all fake. They vote against their own interests. They are making the world worse. I’m tired of people being this dumb and selfish. I wish I wasn’t around any more. I believe in God but I can’t understand why this needed to happen. I cant believe what is happening everyday. I can’t believe how shitty people are. I wish everyone could just wake up. I just can’t deal with this anymore.
1,"It DOES get better... but then it gets even worse.. Life is a cycle. You have a good day after a myriad of bad ones or vice versa. Just logically, it does get better. But, with the same logic, it gets worse.

Happiness is not eternal. Neither is sadness. Life is living with the constant cycle of good to bad and bad to good. 

So then, is life worth living just for the good ones?

I don't know."
1,"Below Rock Bottom. This is a bit of a rant so I’m sorry in advance.

Since January I’ve been at the lowest point(s) of my life. I felt so empty and lifeless that I placed an expiration date for myself, on March 15th if things in my life hadn’t gotten better I would have killed myself by jumping off of a bridge a few towns over. Things got marginally better and I didn’t have the inclination to go through it on march 15th, but two weeks prior to that date I slipped mentally and tried to sufficate myself in my bathroom. I think I knew it wouldn’t work but I was hoping it would. To me that was **ROCK BOTTOM** and I’ve been doing so poorly since then. Between then and the date I orginally chose to kill myself, I picked up vaping nicotine to deal with the feeling of unworthiness. The date approaching was traumatic and so was already having attempted to kill myself. Shortly after, and having quit vaping, I was forced to move back home from college. At this point I feel like I’m below rock bottom. I am beyond depressed. I can’t feel happy which probably is depression BUT I can’t feel sadness either, it’s like i’ve been devoid of emotion which is extremely unsettling and concerning."
1,"#lost. I feel like I'm fighting myself and loosing. My head is just above the surface but I've essentially been drowning for years now. And no one gets it seriously, and even if someone did, I know no one can help.  I've been up and down but the main thing that has happened trough these years of sadness and self doubt is the fact I've slowly been disappearing. And not so much in other peoples lives, altho that too, but in my own mind. I remember less, feel less, know less, am myself less, have less hope,  zero will and energy. I feel hopeless, and not even in the same cliche way that everyone around me seems to see, but in my core. I hate it. I've come to truly discus myself. Bit of background, I am a 24 year old girl (altho i don't feel like much of anything). I graduated graphic design in 2018. I have a messy but loving family, a home. Finally I think I found a decent guy that loves me, as oppose to a sea full of assholes I've been with so far. As a little kid I was pretty shy, and a smartass, which as you can assume lead to a fair amount of bullying. I rarely had real friends. We moved a lot. So I assume it makes sense I was an introverted kid, alone, in the books etc. But I grew up thinking I had it, the courage to shrug shit off, the brain to see above and beyond the little petty world I lived in, and big brave heart ful of love and dreams, sure I was gonna grow out of the shit and show everyone I was actually great, and just rock on. Reality is, that kid in me feels so disappointed, it gets hard to breathe let alone stop myself from crying. And my mind just keeps on rambling and going over and over the same shit, while I slowly lose every pixel of what I wished I was."
1,"Got rejected by all universities and scholarships, feeling absolutely worthless. Hey there, everyone. This will be a slightly long post, so I will understand if you do not read all the way through. 

I am an international student who has previously applied to the United States for further education, along with scholarships in my home country. The results were abysmal - I got rejected from 6 out of the 8 universities which I applied to, had to rescind one offer because I couldn't supply my finances in time and got accepted into one. I've had no luck on the scholarship front either. 

I've not been taking this news well at all. I was really harbouring great dreams to go to the US to study music, and it feels like my dreams have all been smashed. I genuinely thought I had a chance of getting in to the schools I wanted, but now it feels like reality has delivered the verdict, and the truth of it is I simply haven't accomplished as much with my life as I thought I did. It feels like all I've done has amounted to nothing. 

A good majority of my close friends did manage to get into reputable overseas universities, and I can't help feeling left out and utterly inferior to them. I can't socialise with other people now without constantly being reminded of my own inability to achieve things. They say that to be successful you ought to surround yourself with successful people to learn from them, but all I feel is inadequacy. 

I've also felt that my learning capabilities have become compromised. Now I feel either cynical, impatient or resigned while learning. I have no mood to learn new things and I can't help getting a feeling of, ""my time has passed, I should have done all these things during childhood,"" when picking up new skills. I get really impatient now and constantly expect quick results, which usually don't happen and end up making me even more frustrated. 

I've had depressive episodes before, but last year was really a hopeful and inspiring one because I was stepping out of my comfort zone and I was really trying to take life in new directions I hadn't gone to before. 2020 is turning out to be the antithesis of that - getting rejected feels like all I'm doing has come to naught and everything I've tried to build has been a lie. I'm sinking into a slump where every day just passes by in a blur and I don't know how to shake it off. 

This is just a bad year all-round. I'm aware that all of this has sounded like self-absorbed narcissistic whining, but I wanted to get it off my chest regardless. Thanks everyone if you've read this far, and I hope that all of you are coping well with the coronavirus quarantine yourselves."
1,"Life is getting harder and harder each day that goes on.. I don't even know where to start to be honest. I wan't to visit someone for help whether it be a doctor to inject me with momentary happiness that I need to restock, or someone to talk to on a regular basis. Life is getting rough though. And I am not talking about the whole Covid-19 situation as it does not phase me, my lifestyle, nor my employment. Rather life's toll has become every increasing. I play songs at night and they keep me awake in a pool of tears for various reasons. I find a new song an within a week it will make me burst out in tears. I've lost all enjoyment from my passion. I miss my childhood most of all and wish I could reset my life. Start over and correct my screw ups. I know it's not possible. I've spent nights praying to gods I don't believe in for any kind of escape. Begging to make a deal with the devil for a window of escape, but to no avail. The color of the world has started to fade. Every day I miss work more and more. I go on a week long binge of skipping work because I cant bear to get out of bed. I'd rather sit and do nothing. Trash piling up around me. I can't listen to music anymore without getting emotional and watching videos or playing games feels bland and boring. I try to sing, write, draw, anything. Nothing makes me feel anything. I started drinking more and more, but it's just blurring everything together. I don't know where I am going with this, but I feel lonely, afraid, and like I am slowly losing touch with reality."

1,"Happy pain, I guess. TL;DR at the end

I just did both the worst and best thing I have done in a long time. 10 months ago I met a girl. I uave never had a better relationship with anyone ever. We never dated, we were just good friends. However, I did develop feelings for her, in fact, she is the first person I've ever been in love with. I had a girlfriend when we met. I decided to dump her to be with this girl. I never shoot my shot because I was too scared to do so and, well, we never became anything more than good friends. 5 months ago she started dating someone. Every other night I've been crying myself to sleep since then. I never stop thinking about her and I tried my best so we wouldn't drift off and stay as friends. Nothing I did worked, and we ended up hardly ever talking, only when she felt like shit. I tried to kill myself again month ago and she called me up. I told her how I felt and she pretty much told me to stop being a dumbass. Today I told her that it would be better if we never talked again, and even after being taken off my meds by my psychiatrist and not needing therapy anymore due to being well, I have not felt this shit in months, yet I know this is better for me

TL;DR I was in love with a girl, we drifted apart, tried my best to save the relationship, still fucked it up, told her we shouldn't speak anymore, and even though it hurts like hell, I know it's better for me"

Out of this hellhole. If I didn’t have a best friend to disappoint, then I’d be gone. I want to be enough, but you always see more."
1,"I want to end it. I don't have any desire to live. I wish I could just leave and disappear from everything, everyone, all my problems. It would be perfect. I want an escape. As much as this concept is desirable I know it won't actually save me because I'll always have my mind and in a matter of time I would start reciting the same thoughts of feeling trapped with nothing to live for. There's no escape for me. I'm lost, I have no desire to think about my future but the pressure from my family and everyone around me becomes too much. Maybe I'm naive but all I want in my life is freedom and my happiness, however I don't think I'll be able to achieve either. I will never be free from my mind. The only way out for me is death, perhaps not perfect it's either that or live a miserable life."

For a while I thought I was handling my depression pretty well and that I was on the road to getting better, but this covid lockdown just destroyed all of that. I feel absolutely hopeless, panicked, and I dont feel like doing anything at all. I cant make myself do my school work or hardly get out of bed. I just dont find any motivation or reason to do anything anymore. I don't have any distractions like school or trips to the record store, online school is absolutely horrible and stressful due to the pressure and my trouble with understanding without hands on help, I feel more alone than I ever have, I cant do a single thing without my stepdad screaming at me for no reason. I cant even go on walks to get excercise because of the shitty neighborhood I live in but all the gyms are closed. All I'm doing is rotting in front of a screen and eating like shit. I just want things to go back to normal so I can distract myself again. No one knows when this quarentine will be over and that's the worst part. I'm not sure if I can take any more of this. I don't even know what my career future will be. I was going to go into the medical field but now I'm rethinking it. I just dont really know why I'm here or where I'm going anymore.

The perceived shortfalls, possessions, feelings, importance.

Why me? What makes me so special?

All of existence and it's about me.

Ego?

No, not me. Way better than that.

Low self esteem.

I'm grounded.

Here on the ground. Where I'm should be.

My choices:

Appreciate the experiences

or experience the misery.

I'm incapable of being satisfied with my current life. It's not possible.

I must reach my destination.

I won't accept anything less.

1,"Experience with anti depressants?. I know they would affect everyone differently, but I’d like to know if it’s worth going on them. I already see a therapist for my anxiety, but I didn’t tell her exactly how depressed I feel (because of the anxiety). 

I don’t know if she would be the right person to talk to about taking anti depressants or a doctor. I’m on the pill, I don’t really get side effects from that (I think) I have noticed some very small things but I’ve been on it for so many years that I don’t know if it’s side effects or just life in general.

Is anyone able to share their experiences with me?"
1,Finding happiness in pets. Has anyone ever bought a pet so they could have a companion that offers unconditional love and to essentially be their rock? What with quarantine restrictions and all I feel like now is as good of a rine as any to get a pet (while I'm home full time for a few months) so I can spend the early part of their life with them every day. I absolutely love dogs but feel like that's a bit of a big responsibility to take on considering the training it needs and the fact that I live in an apartment. Any cat lovers out there feel like their cat is their bestfriend and saves them on their down days?

1,"I might just end it now because I am pathetic.. I am living in another country due to my master's degree. I don't want to go back to my country. I landed an internship at a really good company and it was about to convert into a full-time job but due to Covid-19, they told me they can't hire me right now so maybe after this situation settles down. I know for the fact that they will forget about me and the coronavirus situation will go on for a couple more months, I assume. The internship, itself was very hard to get and now all my efforts went down the drain. It's so hard for me to find a job here as to where I live there are less English speaking jobs and my level of the language of this country is basic. I enrolled in the language classes but due to odd jobs and internships, I couldn't complete them.  

I feel like I am pathetic that I cannot get a job. I am a master's student and wasted all my parents' money. Due to quarantine, I can't help but feel even more helpless than ever. I get panic attacks and thoughts of ending it all. My parents have told me already to come back as they can't keep on giving me money. I feel like that I have tried my best and I can't do more than this. I want and need to see a therapist but I was waiting to get a job and then go as I don't have money. I can't even make myself get better. I feel too much or sometimes nothing at all. I know these times have been hard for everyone and I'm not special but I know there's nothing for me even when the virus situation gets better. I hate money and the ones who say that money can't bring you happiness haven't lived a hard or a hungry day in their life."

And I don’t care if it hurts."
1,"The universe is against me.. I feel that the universe is against me getting well.  The past 2 years have been hell.  I started into a downward spiral that i couldn't control.  I took an attempt on my life and was hospitalized.  
After starting meds again it took almost a year to get on the upswing again but the side effects took a toll on me. I stayed on the meds until i had a good grasp on my sanity again and went off of them feeling happy. (September)

Now I've never really wanted to have kids (I'm child free) and within weeks of being off of medication I got pregnant at 38. (October). 

I still didn't want to have a child into this mess of my life.  I had an abortion as soon as i could. Because I got it so quickly, i wasn't able to speak to the doctor between having my ultrasound (to confirm how far i was into pregnancy) and the procedure day.  On the day of the procedure (November) i found out i had another large cyst on my ovary. I have had them surgically removed years ago, multiple times.  The cyst was too large to ignore it and the procedure i was having wasn't going to fix it. I had to schedule another surgery appointment for the new year.  

Had the cyst removed and got my tubes tied. (January). The recovery from surgery was 4-6 weeks.  I don't heal quickly so it took me about 8 weeks to feel fully healed.  During my recovery i thought it would be good for me to take a trip.  I love to travel and hadn't done any big trips in 3 years.  Traveling far away from my problems is an empowering thing for me so i booked a trip through Italy (February). 

 I was to leave on March 4th. I got a common flu days before i was to depart anyway so I'm glad i didn't go now as my flight home from Milan was cancelled. (March) The world went into lockdown mode, everyone has to stay home.  I need to get away.  

I find some reprieve when i go to work (gas/oil sector) so i guess that's a plus.  I'm still working my usual shifts (days and nights). i can't help but feel that  everything is working against my getting fully well again.  

I'm struggling right now.  I would normally just write all of this in my journal but i can't seem to find it.  I had an anxiety attack when i couldn't find it so i posted here.

My flat-share left, leaving me with all the bills (it's only my name on the lease) and I can't even work because of quarantine.

1,"Unemployed for 2 years, A Certified teacher, want to come back to living a full life. Advice needed. Is there hope for me?. I'm a 30-year-old man with a B.A. in education and teaching, my major is citizenship and sociology. I graduated from Uni at the top of my class, two years ago and had a promising future. But my life got messy as soon as I graduated; From a successful, sociable person, a person whom people cherish and appreciate and love, I've become different at 180 degrees.

1. My mom got sick, was hospitalized for two months and I moved to here home to help her. Than she moved back and I needed to stay for another couple of months until the goverment gave her someone to care of her.
2. I was diagnosed with chronic depression (my problem is not the diagnosis but the consequences of it: now my medical records are stained and I will probably not be able to get private medical insurance, take a mortgage and buy a home and have to declare in any workplace that requires a medical confidentiality waiver that I have depression) .
3. I made a mistake and admited to psycaetrist that I smoked cannabis and other things a few years ago and now its registered fact at my medical record. And now i'm afraid that i will have to addmit it to insurance companies and employers for the rest of my life.
4. I thought I took a short break to help my mom and she recovered but I got lost.

I had a very promising future, a bachelor's degree, honors, volunteerism, a good past, I had the qualities of a leader, and I could live a good, good life. I come from a very poor family and I was hoping I could get out of poverty. I am afraid of my future, my parents will have nothing to bequeath to me, my parents live on rent and I am afraid that if my life goes on I will be an aging homeless and without a wife and children and I am anxious for the future.

 All my life, I took care of myself and built myself without the help of anyone. With money no one could help me or help me, only I promoted myself and was proud of myself for it.

I already want to find a job and develop a career, but I am ashamed of my last two years. How do I explain that I did not work and was unemployed for 2 years! Whole 24 months? How do I protect myself? I'm very worried because I don't think any self-respecting institution will take a 30-year-old who hasn't worked for two years? I would be happy to advise."

I'm just a ball of hate, frustrated of everything because I hate my life and myself, , I hate being like that but this is anorched deep within me and I feel like I can't change, I had some friends (not a lot...) when I was in High school, but I just kept a few of them, and now I'm at university, I'm 20 and I can't really make new friends, I guess it's because I'm too toxic, I'm a loner so I wouldn't probably go out with them but just knowing that some people like me would give me a little bit of self-confidence, but I guess I'm too bad of a person to have friends which is the main problem here.

1,"The people I can't find. The bar is buzzing. Camera flashes are bouncing off the bottles behind the bar. A stack of speakers are shaking with the sonic treats of the top billboard hits. The stool under men feels like it was sharpened by Vlad.

A pretty girl is chirping from the stool next to me while flipping her hair between her fingers, but I can only watch the door to the bar. Somewhere out there is some one worth talking to. Whoever it is, they sure as hell aren't in this place. They aren't dancing on the hardwood floor. They aren't throwing back mixed drinks, trying to recapture the carefree moments of youth. They are out there, somewhere. Doing what? I wish I knew.

I stand. I leave the bar. The warmth of my bar stool made evident by the cool air now making me overly aware of my own backside. I dust myself off. How long was I sitting in that bar. It doesn't matter. I'm out. I'm walking. I'm searching the night. I knew I couldn't stay with those people, nice as they were. I have to find my own kind. The people that wake at night."
1,"I need help y'all.  I don't wanna live anymore,:don't have any friend, been bullied my whole life in every school, and by my own parents. I'm so anxious and deeply depressed that I'm afraid to go out of my room and I have problems with my memory and learning. I can't fix my life. What is the the least painful way of committing suicide?"
1,"Anyone notice the good things in their life happen too late. Like I’ve been trying like hell to finalize this place to live for the last month. I was going to move in with my girlfriend as we were getting back together. Except she left me last week. 

Now I get news today I got the place but who gives a fuck? Where were you last week when the stress of everything took it’s tole and ruined the relationship?"
1,"Is shooting yourself in the head just the ultimate method of suicide?. I don't think any other method holds the same reliability,  ease and speed of a gunshot to the head.

Sure it can go wrong, but so can the other ways and none are as simple as just pulling your finger a little.

Hanging is so gruesome and doesn't look quick, and what if you get it wrong? The beam the rope is attached to snaps? So embarrassing"
1,"Am I just self diagnosing?. Hello.

I've noticed a lot of differences between 15 year old me & 19 year old me. I know as we grow up our perceptions, views & thoughts also tend to change, but I don't think mine falls into that category of 'change'.

 When I was younger, I was very ambitious, confident, determined & I knew what I wanted. Now, it's the exact opposite. I don't want to do anything, I don't have any interests and I can't help but think how meaningless life is & how much I hate being the person I am. I just feel like I don't deserve the life I have, it's too good for someone like me to live it. I always feel like a burden to people & I feel like everyone hates me (not that anyone ever said anything). I feel like they just treat me well because they're stuck with me & there's nothing they can do about it.


My brother had studied psychiatry & he was the one whom I could talk to openly. However, he told me not to label myself under those big words. So I have stopped talking to him about it.


 A day won't pass without thinking about death & how everything would've been better if I had never existed. I used to beat myself up, but I have stopped cause my body is now used to the pain. Also, I can't feel sympathy nor empathy anymore. I don't miss anyone, I don't love any one, the only emotions I feel are anger & disappointment. So it's hard for me to connect with people & I'm very isolated, like I get introvertion but mine has passed the line, I couldn't even attend my brother's wedding cause I was afraid to do something stupid & embarrass him & afraid of people judging me. On top of that, whenever I feel a tiny bit happy I feel guilty cause I feel like a loser like me doesn't deserve to be happy. 


So please let me know if there's something wrong with me or I'm fine & just making this up. Cause I genuinely can't tell if this is really happening to me or it's all in my head. Is this normal or I'm just overreacting?"
1,"""WARNING"" Novel of doom ahead. Finding me!. Since birth i was given away, the only girl to my mother. She kept my brothers. I was raised with different types of people, family, to strangers & even friends. It was horrible! My upbringing was AWFUL, mentally, emotionally, sexual abuse, abused.  Nobody loved me. I ended up with my 1st child @ the age of 16. I didn't know what I was doing, thought I was in love forever, til he cheated on me when our son was 3 months old! I threw him out of my life & moved on to an unstable mother & found another guy to love, I gave birth to our daughter. Her father was crazy, abused me most times well pregnant, ran away from him with my kids @ the age of 17. His family took me to court for my son & our daughter, they spoke lies about me, they wanted me to stay with the crazy son. They found me & my kids were ripped away like a lit match stick! I'm more lost than anything at this point, I'm trying to do right for me but everytime I failed because I didnt care no more. Drinking & smoking weed made me happy, help drown out the pain! 2yrs later I'm 19yrs old, I met a guy who's 16yrs old. I couldn't help but make myself known to his presence @ a course we both attended. We eventually made out & stuck together for 10yrs & in that 10yrs we had 5 kids. My life had changed dramatically from LOST to settled, I gave birth to his 1st child but my 3rd. After hrs in labour, we had him for 30mins till his passing, the most difficult part of my life. Losing a child in my opinion is worse than the abuse & rape I've had to endure. A week after his passing, the father had gone back to work, he didnt cry or realize he had gone. 1st day @ work he was hospitalized, fell from a 2 story building shattering his right arm. After all of this, he started to abuse me so bad, I still stayed with him & gave birth to the rest of his 5. He was in & out of jail constantly for abuse, I was having to deal with Child Youth & Families until 1 day they we're uplifted because I let him back into our lives knowing he was abusive & a high risk to almost killing me so many times. I put my kids at risk, even with drinking around them. I've never known what LOVE or how to trust the person you love. I'm very hidden with how I can start something out of nothing, the jealousy towards another female or anyone getting close to the one I love is A NO. My upbringing I blame for that. After them been uplifted in 2014, I'm definitely drowning in SHIT, don't care for nothing or myself. He ends up in jail a few months later, 2yrs he's doing. I'm on the outside waiting for him like a dumb cunt, in 2016 I found someone on facebook. Wasnt looking for love, he was someone that attended the same school as me back when I was 13. We end up talking little bits, he started to get at me on a daily its unbelievable how I'm here 5yrs later with him lol. He's born on the same day as the one in jail, in different years. We're also 3 days apart on our birthdays. He came across as a narcissist, It was unbelievably difficult for me. I found so much connection to this guy, I couldn't let go. He was not my type but the bond was strong. He has a daughter, I've never been in a relationship with a guy who had a child, so it took a toll on me to accept it. The fact I had to make room for someone that he showed a huge amount of love for, made me feel jealous. After spending time with her, I started to accept her more, I actually loved been there for her because I didnt have any of my own kids with me. She gave me hope to motivate myself to see my kids. 3yrs into our relationship we had a son my 8th child! His daughter went to live with her mother, it's best she did, she was depressed with us. I couldn't be that mother figure to her cos she loved her own mother. Today is the 15th of April 2020, my eldest boy will be 18 this month. My 8th child has autism, I'm still with his father. I'm 34 turning 35 in August this year, I'm heavily depressed, never spoke to anyone about my troubled life. Drunk it away, laughed it off & forgave so many that did me wrong. I suffer from anxiety attacks, I feel as if I'm slowly dying. I'm too young to die & I have so many things I want to do as a individual women, I'm highly motivated but I know my partner will feel insecure about me wanting to get out there on social media. I gave up smoking in October 2019, never have I quit smoking before thanks to my major ANXIETY ATTACK! I've also cut back on drinking, thanks to my trip to the hospital with a liver issue. Now I'm plain, with so many things I want to do. I have low self esteem due to weight gain, my confidence has stepped up to 60% my inside though feels tired, for years I lost my purpose & myself. These last few months I've been searching for me, I've found bits & pieces. I don't want to waste anymore of my life doing what others want of me or giving others what I think they want! I get to see all my children (heart is relieved) reducing stress. Lazy, which is a good thing, I suffered & still suffer from OCD. I have major health issues but tests say I'm healthy. It could be my mind overthinking. I'm praying someone or anyone could talk to me & tell me it's ok. I often think of the homeless & all those suffering in other countries that are asking for miracles. If I had any kind of high power, I'd definitely do my best to save as many as I can. Its who I am as a person, caring for others even if they committed a crime I can't hate. I pretend to be tough out there but hurting any living thing breaks my heart. I hate that I can't hate the people who raped me, it makes me hate myself so much. I'm a follower but I know deep down i can be a good leader, if I found who I am. Thanks for letting me share my NOVEL of doom. Never shared a briefing of my life before with strangers! Oh well I feel it may help since I couldn't speak to a counselor due to my anxiety attacks."
1,"My dog died yesterday and I feel like a part of me died with her. So I live away from my parents and I didn’t get to say goodbye to my dog. I was hoping to see her this summer.

Right now I feel like a shell of a person. I don’t feel human. I feel numb. I feel empty. I feel like I’ll never be happy again, and that nothing will ever make me happy. I feel like nothing that used to make me happy or content, like friends, food, books, movies, video games, etc, whatever it is, could ever make me feel whole again. I used to love baking and cooking and eating, but now I have no interest. And I can’t be with friends now because of Covid. I live alone. 

I’ve talked to my family over the phone about our loss, but that won’t bring her back. Me eating a lovely piece of chocolate won’t bring her back. 

I want her back. I want her young and healthy again. I want to tell her that I love her. I want to see her running around joyfully. That’s the only thing I want. Knowing that I’ll never get her back makes me feel devoid of everything except loss.

It hurts. I feel it in my soul. A piece of me is gone forever."
1,It always comes back.... ...just got to sleep it off. Go away in the morning sadness.
1,"I’m fucking sick of everything. Everything I attempt to do, I’m garbage at. Social interaction, trying to play video games, being a productive human, mattering to people, being attractive. Literally anything I try to do for enjoyment I end up being garbage at. I’m just sick of everything and want this all to end"
1,"Why do I act out on social media?. I (24M) have felt the urge to comment on things on social media to get a reaction out of someone, in hopes their reaction releases what’s clogged in my head. I’m not commenting anything mean, I just have the urge to comment on a lot of things. Like if someone posts something that may not make sense to me, I feel like I have to comment. A part of me thinks I’m doing it to prevent myself from going back into my depression. Maybe I don’t know how to let things go, maybe I have nothing going on in my life, maybe I’m just looking for someone to care. I really don’t know. And when I do comment I get anxious and get scared to open the app. But the relief after a sharp reaction from someone eases my brain. Like I can physically feel it. Feels like something has been snapped which then releases a flood of fluid. I also think I’m acting out of fear. But fear of what? Lastly I did start therapy this week."
1,"I’m coming out as depressed??. I posted to my various social media about my depression. For me, this was kind of like a victory letter. It’s me saying that I’m not ashamed of my depression and I’m getting help. I don’t want it to control my life. No matter what is going on, we have to have hope that something better is coming along. Right?

For reference, this is what I posted:


Depression. It’s a bitch. 
It took me to the brink of life and death in 8th grade and now again when I’m 21 years old. It wasn’t supposed to be like this and I felt disappointed in myself for so long for not being able to “fix myself”. For those who have reached out to me, thank you. You may think that saying hi was insignificant, but your notification was literally the only light in my room sometimes. And those who didn’t, how could you have known. I’ve always been ashamed of my depression. I’ve always tried to hide it behind smiles and jokes. It made me feel better momentarily. But I always ended up feeling alone because I had no one that knew the real me. And I’m tired of that. It took a lot of courage saying this, and even more courage to get help. But thanks to the wonderful people supporting me I’m able to stand strong. Starting today, I’m going to be living fully and un-apologetically me. It took me a long way to get here... But I’m happy to say that for once in my life, I’m looking forward to tomorrow."
1,"Trapped. This could be difficult to explain but everytime I get into a spiral of depression my mind makes every day conversation/interaction almost impossible, not through want of not trying but because somehow your brain has completely shut off that ability.

Has anyone experienced this situation where their whole vocabulary is restricted to just a select few words and feel as though their brain has just shut down?
P.s. even when I try and get into a conversation my sentences are muddled (further reinforcing this idea my brain is giving up?)"
1,"I literally can't even tell what's real or fake anymore. I've been abused on and off throughout my life, so gaslighting is nothing new to me. I'm so full of hatred towards myself that when I start talking bad about myself in my head, it's just another person. I call her the bitch in my head because duh. 

I've been trying hard for years to think more positively, like instead of saying ""I want to die"" I'll try to say ""I don't want to die, I just want to stop hurting."" But when the bitch starts saying horrrible things, like ""You're such a terrible person"" I can't say ""no, I'm not a bad person"" because that's exactly what I'd say if I was a bad person. A  bad person would deliberately play up their suffering to make themselves look like an innocent victim so they could do no wrong. What if that's what I'm doing but I'm so good that I even fooled myself to I think I deserve saving? What if I've subconsciously tricked myself into thinking I'm innocent? I can't tell. I don't think I could ever be able to tell.

 For all I know, the bitch in my head is right about everything and I ought to just kill myself to save everyone else from me. But then again thinking I matter enough at all for people to be afraid of me is so arrogant. Who do I think I am? Why would anyone notice me, good or bad? I'm just starting to spiral now into this infinite loop of hate. I really, really don't want to die, but for the love of anything remotely holy, I can't keep living like this.

TLDR: existence is agony"
1,"School is the root of my problems. I didn't realise till now that school was making my depression and anxiety SO much worse. Here's the pattern that made me realise:

School year starts - suddenly I think about suicide every night as I try to sleep

School holidays start - suicidal thoughts become less overwhelming and less frequent

From the FIRST DAY school goes back - intense daily suicidal thoughts return...

I always knew school was having a very bad effect on my mental health, but never put anymore emphasis on it than other things that cause me stress and depression like relationships, the state of the world, etc...

The sad thing is even when I'm not at school and have relaxed thoughts I'm still not happy. There are NO circumstances in life that will bring me happiness.

(First post on reddit btw)"
1,"Wasting resources. So, the reason I’m still alive is because I’m afraid committing will waste all the money and time my parents have spent to raise me. I feel like I can’t leave without fulfilling my obligations to them — but then it’s also terrifying how empty and purposeless I’ll feel when they’re gone.

I’m in college right now, majoring in something that will allow me to pay them back as quickly as possible (they didn’t ask for this; I just feel guilty for wasting their resources...). I’ve been struggling with depression since I was 7. Not sure why I felt like posting this today — it might be a bit of a rant after a couple of meetings where I felt like the dumbest person in the (virtual) room and this overwhelming emptiness that has been building up for a long time. My heart has been hurting since yesterday (it’s the feeling of having a sad, heavy weight on your chest to the point where it’s only slightly more difficult to breathe) and I thought I could sleep it out but I woke up like this too. 

(Internet) hugs for everyone here; I don’t know how I’m going to piece myself back together and get over the “you’re useless and disgusting” feeling but this sub makes me feel less alone. Thank you for letting me vent."
1,"I’m thinking about suicide every day. Hey.  I want to talk a little about my life.  I am 20 years old.  In early childhood, I lost both parents.  The first 9 years of 11 at school I had practically no friends.  I walked alone, chatted with people from other cities on the Internet.  In the last 2 years of school I have changed.  made many friends, had fun with them.  Everything was the same in the first year and a half of the university.  Then bad things happened in my life.  I got depressed.  (I have a confirmed diagnosis).  For about a year I did not go anywhere except study and shop, rarely went for a walk.  I stopped seeing all my friends in real life.  Over the past half year I went to the party 3 times.  I forced myself to go there because I thought it would help me.  During this time, I began to feel worse every day.  It seems to me that people are looking at me because something is wrong with my face.  Every time I meet a girl I like, thoughts arise in my head that I am a jerk, and should not even think about her.  My mind makes me think that I am not worthy to be part of someone's life.  And I believe in it more and more.  I am not trying to find new hobbies for myself, because I am afraid that others will laugh at me.  But the worst thing is that for a long time, I think about suicide every day.  These thoughts arise completely suddenly.  Sometimes it’s enough for me to look at my face in the mirror, and my brain begins to think that such a freak as I am not worthy to even appear in public, and it is better for him to kill himself.  I am very much afraid, because every day these thoughts arise more often, and they are more and more detailed.  The only thing that keeps me here is my relatives.  I'm afraid to go completely crazy.  Now I am very lonely, I have not seen friends for many weeks.  All I dream about is a normal life, like everyone else.  But I feel that I will either commit suicide or die because my body weakens every day.  I don’t have money for a psychologist, and it’s unlikely that they will help me here, but at least I could speak out, and it became a little easier for me.  I have too many mental disorders, but I can’t talk about them in more detail, because the text is so very long.  Thanks if you read this."
1,"I can't bring myself to unsubscribe from wedding subreddits despite my fiancée's death but they are making everything worse.. I was excitedly planning our wedding, that was probably going to be moved back but still going to eventually happened, happily and with great enthusiasm for so long. I was so excited to call her my wife and marry her and just be with her forever, or as long as we could on this Earth. At least a couple of decades... To do this, I would get inspiration from wedding subreddits and share them with her when I saw something she might like. Now that she's passed away, seeing these posts just jab me in my heart. I won't be marrying the love of my life. She's gone. I go to unsubscribe, but then I feel like I'm just giving up on her and what was going to be, and I just can't do it. I miss her so much. My heart is weak and feeble. I feel fragile. I love her. I love her. I love her. I want her back so much. I'd do anything. Is it bad that sometimes I wish I could just join her in death? There's a small chance I'd see her again then..."
1,"i don't think i'm a good person. i don't necessarily think i'm evil either... but i think my overall contribution to the world is negative (or at least not exactly great) i say stupid shit... i know i've hurt people. i've had so many friends that treated me like shit and i'm starting to wonder. am i the issue? have i been the problem this entire time? i find myself becoming more bitter by the day... i snap at my boyfriend and i'm becoming more and more apathetic about it. i used to feel crippling anxiety about things like this but it feels weirdly okay to accept the fact that i'm probably not a good person. i've tried but usually i am more selfish than i am selfless, even though i TRY to help people. i am trying to be better but i find it extremely exhausting and i can't help but be a bitch most of the time quite frankly. but by putting my own interests above everyone else I know it can be shitty to deal with. i fantasize about driving off the cliff by my house all the time... when i finally get my license i think i will do it. it's this great big chasm that probably drops hundreds of feet. it's a nice thought."
1,"I watched wizard f oz today and just bawled at the ending. I’ve seen this movie 1000 times but it’s never hit me like this Scarecrow always had a brain the lion always had courageAnd the tin man always had a heart

I’ve been in a place where I don’t think I have any of those things and hearing someone say oh no you always had it the whole time just ripped me to shreds and made me break down crying"
1,"i feel like i can only enjoy life when im obsessively vain and my ego is huge. ""I am extremely attractive"" ""everybody wants me"" ""I am smarter than most people"" 

If these conditions are not met, then I feel like I just want to die. Having a huge ego is the only way I can escape my pain. It is quite the opposite of pain. idk what to do. Phenibut makes me feel this way, but I cant take it alot because it can be harmful, but it gives me the illusion that I am strong enough to cope with life. It makes me focus on the good things."
1,I just want the pain to end (21F). I don’t have purpose or drive or any positive qualities. No one loves me nor will anyone ever love me. They know I don’t deserve love. I can’t take this emptiness. I’m already slowly dying.
1,"My head. All of my thoughts are negative or far-reaching desires of mine. I've realized the only emotion I truly feel is pain and exhaustion. I don't give a fuck about getting help from family or friends. I hate almost all of the people I see in my daily activities. I want a partner, and now that we're in quarantine, I find myself fantasizing about this want much more. The emotional pain one feels in their chest has become normal to me, and I now enjoy it in some way. I believe that all people have the opportunity to change, just not me. I'll always be the quiet guy, the pushover, the shut-in. I think about killing myself a lot, and I think I'll do it another time in the future. Not tonight, nothing surefire. My standards for a partner are disgustingly high for a person such as myself, and I find myself angered with my own sense of entitlement. I want to kill myself. My head is filled with some sort of white noise, a mixture of phrases and negativity. Nobody without issues of their own wants to be with someone who has such mental problems. My mind longs for it. I wish to meet them one day, though I know I'm not active enough to find them. They don't exist anyway. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and act normally. I want to meet them, though I know I won't. Can't? I want to, though. I just wish. I don't really like this post. I want to get diagnosed, but I'll just be met with ""mind over matter"". I mask it too well, maybe it's my fault. I don't wanna express anything aloud."
1,"Idk. Yesterday I took 12 shots of vodka.... and I don’t drink. I always think it’s gonna help my depression and it always makes it worse. Not to mention I can never sleep even after it’s worn off, like rn it’s 4 am and here I am, typing this. My bf caught me cutting in the shower... and... do you ever just want the sun to come up? I’ll be able to make bacon & eggs then. It’s all about little things like that I think."
1,"I’ve lost everything. It’s my first time really doing this, but I thought it’d be best to at least share my feelings. I moved from my hometown and left everything behind. Not possessions, but my relationships that I had cherished so very much. I lost all of my friends, my best friends that I had been through thick and thin with for years, that I called family. But the one that has hit me the worst is the loss of my girlfriend. We broke up because of the long distance between us, and that has made everything so much harder. I have no one, and I don’t feel happy in the slightest. All I feel is just pain, and her and frustration because not only am I such a failure, but I’m all alone. I’m all alone and being alone is so depressing for me. I think of suicide a lot, especially since I keep all my thoughts to myself and never vent to anyone. I miss what I had, and I wish I never had to be in pain so much, all I want to be is happy. That all I want."
1,"I keep dwelling on the past and worrying about the future and I can’t stop.. I keep relapsing because of this and I literally can’t help it either, people always tell me to stop dwelling or worrying but do they realize I can’t do it? It’s too hard for me. I’m basically having relapses because of a thing that’s out of my control and it’s so painful. Nobody understands that I can’t just simply live in the present. I wish all my suffering could just end. I don’t wanna die, but I don’t want to keep living the way I’m living but I can’t do that. It’s a never ending loop."
1,"What the hell happened. I don’t understand what is wrong with me 
How can i go from so happy one day to feeling absolutely miserable less than 24 hours later. Why do the things that made me happy no longer make me happy. Even things that I liked a few days ago. Why is my motivation gone. What happened to my happy thoughts, or even my semi positive thoughts. I had a lot of hope for the future and I can’t find it anymore . Why do I feel so worthless now. Why do I feel like a failure now. Why has the progress I made suddenly vanished."
1,"Random worry 2/of many. There was this time I decided to tell everyone in my family that I was bi. Everyone was cool about it, and it made me happy:)... except for the person I live with.. my grandma. She was the last person to know. She's a Christian person that does not approve of this type of thing and says people are just being rebellious and are going to Hell for that. 
  We were outside, sitting around a small table in our front of the house. Just enjoying the day with some coffee and tea(me lol). I already had made up my mind to tell her about it. I was shaking. I wrote down what I felt that day(July 4, 2019). This is what I wrote:
 
"" I told my grandma that I liked girls. And now I can't stop crying for what she told me.. I have a major headache for holding back my screams.. or probably because I started hitting my head on the floor.
I feel like leaving because there is just no way of undoing this. Why did I say that? I was having a lovely morning and I opened my big stupid mouth! I don't feel like getting out of my room for anything.. I haven't had breakfast either.. shit. 
I just have got to calm down.. but I can't! When I think I finally stopped crying, I think of what happened and more tears keep reappearing.. kill me please.""
  
  I told her that she'd be disappointed and would throw me out. She was disappointed and said that she wouldn't throw me out. She was just a bit upset that she wouldn't be able to keep the promise she kept to my mom(Rest in Peace) of making sure I was a good Christian kid to be able to get into Heaven and see her again. I was crying in front of her. She didn't yell, but I could hear the disappointment in her voice. 
 These days we get along. Probably forgot all about it or just thought it was a phase. I won't bring it up around her though. I choose peace while I still live with her. I don't like loudness. Not negative loudness that is."
1,Life will never get better for me. I try to be a good person but maybe I’m not deep down and that’s why the world is punishing me . I just don’t wanna be here anymore .
1,"I want to get to suicide. I can’t stand this purgatory. Neither here nor there. I have a dull feeling of being fed up with life 24/7. I feel broken and I want to give up. I loathe the human experience. I understand the right way to be; take responsibility for my life and build myself up to be strong. I truly hope others can manage this for themselves but my self is gone. Every day I think about suicide but I call myself a petulant brat for even going there in my head. It’s like any concern I have for myself, any compassion is immediately shut down by the cruel voice. How do I take it further so I can kill myself? My personality is absolute garbage. This sucks and I want it to end. I have no identity, no future, I can’t love, people run from me understandably. I want to end it!"

1,"I feel guilty asking for help. whenever I vent to people or ask them for help i feel guilty and I feel like I am taking advantage of them or guilt tripping them. I really hate asking people for help or just venting. I have not been able to see my girlfriend recently either so now things are really getting bad but I feel guilty venting to her because again, I feel like I am taking advantage of her and just trying to hear what I want because I am making her feel bad for me. i don't even know half the time if im genuinely asking for help or just trying to make them feel bad for me"
1,"Is it just me?. Do any of you guys sleep and wake up in the middle of the night once or twice panicking or just randomly?Or even wakes themselves up stressed, it’s like the you kind of can’t breathe so your taking multiple deep breathes.."
1,"Feel hopeless more each day. I [22M] wish I was never born into this shitty existence of a life. Not one day has gone by where I can throughly say I'm happy with my life. I'm in debt, banking on a degree that might get me no where, making 9 dollars an hour, I have no life outside of work. All my friends are over the internet. No one makes plans with me, no one stops by to see me, no one cares. Even if they did my life still sucks. I'm just genuinely at the point where everyday becomes more a struggle. I have to take medications to feel normal (have anxiety disorder/ PTSD) . Im constantly having mental breakdowns. I hate where I live but I have no way out. I can't afford to live somewhere on 9 bucks an hour. So I'm stuck here. In hell. I hate my life everyday and the idea that it's gonna get better somehow as if all my life's problems will be gone just isn't true. As time as went on in the past decade it's only gotten worse. My moms on the brink of death with her drinking addiction. My mental problems are through the roof. I feel so helpless. 

 I've been getting mental help for almost a decade now and it just feels like my depression can never go away. I'm so nervous that once I graduate college that job I want won't be there... Im going to college for my dream job. I've always wanted to be a journalist or something to do with writing, talking about sports whether it be a reporter, news station , just something with sports. The only things keeping me going is I know I'm pursuing my dream and what I love to do. But I'm so scared that once I do get my degree that job that I've always wanted won't be there and my degree in journalism and mass communications will be worthless :(. I don't want to be a failure"
1,Help?. I'm having a rough time. I'm just so sad  and I don't know why. I just want to get better for my children and myself.
1,"I literally have the creativity of a peanut. Depression has taken alot from me honestly. I used to draw, write, and play musical instruments all the time but now I can't even pick up a pencil without having a mental breakdown. Drawing and writing used to be a form of self expression back then, it helped me cope with my issues but now the pencil seems heavy. I need to recover my old hobbies and interest but it seems so difficult."
1,how to not be suicidal when youre not on drugs and the sobering reality of resentment hate and anger come to take over your consciousness??. when i wake up tomorrow it is gonna be rough. my brain has used up a significant portion of its gaba reserves through phenibut. ugh. i am annoyed
1,"Quarantine has sent me spiraling and I don't see an end in sight. I had managed my depression pretty well in recent years. I'm 19, about to be 20, been dealing with it since about 13. Had a really hard first year of university, had somewhat suicidal thoughts on occasion, but had received enough support to know that things would get better with time. I had a great second year, really the first time I was able to fight off my depression for months at a time since I first started struggling with it.

Then when coronavirus started to get serious it was like all of my progress and hope was completely undone. I'm a very social person, my depression comes from having a lot of anxiety and general hopelessness when things look grim, but I've always felt happiest when having support/living life. Now I'm faced every day with staring at my childhood room, reading reports that this is gonna go on for 2 years. I only have a limited time to be young and honestly I can barely bear the thought of another month of this, let alone years or this becoming the new normal. I have never had this consistent thoughts of suicide even if this isn't the most depressed I've ever been. It just has never seemed this hopeless. If it looked like things would be normal even in a month or so, I think I have learned enough coping skills to manage. But this is the first time in my life where the more I see that the end date is not for months or years, the more I question how I'm going to stay sane or alive to see it. I'd rather die of the virus than rot like this. I don't want to seem selfish, obviously I don't want others in society to die just because I can't handle this, but it just seemed I had my life together and now I'm being faced with the worst circumstances for my mental health that I could ever imagine.

Some advice would be appreciated, though I assume many here would be in the same boat."
1,I hate myself. I'm back at square one and I can't escape this time
1,I feel scared about what is going to happen next in my life.. Life is so unpredictable. I am scared to make life changing choices and to see what the future holds. I don't want to be filled with regret like I am now.
1,"Everything has lost any sense. Anything to celebrate makes no sense anymore, the Christmas just don't feel like before and it makes me super anxious about everything. Then the new year's eve was seeing everyone going on parties and I was just home hanging out by myself crying over the year. And now the Easter, my mom wanted to celebrate it but I didn't want it at all and it made her cry cuz she did put work in it."
1,"Unsurprisingly, being isolated at home is terrible for my mental health. I do not like being alone with my own thoughts, prior to this pandemic, I spent the minimal amount of time home alone as possible. I study in the library or in coffee shops and I eat in cafeterias etc. I also maintain a lot of friendships. Unlike a lot of people, I don’t really get much out of entertainment media — I’m not a fan of most TV shows, movies or video games. I can’t be satisfied to sit at home and watch Netflix or read books all day. 

All that is to say that this quarantine is extremely hard for me. I can’t focus on anything and I feel quite depressed. I spend much of my days sleeping in order to avoid being alone with my own thoughts.  I’m sad."
1,"Just wanna vent and see if it has happened to anyone else. Because of depression I've been struggling with discipline and motivation in college for a while now. I've already changed from a double major to a single major because of them. On january/february, after more than a year of monthly therapy, daily medication, self improvement books vids and articles, and a lot of trial and error, I really was getting the hang of it. Going to all of my classes, studying daily, not procrastinating. For the first time since I entered college, I felt good about how I was handling things.

Boom, pandemic, quarantine. No more classes. I had no crutch anymore, no calendar to follow. No more sport to vent. No more therapy. Things went to shit quickly. 

I'm several weeks behind in almost every class. I've missed a lot of assignments and classes because I just wasn't aware. My brain feels foggy once again. My father told me that if this semester doesn't go well, he's gonna get me out of college and put me to work. I should be so determined and full of activity but my brain doesn't seem to care anymore. This is just a shitty situation overall."
1,Help. Right now I have been dealing with the fear of losing my parents and knowing someday they will die.
1,Suicidal thoughts.. Some nights im really struggling not to take a bottle of pills and slice up my whole body and just die. I hate myself so very much and i’ve just come to the realization nobody gives a shit about me and nobody ever will give a shit. I’m always the happy one helping others and talking and cheering them up but in reality i want to hang myself. The urges to cut are extreme and I just want to slice open every inch of my skin until all i feel is the sting and pain. I get bad urges to the point where i can feel it on my skin so i dig my nails into my arms trying to alleviate myself with the pain but its not enough. I need to cut.
1,Will I ever not want to die?. I'm 24 and I cant think of anything that would make me happier than not existing... the only thing I've ever wanted in this world is love and I know im not worth loving. Maybe ill die from a sickness or something soon since I'm too much of a bitch to kill myself now. Hope doesn't exist in my life. Only darkness and waiting.
1,"Nothing to see here. Just another problem child materialising their issues into a reddit post.. I‘m a massive fucking waste of life. Everything would have been so much easier if I had never existed. But it’s too late at this point. I’m now trapped in this shitty lifetime because I’m too fucking scared of dying to off myself.
I’ve come to the conclusion that living is a temporary state and I might as well just wait it out. If only to find out what happens at the end, to see if it was worth it after all. It’s so painful but my own mortality freaks me out so much that I can never bring myself to go through with it.
I’ve tried before, with a few different methods, only to spiral, at the last minute, and pussy out all over again. I guess I’m stuck between the same shitty rock and hard place as a lot of people. The ‘hate living, fear dying’ dilemma.
I’ve been told so many times that suicide is the most selfish act. I get that. I don’t want to hurt the few people still close to me. I also feel like I’ve wasted all the time, money, and energy that my parents put into raising me and it was all for nothing. I’m a failed attempt. But I can’t change, as much as I want to and as much as I’ve tried. I just don’t have the will anymore. I’m drained of motivation and reasons to try to improve myself.
I’ve picked up some pretty bad habits in my life; typical smoking, drinking, self-harm stuff. I think I’m challenging myself to see how much hurt and abuse I can inflict before I cave and finally just fucking die. But in the meantime I guess I’ll hang around and watch this shit show for a little while longer."
1,"Seeing shit again. So Ive always had trouble sleeping. Whenever I try to sleep I see, hear, feel, and smell things that aren't there. Voices tell me that someone is in my house or they impersonate family or friends. Hands and bugs start bothering me, and I start seeing figures and shapes. 

Because it's been getting worse I havent slept right in almost a week. It's 5AM and I just went downstairs to get a drink and I swear to christ there was someone in my living room. I saw them, I heard them, but the moment they were no longer in my line of sight they vanished. Now I'm hearing shit and paranoid, and I'm starting to feel like I'm just fucking losing it.

This place makes me miserable and I have every chance to just disappear to somewhere else but I dont take it.

Sorry if this makes no sense I just need to put it out there"
1,"Quarantine is proving that people are better off without me.. Hard times like these weed out the people who don't care from the people who care. It weeds out the people who need you from the people who want you.

And yet here I am, left with nobody. Partially my fault, partially just the way things are. 

Ending my life seems even more inconsequential now."
1,"Online therapy just made me feel worse than I ever have. To preface, I'm diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety, as well as a couple other things. For a while, I was in therapy, but the woman I was working with dropped me as a client out of the blue and practically fell off the grid. This was pretty hard to deal with to begin with, considering I was already having a hard time with the idea that anyone sees me as worth anything. So for a few months things were quiet and I just went on with life without therapy. Then the coronavirus quarantine started, so even if I found a therapist, we couldn't meet. Recently I've been having a lot of issues with relationships with friends, family, etc. because the progress I'd made in therapy began to really unravel. I realized that I was going to need help, so I started looking into online options. I found one that I thought would be good, went through the questionnaire, and clicked the submit button. At the end it took me to a page that said, ""thanks for taking the time to fill out our questionnaire. Unfortunately, based on the answers given, we feel that online counseling with us is not the best option for you."" 

Now I pretty much feel completely destroyed and really invalidated. I've got no one to go to, and it was already really hard for me to try this. I feel totally alone, and even though this is a small thing it destroyed any chances of me feeling confident enough to look for help."
1,Depression sucks. I feel like no matter what my depression is always gonna remind me of how much I want to die
1,"I want to go to a mental hospital but. I’m not going without my phone. My brain is on this thing. My books my music, everything. What’s everyone’s experience with this?"
1,"Does anybody else look through posts trying to find one that truly conveys your emotions but you can't find any so you feel even more depressed and mentally isolated?. Like now, I'm feeling really depressed, I'm looking through posts to try find anyone that is experiencing/having the same issues, but I can't find any. 



Does anyone else struggle with this?"
1,"February 23, 2019. Some thoughts I had:

 ""Why do we cut? Is it because we're depressed? It it because we try to show people that their words don't hurt as much as the blade? Or do we just want to feel something? Whatever the reason is; we (not all) feel the need to be asked.
  We don't like it when you found out that from someone else. We want to tell you what goes through our mysterious minds. Is a bit difficult when you're yelling though.. you aren't the ""police"" trying to make us tell you some type of information. If you could just CALMY ask us. Screaming will just make us want to keep all our feelings out of your sight so that you won't yell.
  We understand that you are worried or desperate to know,but we won't tell you willingly if you don't want to listen willingly. Please try understand.. we feel like no one could ever care if we die,disappear,or have problems in our lifes. You probably never went through what we went through. We can feel that you are upset or disappointed at us, but please.. don't give up on us.
  We might keep doing it until we are as empty as an egg shell. Not only do we cut,but we try to get rid of pain in many ways. Some do drugs,vape,drink,or are just darn mean. Some cut,bite,try to suffocate, drown,hang,or cry. We are people; and just like animals:not all of us are bad.
  When I get upset at someone,I do many different things. I get out of there,I break something,bite, or just cry for how much I feel like hurting them. While am typing this.. I cutted my arm.. a little too dip than usual. My arm feels tingly, numb,and I feel an urge to taste my blood. Wierd?
  When people make me feel depressed, I have a sick pain in my stomach that makes me feel like throwing up or punching my stomach. I just read that when you cut yourself; your life spam(or something like that) decreases by 6%. I must be close to dying then :')... I have many friends that do the same,that feel like they can't keep on going. Some friends that I left behind because of moving. 
  She had depression.. I don't know how she's doing now. I hope she made it to the top! After talking to one of my old friends, she said that four people had died during Freshman year. I was so worried that it could have been my friend.. I left her without succeeding to make her change her mind.
  I have more in my mind,but am too tired. I'll go to sleep now. Night. And morning just in case I don't wake up.."""
1,"Worsening. everything is getting worse. i’ve already been dealing with wanting to kill myself every god damn day for like the past year. i’ve been trying to break up with my boyfriend who refuses to leave, and he says if he leaves hes gonna kill himself. my little brother got into a car accident on easter and is pretty much needing our 24/7 care. i’ve relapsed which doesn’t help anymore. i just want xans but then i feel like the only person i want will leave. i dont know what the fuck to do."
1,"I’ve never been suicidal, and I’ve always assumed I’d never be put on anti-depressants unless I was suicidal. But I’m starting to think otherwise. Anyone have any POSITIVE experiences with SSRIs?. I think like many people on here, I’ve been plagued by depression most of my life. At least as far back as I can remember, likely the early teenage years (I’m 25 now). With being indoors all day, it only has gotten worse. 

My depression has never made me think about suicide, not even for a fraction of a second. I just never have thought about it.

My depression is simply lack of literally all energy. I wake up, and lay in bed for a solid 3 hours (on a good day). I think nothing happy, and just feel absolutely no happiness or urgency to do anything. 

Over the past year, since being in grad school, my depression has most definitely gotten worse. I don’t want to get up. No amount of caffeine can help me accomplish anything. I truly just do NOT have energy in me.

I have tried everything to bring positive change in my life. After the 3 hours of doing Fuck all, I drag myself to the gym 5-6 days a week. I am able to eat healthy. I’ve managed to get quite muscular, while at the same time being horribly depressed with no desire to pursue friendships or relationships. I go on long walks, I run and other forms of cardio.

There is only so much exercise and self care I can do. It keeps me from falling into a true pit of despair I believe, but it certainly doesn’t cure my depression in the slightest.

I’ve now started to think trying anti depressants may be for me. I had my testosterone tested. Twice. It’s completely normal. So I know it isn’t lack of that hormone, which I had suspected before to due lack of libido.

Does this sound like a case which would see a positive change by trying anti depressants? Can I at least try it, come off if I don’t like it? I honestly don’t know what else to do at this point. I’m not in danger of trying to take my own life. I just simply don’t have energy to DO any life."
1,"I hate School. I hate school

So I randomly started thinking about when I was in Year 7 ( In UK, currently Year 10). But anyway I have low functioning autism which sucks incredibly( I’ll get onto that later), so I had been at this pretty good school that worked you pretty hard and the week before half term I was basically just talking with my new friend of about 2 months, and we were just joking around on the bus when I lightly slapped him on the face, anyway I thought nothing of it and we continued talking until we got to school. When we got there though a Year 12 I think came up to me and said why did you hit ____, which I was confused by and basically just went to class. Later in the second class of the day the lower school headmaster( or whatever weird title he had) came in and took me out of class, and I was completely confused, but he said that _____ had gone to the nurses with a red mark on his face( he wasn’t in my class btw) which I knew was total bullshit as I hardly touched his face but then as I have low functioning autism it basically means I lose complete function over my body and I said I wanted to kill myself and the teacher was complete shit at handling it.

Fast forward a few months and I basically developed anger management, depression, etc. and I was still at the school getting in for about 2 hours a week and feeling like utter crap. 

Then just before the first Christmas of Year 7 and I moved to another school which was honestly great, I mean I had loads of friends (actually good friends this time) and I was seeing a counsellor at the school and I felt slightly better about myself. Then after two months the counsellor, who was fully confidential, literally reported my dad to the local council as he was mentally abusive to me and I needed to tell someone so I told them, so thanks to that shit show I lost all confidence in that school and moved on.

I then had a few day trials at schools and did a month on an online school which was terrible.

Then in the Easter term of Year 8 I went to another school, for a term long trial, and I enjoyed that again and it was ok apart from the end of term when it felt like no one cared about me and I basically just walked out one day ( because I wanted to go home so I went to the office were they were supposed to call my mum, they refused and so for pretty much 2 hours I sat on the sofa by the office until I just couldn’t be fucked and left) then on that same my mum went for a meeting and the school said they wouldn’t take me back next year and I cried and was incredibly depressed for about a week.

I’ve now found a tiny collage with 6 people in a class that’s literally meant for me as I was the first student there, and while it has its ups and downs it pretty good and I’ve actually been at one school for almost two years.

Honestly though just thinking about how one person saying that I punched them has basically ruined 3 years of my life and possibly will affect my adult life, it just makes me annoyed and depressed which is why I felt I had to get it out of my system.

Hopefully this is the right place to post it, but if not can someone tell me what the suitable subreddit is."
1,"Not ready to get off anti-depressants. So I've been on anti-depressants for about 5 years. 2 years ago I found a medication that works really well for me. Last year I was consistently feeling good so my psychiatrist started tapering me down. The past couple months however I started having days where I just get really down. At first I thought it could just be the normal ups and downs a person has, but those days have been becoming more frequent and now most days of the week I'm left feeling that once familiar emptiness of depression. I'm scared to bring it up to my parents, since they were happy about me getting off the meds."
1,"I can't understand what's going on with me. Maybe I'm just getting crazy.. It's night, and I'm just laying in the bed and crying.
All that situation with quarantine, just left me alone with my own thoughts. In the last days I just ignore my friends, school. Shit! I ignore my own life. There's my birthday in one day, but can't think it like a happy day. I don't know if I will be alive. The biggest shit, I can't talk about it to someone. While I am staying in Discord with my friends, I turn off the microphone and cry. I don't wanna die. I honestly don't wanna die. But I don't know how I must live my life. I wrote all this, just hoping someone will read it."
1,"I am 17, and I am thinking about suicide.. Here is everything wrong with me:

I am the loneliest person ever. I feel like nobody cares about me.

Relationships: i cannot get a any guy to look at me or admire me. Nobody looks me at me and thinks I'm good enough. The love of my life is no longer with me and it hurts so bad I cant take it anymore. I cry everyday after 11 months the heartbreak is tearing me apart. Ever since the breakup I've been fantasizing my own death. Plus the lack of affection and intimacy is driving me insane.

My body: I am skinnier than everyone I meet. It makes me feel abnormal. I do not have curves like other women and it makes me feel embarrassed. 

I'm too socially awkward, I cringe everytime I speak, it is awful I dont know why I cant interact normally and develop close friendships.

I am just a mess. So ugly and embarrassing. And I don't deserve to be alive"
1,"Does Instagram make you feel like you’re not good enough?. (30M) While I do believe that Instagram can be a good platform to promote certain things like photography, music, etc., on the flip side, I do feel like it’s just not good for you if you suffer with depression and/or anxiety. People constantly show off how nice looking their bodies are, brag about how successful they are, etc., and it just fuels my depression like crazy. I try the best I can not to spend a lot of time on there for the sake of my mental health."
1,"I am the worst. Everyone I know is either getting married or has a deep family connection or fucking something. I’ve never been able to get close to my family, and in all honestly I truly believe their lives would be exactly the same if not better if I wasn’t here. All I can do every day of every week of every goddamn month is just lay in my bed and do nothing. I don’t have the energy to get out, to better myself, to do fucking ANYTHING. Sure I have some friends, but they don’t see me more than once every two weeks, but anyone that I’ve spent longer periods of time with couldn’t fucking stand me for longer than a week. And don’t even get me started on relationships, where the idea of being with me is so horrible that every girl has left within a week, and that’s not even an exaggeration, I’ve had more relationships last 2 days than last a full month. If my family doesn’t care that I’m here, if my friends rarely ever see me and therefore rarely ever think of me, and love is something that I can never have, then why in the fuck am I even fucking here in the first place. I just want this all to end, I’m so fucking tired. I just wish someone would come kill me so I wouldn’t have to do it myself, I can’t fucking do this anymore"
1,"Does anyone else have an online shopping problem?. I’m pretty sure many people do, but to me, it gives me something to look forward to, even if it only brings me temporary happiness. I know it’s addictive and bad for my self-control and wallet, but it’s like I don’t have much to look forward to.

I was supposed to go to a school trip to Washington DC in May. That kept me afloat for a few weeks. But because of COVID19, that’s been canceled. I used to look forward to going to my Federal Work Study job at a nonprofit. I looked forward to the commute, eating out, and even working, because anything is better than being at home. I was looking forward to max out my hours to save up for the car I hope to get at the end of the summer. 

But nada, nothing. For now, the only thing I can look forward to is the temporary bursts of happiness I get waiting a package. After that, life just goes deeper downhill. It’s been like this even before COVID19. But I could look forward to going to classes. Now I feel like I don’t have much to live for..."
1,"My thoughts part 2. I really attack myself and destroy my own happiness. 

I'm worthless. 

I compare myself to others so I can put myself down. 

I keep my head down and my voice shut so I become a walking ghost. 

Everything is wrong with me. 

Other people learn from their mistakes. I tend to repeat them. 

As the seasons change, I stay the same. 

I'm weak physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

I want to be worth something. 

I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. 

All the moments in my life led to this. 

Excuses are half the things that come from my mouth. 

You are disgusting. You are fat. You are worthless. No one would want someone with self-harm scars. You are damaged goods. Broken, and not physically. You complain about the dumbest shit and you're always ready to attack, even though you don't need to. You self pity because it's easier to accept than the truth that you're a dumb cunt. 

I want to ruin the opportunities before me so I have something to complain about. 

I'll never be satisfied with who I am. 

My emotions shouldn't rule me but they seem to be both king and queen. 

I liked to be walked on, overlooked, picked last. It reminds me of who I am.

Maybe I just wasn't meant to be in the end. 

I wish I could learn but you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

My brain tears itself apart without my help."

1,Is it wrong to be mad at people who have a better life than you?. Not being selfish or anything but it only makes me feel sorry for myself for not having the same life as theirs and I absolutely hate feeling sorry for myself because I feel like I'm not worthy of self love
1,"How to eat. Hi, first post here. 

My ex-boyfriend broke my heart on Friday and I’ve been in a really intense depressive episode since. I just feel incredibly numb or overwhelmingly sad. I haven’t been able to eat since I had a bowl of yogurt Friday morning. I know that it’s unhealthy for me to go this long without eating, but I’ve been feeling nauseous every day all day since he ended it. I can’t even stomach the thought of eating. Plus with the quarantine, no car, and no family or friends around me it’s rather restrictive for what I can and cannot do. 

Any advice or help is appreciated"
1,I need to talk to people.. I'm just looking to talk about life. Reflect ideas with other people who have the same depression issues. Do you ever feel like your life stopped and now you're just watching the world go by in a fading gray blur with no idea how to get better? I think about this constantly and it really makes me want to just go to sleep forever.
1,"fuck.  I’m terrified about the thought that I might wake up someday and realize that I haven’t done a single fulfilling thing in my entire life. I just graduated so when the confinement is over I’ll be able to join the workforce but I’m not at all passionate about my line of work, I chose it because it was the one I thought I’d hate the least. I’m not really good at anything, I’ve never really achieved anything noteworthy, if you asked me to tell you about the proudest moment of my life I’d probably scratch my head for 5 minutes only to realize I really haven’t done anything ever. For some reason I recognize that but I don’t do anything to change it, it’s like I’m waiting to magically feel happy and fulfilled for no apparent reason. I’ve ironically had a “I’M GONNA CHANGE” sign taped on my wall for the past 3 years but nothing has realistically really changed at all. I’m a useless human being and I’ll keep being one until the day I die, this is just the kind of person I am. Unable to do anything at all. All I know how to do is write late night rants that I’m too afraid to share to anyone because I don’t want people to realize how much of a fucking waste of space I am."
1,"Idk what to do. A couple months ago I was having a rough time with life and I was getting to be super sad. I thought nobody could love me and I always felt alone even when I was with my friends and family. Then one day this girl texted me and she thought I was cute, but I guess I got too attached to her and drove her away and she didn't like me anymore after a few days of talking. After messing that up I was super depressed and wanted to kill myself because I felt like I had no place in this world anymore. Then I got a text from that girls friend and she said she wanted to talk because she felt bad that her friend did that to me. I've been talking to that girl ever since. About a month ago I found out that this girl really likes me. It's been amazing and I've actually felt loved for the first time in years. But for the last couple weeks I've had this overwhelming feeling that she isnt gonna be there forever. I really like her and want to keep her around but I'm worried that she will leave and I'll fall back into the deep pit she pulled me out of. She saved my life and I don't think I could let her go if she left me."
1,"Getting Help. (16m) I don't know how to go about asking for help. My parents have mental health issues that they take medication for, so I know they will understand. I really can't explain what's keeping me from talking to them about it. I think it mostly has to do with me hating pity. It makes me feel extremely guilty and like I'm making someone waste their time worrying about me. I've been dealing with this for about 2 years and there's times where it gets so bad that I can't get out of bed and I obsessively think about suicide. I know I need help and I want help but I don't know how to get past the fact that I will hate myself for making them worry, because when I get pitied my mind decides I no longer want help and only want to die so I won't be able to bother anyone anymore. Thanks for reading this."
1,".. was having fun with fiancé, I took it too far, instantly ignored. said sorry so many times, still ignored. I’m sorry. Please say something to me. I can’t take it. Please I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you I was just having fun I have had a few drinks I’m so sorry I didn’t know I pulled your hair a little too hard you’ve liked that before but that doesn’t mean I get to do it whenever it’s my fault I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry either hate me and leave or talk to me please talk to me I can’t handle it I’m the worst I hate myself I’ll kill myself if you tell me to please just let me kill myself please please please just say I can just tell me it’s ok to end my life promise to take care of my mom and tell me it will be ok without me I can’t handle this anymore even when you love me I can’t handle it I’ll kill myself eventually just let me do it sooner rather than later please please please"
1,"Anyone else feel like this pandemic and quarantine was a kind of low blow?. I've had depression for a while, pratically since middle school (I'm 21 now btw) and just recently I was actually having a good time with life and wanted to get out of bed. I felt comphortable around people and for the first time in a long time knew what I was doing,, I was dare I say it actually happy for a bit. But then the whole quarantine thing happened and it kind of sent me on a downward spiral of what the best way to describe it is sort of loneliness and self hatred. 

The main thing that kind of started said spiral was when none of my friends ever called to check up on me, it's something minor and so so petty I feel like a fucking 13 year old girl talking about it (No offense to any 13 yr girls out there, I'm talking about the sterotype.) And I feel wrong for being bummed out by that. 

So I guess to sum it up or a tl;dr, was anyone else kind of a bit happy before the self isolation/Quarantine.

(Sorry that none of this makes sense, I just really needed to write this down and tell someone, even if it was to a bunch of rando's. Thanks for reading this far)"
1,"When you’re sinking in a deep pool of water but don’t want to self-rescue. Don’t know if anyone else shares this same feeling or not. Everyday when the sun sets, I just feel like sinking in darkness. Lonely, hopeless, desperate to quit the depressed feeling. Then I realize this has already been happening for a year already. I sit in front of a computer. When I’m tired, I stand up and eat. When I’m tired standing, I lie on the bed and imagine myself sinking deeper. Keep wondering if I actually want to survive if I’m drowning and falling deep down the dark sea. 

Probably I still want to be rescued. But unmotivated to make myself survive - when I know there is not going to be anyone coming to rescue. Another tired and sleepless night."
1,"How much crying is normal?. Recently I've just cried for no reason multiple times throughout the day and some days I just slump on my bed, staring at the ceiling and cry. Like no one has died or anything I don't feel any pain or emotion at all but I just cry and wonder why I'm crying in the first place. There's only that weight on my chest and tears cause puddles around me. Is this what normal people do? Do people cry for no reason or is crying reserved for sadness?"
1,"How can I help my partner?. I think he is suffering from depression. Below are examples of the messages he’s sent me and he’s completely shutting me out and refuses to talk. It’s been around 10 days of this. 

I don’t really know how to deal with the situation. Should I just let him be? Or should I keep insisting (E.g calling, going to his house, sending him texts)?

“ Sorry I just don't have any energy. I want to be left alone for a while”
“ I love you too. Just need some time to myself. I'm not feeling great and stressed and have no energy.”
“ I'm stressed, I'm tired, I'm foggy. Just leave me be for a while”

Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

Thanks!"
1,"I wasted the two most important years of my life sitting around doing dumb stuff. I’m a 17 year old athlete with 0 marketable skills. For the last 2 years I’ve sat on my ass being lazy and smoking weed. I don’t care about sports anymore. I realized that they are absolutely meaningless and I want to have a very successful career in business. I switched up my goals at 16 but it was already too late to get ahead. Because the leading people in their respective industries were not being lazy at 15, they were working hard and planning out their careers. At 14 I was wasting my time trying to become a pro athlete instead of thinking about my actual career. At 13 I had absolutely 0 vision and perspective about life. I haven’t done any of that realistic planning and I don’t even know where to start and I fear it’s too late for me because I only have 1 year left. I’m so stressed I feel it all on my shoulders, my entire future riding on my self worth."
1,"Depression in the time of Corona. What are some healthy but not hokey ways folks are coping with Corona related depression? When you're forced to be isolated and distanced from others? I  cant get out of bed most days. I find myself tearing up and crying frequently. I feel hopeless and unmotivated - I can't concentrate on anything. 

I'm lucky - I have a job and I can work from home, better than so many people. But I need to KEEP my job.

I usually cope with depression by staying busy and active in my hobbies, visiting friends. Distracting!  Hard to so that now being stuck inside all day, everyday. 

Help."
1,"Met with my psychiatrist again. Turns out she’s starting to think I’m a lost cause. She says it seems like I’m not putting in enough effort to feel better. I lost 3 jobs, crashed my car, tried to off myself, and had my family tell me they don’t want me around them anymore. All of this in under 2 months. Bills are piling up and I’m terrified I’m gonna get evicted and no jobs are getting back to me. Am I crazy for wondering how exactly I’m supposed to feel better amongst all this bullshit? It seems like my life is an endless stream of unending chaos. Now even the people who are literally paid to give a shit about me are saying they don’t want to deal with me anymore. I’m just so tired of it all. I want everything to stop. I just want out of my head for a few minutes. I can’t even buy drugs to try and cope with this shit ( I know it’s a bad way to cope. I don’t care anymore ). I got scammed by a dealer and my reliable dealer moved away. I just want one thing to go my way. I’m starting to think it’s impossible for me to win anything. There’s no small victories anymore. I’m so tired."
1,"Narc Ex. Suicidal. Stuck.. I (25F) met my narcissistic ex husband (25M) five months before we were married. I know it sounds stupid.. But he was everything I ever wanted... And needed... And I seemed to also be for him.. I had faith.. 
Everything changed as soon as we got married and he became abusive and cold. Now it is almost nine months since I have been at my parents house... Still waiting for divorce to be over and done with.. But I feel so finished..

He was the LOVE of my LIFE... Abuse and all.. I got married for life.. For a reason... Not just to be thrown away.

I cannot get past it.. I cannot find anyone that can measure up to all he was to me... I had been so happy and alive.. I still cannot believe the change... I don't want to believe it... 

Now I have someone persuing me, and I want to open myself up to it... But all I feel is pain. And memories. And every night I just want to bash my head in to stop thinking so much about this. My new life was supposed to start and now I am just an empty shell of what I was.. I hate that he changed... I hate that I loved him so much.. I hate this stupid stupid life. I don't want to be here. Where I am is not where I'm supposed to be and there is nothing I can do about it.. I am drowning. And I am the only one who can feel the water around me. I'm done with it all."
1,"Can I hop in the boat too?. This lockdown has really been getting to me too. It's been getting to me, even if I'm a less cynical of a person now.

It definitely reminds me of my childhood where I had very limited friends since I was sort of this emo nerd who got along with everyone but was never really kept around, no matter how hard I tried. I've had contact with a few of my close friends, but I've been wanting more than the sporadic texts or the very rare phone call. I've been sort of falling into the routine of getting up, writing or drawing, cleaning, reading, studying just for the hell of it, and exercising. My dogs passed away last year, and they were the only reasons why I felt anything and the only reasons why I stayed home after college.

I can't ask my family for support since they keep telling me ""millions of people are going through the same thing"". But are those millions of people suffering related to them? No. I get it, people have it worse, but I'm allowed to feel the way I feel. I had a lot of time to research my own psyche and why I am the way I am, and it sucks really bad. I miss working so I can distract myself from those thoughts, and the thoughts of returning home feeling like I'm not good enough. Feeling like I'm a failure for being 25 and not being financially stable enough to make rent in Hawaii, where it costs a fucking kidney and liver to rent a shitty ass apartment and have a car, even with another person. I help out as much as I can at home, but it never feels like enough. I thought I was going somewhere with my life. I had huge plans.

This is the first time in a very long time I've let my feelings out since I always felt like I was being a baby when I did. As long as I can remember, I've kept my feelings to myself because when I was a kid it was always ""Don't get upset."", ""Why are you getting mad for?"", ""There's no reason to be depressed, it's all in your head."", ""You can't hang out with these decent kids you like because I don't know or like them."" So as a result, instead of being resilient like I thought I was throughout high school and college, it turns out I've just become an overly-critical, avoidant, closed-off asshole who kept her nose in books instead of trying to make meaningful relationships. I'm still trying to work out how to maintain friendships, maintain a relationship, and not distance myself the moment I get too close to anyone. I think I might be so closed off that even words can't help me at this point. Yet, I still miss people.

I didn't even ask to be born, as ungrateful as it sounds. I thought I was getting better, too. It might have just been my imagination."
1,"Do you ever feel like doing nothing?. Sometimes I just want to do my homework, but then whats the point of it anyway if I'm gonna kill myself later anyway? Then I realize I'm too much of a coward to kill myself because I know I would be tortured in hell because of everything I did. I want to talk to my friends about my depression, but I dont want to act needy or burden them to the point where they leave me."
1,"Can’t even sleep anymore. After realizing how bad life was getting I was loosing sleep, I thought it was normal and I read about it a lot. After a month after me not being able to sleep I realized this is getting bad. I sleep 5 nights every week and it doesn’t sound that bad but it is horrible considering the days I do sleep I fall asleep at 12.

I wake up at 9am and am tired as fuck. I tried lucid dreams and tips on how to fall asleep. I know this might not be the right subreddit or whatever but I don’t know how to sleep. Anybody have advice?"
1,"I can't stop hating my life because I'm not as rich as my friends.. To begin, I'm a 20 something med student. My family is not poor but we're not doing that great either. But due to being in med school I'm being exposed to a lot of flexing (both intended and unintended) from my classmates. This is mostly because a lot of the students here have medic parents, and are therefore pretty rich. Cool cars, newest phone, expensive PCs, expensive clothes.

Now I don't really care about phones and clothes, but seeing them drive cool cars and play the newest games hurts me deeply, as both of those are big passions of mine. I love cars but my parents can't afford to buy me one, and med school doesn't leave me time to get a job. I also love gaming but all I have is a crappy laptop and I can't afford a better one right now either.

Due to all of this, it pains me when we leave class and almost every friend of mine hops into their car while I walk home or they give me a lift. Same when my friends talk about such and such video game while I sit there thinking what 2002 game I should play.

Now, I know what you're (probably) going to say: Some people have it worse. And I agree. But here's the kicker. A lot of people also have it a lot better. Some dudes my age drive million dollar cars and have the most expensive shit, and I can't help but hate this life for being so unfair and wondering why I wasn't born rich too. And nobody seems to ever think about how quite a lot of people have it so much better, instead focusing on the people that have it worse. And that whole ""Money does not buy happiness"" is just a tactic for rich people to keep us simpletons from rioting against their evil thiefy asses and settle for the leftovers.

This also brings me to another issue: I hate rich people with all my broke-ass heart. I have rich friends and they are nice, but it seems like most rich people are complete assholes. And it irks me how some dudes flex their wealth even though their parents are rich, not themselves. But still, their life is a lot easier and more fun. And I hate them because of my envy. This poisons my soul and makes me a bitter person.

Again, I would love to work and buy the stuff I want, but I really don't have time for a job. Med shool is quite hard, and not even the quarantine makes it any better since I still wake up early, still study, still partake in classes and lectures (online) and still have assignments. I don't know what job I could possibly sneak into my schedule since I have like 2 free hours daily. And this is not bullshit, I'm down to try anything if you have suggestions.

Every day, from when I wake up until I go to sleep, I hate my life for being so mediocre and unfair. Please help me stop being so materialistic. I'm sure there are lots of wise people here that could guide me and save my soul. This thing is ruining me, it's really bad. It clouds my judgement and makes me hateful. But no matter how hard I try, I always come back to my mindset of ""Why should I bother working my ass off just to MAYBE have a fraction of what other people lucked into at birth? Why play the rigged game? Life is unfair and I shouldn't bother since I was unlucky at birth""

Please help me get rid of this mentality. I know I'm a hateful piece of shit that doesn't appreciate what he has, but I want to change this."
1,"Anyone feel like they were fixing their mental health then stay-in mandates backtracked any progress?. My depression has been progressively getting worse over the last 2 years to the point where my physical health is severely being affected. I found a therapist that I really got along with and we had started the process of possibly starting me on medication. Then what really felt like overnight I was confined to my house No school No job No therapy. Everything feels like it’s been put on pause and I’m not sure I’m able to survive a pause. I do understand the circumstances of the pandemic far outweigh the discomforts I feel at home what can I do though ? I can still contact my therapist but since it’s done through my university they’ve set up a ‘call in as needed’ system and with my family around the house there isn’t much room for privacy. Medication has to be placed entirely on hold being unable to leave the house and I’m not sure if at the moment that’s an allowable necessity. And routine feels unattainable, I’m too anxious at night to sleep then sleep all day and I can’t tell if I’m consciously avoiding meals or not but either way I eat a lot less. Lack of basic self care isn’t new but a month ago I felt like I was doing the right things to fix that and now I just feel lost."

I make eye contact then I start fluttering, and then I redirect myself.
It’s really fckn annoying because I’m self aware of it after the fact, and when I do it.
I know why I do this. It’s because of everything I had to go through growing up but damn FUCK
I need to get it out on here idc man

1,"I hate everything. I hate other people as a concept. I don't belong anywhere, not even here. I can't relate to anyone but I still feel like shit i think. I don't wanna talk about it but i don't wanna pretend i'm fine either. I don't even know how i really feel. I rarely do. I don't know..."
1,"My head hurts man. I’m just unsure about everything. Who I am, what I want to do, if people who say they love me really mean it. It’s driving me crazy. Like I don’t even know if my gf really means it when she says it. I don’t want to be like this. But I can’t help it and it’s killing me."
1,"I'm nobody's first choice, ever.. Nobody comes to me first when they need something. It may be a romantic partner, sexual partner, or, even about the things I know very well, they never choose to ask me first. I'm always asked second or never. 

Nobody chooses me.

And I can't blame them.

I wouldn't choose me either."
1,Feeling lost. Been talking to this girl ive had feelings for for a while and she keeps sending mixed signals plus im withdrawaling from opiates and benzos so doesnt help my overthinking... idk what to do i think i love her but i have no clue how she feels about me and im too scared to straight up ask..
1,"I just dropped out of my first semester in college..  I've struggled with my mental health for more than a decade. I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I'll feel fine for a good while, and then it'll hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I couldn't even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I'm simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know if I'm ever going to return to college. I'm still in debt for this class too. I'm living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan. I'm grateful to have it. I don't know what kind of life awaits me. I'm 23, and time just seems to zoom by. I don't know if I can handle a job. I'm very socially anxious, very self concious and self hating, and when the depressive episode hits, I'm 100% useless for an extended period of time. I'm good at art... drawing, writing... I'm even working on game design. I wrote a novella late last year and sold it on amazon but didn't make much, I didn't have much for marketing. I guess I'm just going to persue a commission based income with art and other creative things I could possibly come up with... Etsy maybe? I don't know... All I know is that I feel sad, and disappointed. Guilty as well. Always very guilty. But I did learn that the traditional route of college, and standard job just isn't going to work for me. I really don't want to have to be on SSI forever, but a good start may just be honing my craft and selling my services online. If you've read this, thank you. I don't really know anyone I can talk to right now. I just needed to tell somebody."
1,"Some of us can’t be saved.. I think after 20 years of this shit it’s probably time to throw in the towel.  I’m not talking suicide, i’m giving up on looking for treatment.  I think in the time i’ve been trying to get help i’ve probably tried almost every med out there and the end result is that not only am i depressed but i now have a long list of permanent side effects that make my life even more miserable, something i had not thought was possible.  It’s honestly rather amazing that nothing seems to help the pain.  Hell, i even tried drinking depression away only to find that the more drunk i got the more i hated myself.  

In all honesty, I would have taken a long walk off a short pier years ago if it weren’t for my family.  There’s just something so uplifting about having 6-7 members of your family tell you (at different times) they don’t want you to kill yourself because it would make them sad.  I’m sure they thought they were helping in their own inept way but really, all it did was drive home the fact that my whole life i’ve been an utter failure and all i’ve ever really done is hurt and disappoint my family.  So as much as i would love to become intimate with a bridge abutment.  I’m stuck here in my little hole, it’s the one thing i can do that won’t disappoint anyone or cause me more pain.  I have no idea why the fuck i’m posting this, maybe spreading the misery around will make it feel better."
1,"Depressed all the time. I never really was depressed i just had really bad anxiety.. i was taking Effexor and it wasn’t helping my anxiety so i got put on Zoloft but now it seems like my anxiety is worse and I’ve been so depressed lately and just down and i don’t even really know why. 
I have a video appointment with my therapist to discuss my meds Tuesday, any suggestions."

Besides this I suffer from depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, ocd and agoraphobia. With so many mental health shit that’s going on, I am starting to get more depressed and asking myself if it’s worth it to go through all of this. I haven’t had a single day where I felt actually good without any worries in years. Life is exhausting and I am struggling to even get out of bed right now. I want to cry, but I can’t, because I’m emotionally not in balance. Besides everything, I can’t even name a single good thing about myself anymore. I feel like I’m totally out of place in this world and I have no purpose at all."
1,"I don’t feel the boredom everyone is complaining about.. Can anyone relate to this?  I have desires to do things but I can never bring myself to actually do any of them.  Boredom isn’t affecting me like it does all of my peers.  I don’t find myself feeling restless at all.  I don’t feel tired of staying inside or just using my phone, I think it’s because I’m so conditioned to being exhausted and never doing anything else.  
I can’t describe exactly my feelings on this subject but hopefully someone in the comments might relate and understand better."
1,"I just want to stop existing. Get killed. Die honourably (run in front of a train to save a kid or something). M24. In law school. Life sucks. Quality of life is on the decline. Compared to past generationts we are producing more and more wealth for our corporate overlords while quality of life continues to fall. Bad enough. Due to COVID, I am now unemployed this summer and had to move back in with my parents. Hate it. Compeltely feels like everything I ever worked for is pointless. That I am back at square one.

Live in Canada but of South Asian Muslim background. South Asian Muslim culture is f*cked up. Teens and young adults are infantilized. Really not good for one's self-esteem and sense of self worth. I was a devout Muslim in my teens. Left the faith about 4 years ago. I believe in creator and I do believe in certain religious values but I do not believe in Islam or in any particular religion. Honestly, I abhor Islam. The God of Islam is harsh and cruel and has ridiculous demands. Full rigidity. No Flexibility. Like starting in 10 days I have to spend a month starving and dehydrating myself to appease a psychotic God who will severely punish me if I don't. It spikes my depression. And since I am unemployed at stuck at home, I really have to sneak to cheat. And I feel bad doing it when my family is fasting. My dad is really religious and I have a super religious grandma (typical stereotype) so religion is a dominant topic in the house. I also have objections to its truth claims, I just in good conscience cannot accept Muhammed as an infallible final prophet and a source of moral authority

I have never really had it great. Never really had friends growing up outside of a couple family friends. Didn't really make friends till undergrad, and the first group of friends I made turned out to be sociopaths out to get me. I have some friends now. I am also close to my little cousins but they live abroad so I cannot really be in contact with them. Of course, my extended family are all mostly practicing Muslims as well so I cannot really have an honest relationship w/ them and I worry about the future. Either I have to pretend to be a Muslim, end up in a loveless arranged marriage, and keep familial ties. Or I officially leave the faith and destroy my family.

In my 4th year of undergrad (2017-2018) I fell in love with someone who was everything I ever wanted in a partner. Successful, moral, life-partner type, virign, great with kids (all of which I bring to the table). Everything I was looking for. She also was, as a bonus, from a well-of finally and beautiful. She was what it seemed to be a true happily ever after. I had suffered a lot and worked hard in life. My family isn't poor (though we were that when we were younger) but we are not rich. My undergrad college though was full of rich, white private school kids. I put in a lot of effort to get where I am at (my resume is stellar and I had to overcome a lot of barriers to get there). The idea that my effort paid of and I could marry a rich white private school girl was a dream come true. She and I got along very well. She was kind hearted. I really thought I had found my match. But for whatever reason, she rejected me. My entirety of everything I worked so hard toward my whole life for - my happily ever after (and yes I know no marriage is truly like that) taken away from me.
I have not been able to find anyone like her. And even worse, because I am male, I have been attacked instead of given sympathy. The dating system is rigged against men. Men are systematically oppressed by women into making the first move. Into taking the emotional burden. Into being and acting a certain way and catering to women's views. Women claim to believe in equality but sure don't act it, by holding men to traditional gender roles while they themselves have been freed from it. Men are still statistically seen as ATMs and providers. And this has bene shown from what people have told me. People have attacked me for wanting a fair deal. That because I am a man I have to be open to marrying down. That despite all the barriers I overcame, I have to be open to marrying someone who has it easier and didn't accomplish as much, ruining all the effort I made in life. That because of my gender, it is my fault she rejected me because I didn't ""ask her out correctly"" or whatever BS hoops men are expected to jump through. (I don't see how it should make a difference but apparently it does. Must be nice being a privelged woman). As a man, I am told that I must just accept a woman who slept around and then wants to settle later in life. Doesn't matter that I come in with purity and certain values. That I have to accept nonense. She didn't go down 2 steps to be with me, and her things were based on privilege of birth, not effort or morals. But I am expected to go down 20 steps to be with whomever

She also was a Catholic. So when I fell for her I started looking into the faith and I found a different kind of God. A loving God. I was so close to converting. If I actually married her, I would have converted. But I do not think the faith is true either. Sure I like things about it, but if it were true God would have given me way in, I.e. that woman's love. Again I thought I found happiness but it was taken away from me. 

I just want someone who loves me unconditionally for whom I am. My parents don't due to faith. So unlike most of the world, I don't have that. I don't have true love. Which is why I can never be happy. And it seems that men do not get true love. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. That men do get valued beyond being resources for women, but it doesn't seem like that.

I would love to be a rich western culture woman. Get the best of everything. I encountered many of them at undergrad, living the dream life. It would be great to have parents accept you for who you are. It would be great to have financial oppurnity. To have tons of self-esteem boosts from suitors. To have true love and relationship dynamics rigged in your favour. I love kids, if I was a woman I could get either get a one night stand (though that kind of behavior is not my thing) or go to a sperm bank and get a kid. As a man, I must commit to a woman and hope she doesn't divorce and take the kids. More stress, less options

I really hate who I am. I wish I were a rich western woman. Living that happy life. Instead I am cursed. Never fully accepted by my family. Raised in a f*cked up religion / culture. Oppressed via society due to my gender. Never get true love and be loved unconditionally for who I am. Quite likely never get kids. Never get happiness. And will just suffer, working as a corporate slave till I die.

Sorry for the rambling. Thanks for lsitening"
1,"child free, that's me. also, husband free. and i think strongly that that is what i want forever. it's not depression although thinking about my finances does depress me. growing old single, without an awsome career, fucking sucks. i worry alll the time. anybody relate?"
1,"I’m cold hearted ?. Sometimes I feel like I come across as cold to people. They get used to this fake persona that I present, then when I’m not pushing it people will tell me I seem cold or calm. I don’t know what you want? I’m trying my best? I just feel empty sometimes. Life seems pointless sometimes. Sorry my emptiness is showing. I don’t even know anymore."
1,"i thought i was above thinking this way. but now i realize how naive i was to think it was possible to be “above” depression, “above” suicidal thoughts. before this i was always in charge of my feelings, and i thought it was just how the brain worked. you recognize your emotions and you control them and you act on them. happiness, sadness, anger, fear; it’s *your job* to control them, and if you can’t, then you’re failing. that’s how i always thought.

but now i fucking swear my depression is totally in charge of me and i can’t regain that control. it doesn’t just make me cry and mope, it completely changed the way i think. i lost my level-headedness that i was always so proud of. my depression keeps me up until 5 am and wakes me up at 8. i’m so tired that i have to drink tons of coffee but i can’t eat a bite of anything without feeling immediately nauseated. so all that’s in my system is caffeine, all day, every day. always jittery and anxious and in cold sweats. i feel like i’m some form of walking depression.

i never thought i’d understand how some people could be moved to suicide. i know i have things and people to live for. i know i have people who love me and who’d be devastated if i really did it. i always felt a little anger for people who so readily expressed their desire to die because i know it costs so much for the loved ones of suicide victims. 

but like i said, depression controls you. it makes me think differently about suicide. yes, i would devastate my loved ones by killing myself. but, as insensitive as this sounds, i wouldn’t feel the guilt of hurting them. i’d be dead. besides, they’d overcome it. they would mourn me, miss me, some longer than others, but it wouldn’t kill them. they would learn to be strong and they would finally take me seriously enough learn from my mistakes. i know i have a lot of life ahead of me right now. but do i? “it gets better.” says who? who’s to say it doesn’t get worse? every time i’ve been in a low place, it gets “better” just long enough that i let my guard down. then it gets bad again, seemingly worse each time. i reassure myself sometimes by picturing myself happy, with a family and tons of kids. that’s my dream. but why should i believe that will happen? i can’t make someone fall in love with me. not everyone finds love, and that’s just a fact.

it just seems it’s very possible that i’m suffering like hell right now because i’m holding onto hope that it will get better, when i could just stop."
1,"I was doing so well. I don't know what happened, but this wave of sadness just hit me a few hours ago. I was standing in my kitchen, reheating my dinner and ""I would be better off just killing myself"" ran through my head for the first time I can remember in a long time and it made me so sad. I forgot what this feeling was like and I hate that I'm feeling it.

I've been bad about taking my meds recently, I'm graduating college into a crazy recession, it's taken me 7 years! To get my bachelor's and now I don't even get to walk at commencement. I'm scared i won't get a job once I graduate and then I won't be able to afford therapy and insurance and my medication and the roof over my head and maybe it's all just cumulating because I have a paper due tomorrow that I can't even push myself to write and maybe if I was better, more committed, not such a loser then I could do all these things. I feel like a fraud sometimes.

And I know people are dying and I shouldnt be thinking thoughts like this and people have it way worse than I do rn.

 Any tips to get through the night? I know this feeling will go away but that doesn't help right now."
1,"Depression, punched myself badly (f26). My depression has been really bad lately. I had an argument with my partner and he wouldn't let up for several hours, eventually I couldn't take it and hit myself really hard on my chest and in my face, enough to cause bruising and swelling. I didn't do this in front of him.

I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself for this. I don't know what to think about it."
1,"What the hell am I supposed to do with my life when I don’t want to do anything. I’m gonna graduate highschool in like a month. I already got into college but I don’t know if I even wanna go. College looks like fun but at the same time I don’t know if I would even like it. And I’ll be damned if I’m gonna get a degree so I can work some dumbass 9-5 every day. I don’t wanna work at a pizza place the rest of my life either, which is the job I have now. I don’t wanna have a job at all so how the hell am I supposed to decide what to do with my life? I feel like I could do whatever I want but I don’t want to do anything. 

I just wanna sleep half the day and spend the other half watching tv with my dog or something for the rest of my life. But I live like that now and I don’t like that either so what’s the point"
1,"need help or i lose my graduation project in which my career life depends on .. i m losing my determination to go on. I did pass with many life obstacles throw my young life ( mom being sick since i joined college and my professors and mates was censured me cuz they think i m just lazy while i was always with mom in hospital , i was just trying to deal with that but reality i getting destroyed inside from the first on my class to someone pass her year with prayers .. just it is out of my hands ) which changed me 100% from a strong will-ed person who is really so powerful and clever to someone who depresses her own , i was so clever and i think i still but same time i say i cant .. for wat i need to do my best , I don’t really has this passion to live or feel like i want to do something good even for my own , i did fail many time to be the best cuz i m only scared of failure like a fool , i see ppl around me getting better grades they try hard really to get it and they envy me for having the abilities but i just don’t have the passion for it not anymore , they keep throwing hard words and climb over me with dirty doings and i just keep failing and idc about beating them too , and now it is my graduation project and i stopped working on it cuz of those feelings controlling me .. btw my mom was always sad cuz she has a hand on wot had happened to me and she was forcing me stupidly to do my best which affected me so bad without her notice ( and i never blame her in my deep heart ) , less than month for it and i keep watching anime play video games and cry inside but really it is hard to fight"
1,Has online counseling helped anyone here?. Kind of in a low spot right now and would really like to talk to someone who could help me. I don’t have anyone close to me that I can talk to..
1,I’m callous. Idk why maybe because people and the world suck and this is my way of showing anger. Sometimes I feel like just ending it so there is one less person for everyone to deal with
1,"I can’t tell people I’m sad because I don’t have the right.. I was on the verge of tears and my boyfriend asked me if I was sad because I sounded sad (were in a call, we fall asleep in a call every night.) and I said I was just tired because it’s 1am, it’s believable. In reality, I’m really hurt. I’m really really upset. I just don’t think I have the right to be sad or upset because my life isn’t half as bad as others. My parents are together, they at least act like they care. we’re decently well off so I have a lot of luxuries in life that I know others don’t have. I have an amazing boyfriend. I get a lot of things that I want- to be quite honest I could have easily become spoiled the way I’m growing up. 

I literally do not have the right to be upset. If my life is perfectly fine then I should be too. I feel so worthless - which I also don’t believe I have the right to feel. I don’t have the right to feel any emotion other than happy, yet here I am. I only try to show people me as a happy careless loving person. Yet here I am probably considered fake as fuck because in reality I’m super sad all the time and just can’t show it because I risk losing or hurting people. I’m worthless. Ha. Ha. Ha."
1,"Depression. Ive been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression about 5 months ago and i never really understood what they were or what they feel like snd then the anxiety started coming in and i grew accustomed to it but the depression part was always shady bc ive never really felt happy or unhappy always just neutral but here lately i feel like the depression is really kicking in i have been feeling empty and lack of motivation and really un social and very drowsy alot and i feel like i am breaking apart on the inside. Is this what depression is or is this something else please help me understand what i am going through.
Edit: i am a 17 year old male who has always struggled with displaying emotion if that is any significant information."
1,"Slipping into drugs but don’t want to leave. So I’m gonna keep this short and sweet. Been smoking weed and drinking alcohol for 2-3 years to cope with shit. Has it really helped? No. Will I/ can I stop? Also no. And this virus shit hasn’t helped. School was the only thing keeping me productive and now the only time I get up is to get more drugs. I have now tried many other drugs, basically anything except coke, meth, and heroin. 2 days ago I was walking around my neighborhood, tripping on dxm and weed when I ran into a garbage can. I fell on the ground and didn’t get up for 30 minutes straight, wallowing in my own self pity. Just wish something else was worth doing."
1,I hate myself so much and I feel so lonely all the time. I haven’t felt like this in so long. I smoked tn when I probably shouldn’t have and now everything I have kept bottled up for months have just come back. I can’t talk to anyone because I can’t get myself to be comfortable to open up with anyone even my girlfriend who I don’t deserve. This quarantine has made it all worse because this is my senior year of high school and surrounding myself with friends has always been a distraction whether it’s at school or just hanging with my friends. Now I’m alone all the time and all I have are these sad thoughts. I don’t know what’s gonna happen when everyone goes to college and I’m stuck in my hometown at community college. I’m gonna be so lonely. I just want to truly be happy without these sad thoughts in the back of my head all the time
1,"I'm starting to get real fuckin drained from talking to people every day. ... but these are my friends and I feel horrible to keep telling them I can't talk rn/ sorry I'm really tired/ etc as it feels selfish.

Why is this on the depression forum? I have previously gone through several month long depressive periods and in fact just got out of one in February! But now I feel tired all the time, can't get out of bed, can't do basic productive tasks, worst of all I just feel so irritated when I hear a human voice.

I have never found myself self isolating before. Maybe because I have never had this many people close to me. It feels good to have friends. I don't want to just shrug them off.

Advice? Ty for reading."
1,Can’t even isolate in peace. My life is terrible I have no friends no irl friends for months and my online friend cut contact with me not sure y I’m completely alone the worst part is that I can’t isolate in peace my mom and her boyfriend had a fight he started with me saying he was going to fight me for no reason lasted all day cops were called and because of the virus they can’t kick him out he knows this and abuses it saying more things constantly trying to get me out I went to my dads for the week too more fighting it’s driving me insane I can’t even feel safe In either house virus shut down my job nor money to move out I have no one and it’s hard I don’t want to get up to hear more fighting or I am woken up to it I’m losing myself and my thoughts have gotten darker each day I thought I wanted no school but it’s the only thing that got me away from home now I’m stuck and I can’t deal with it anymore I’m the fight my step dad destroyed my pc I o my have my phone and no other way to take my mind off things there only so much you can do on your phone honestly I don’t think I’m going to make it out of quarantine
1,"I am splitting at the seams and I can't do anything about it.. I am breaking apart and I am constantly on the verge of either screaming in anguish or crying and I have no control over my life right now. Usually that excuse is bullshit but I have lost any control over my life with this pandemic and it's hurting me. My college shut down and I don't have the resources to do it online at home but they don't give a fuck so I will just fail, my job has cut my hours and I can't see the few friends I do have because no one is allowed out. My life is shit and it is putting me in a hole and now I can't do anything about it. I don't know what to do and I'm so tired of waiting for the day when it will be better and I can do fucking do something that will make a difference."
1,"""I'm good."" I say with a smile.. Is what I do everyday at work when my coworkers ask me how I am. What I really want to say is that I've been seriously depressed for the last few weeks if not months. I don't remember.

I thought I was getting better. I've lost over 150 pounds. I look good. I get hit on and flirted with a lot. I have someone falling for me, I'm falling for her. Yet, I don't feel good. 

I'm not happy, but I should be. Everything in my life is going great. College, work, my relationships. But, I feel so insecure about life. I'm afraid of losing it all and just having it come crashing down on me. 

I don't want these feelings anymore. Why am I experiencing these feelings so strongly. It's as if life's ocean is crashing into my soul and I can't seem to escape the current. 

I'm drowning. But I don't want to reach out, I don't want to push all of the people in my life away from me. I'm scared of losing them, of losing her, and she's not even mine. 

So I'll just keep saying ""I'm good"" and I'll smile. And I'll keep making them laugh, making her laugh and smile and bring happiness into all of my family and friends life, because they deserve it.

I'm okay with drowning in my thoughts, and thinking that one day I'll be happy, waking up next to the love of my life. But I know deep inside that I'll never be good enough for anyone."
1,"Not wanting to eat, and my mom is only fueling a relapse into my (self-diagnosed) ED.. Because of quarantine, I haven't eaten as much as usual. Mostly just because I'm not at school with friends anymore so I don't have to worry about someone asking me why I don't eat. I also just don't like the food at home. Im not spoiled, but with depression I ALREADY don't want to eat, but I'm even less likely to eat if the food is something I dislike. Every now and then I have these phases where I just seriously don't want to eat anything. Nothing related to an ED necessarily, but I'm just too depressed to bother to get up and eat. I would rather go through the headaches and stomach pains then just make myself some food.

&#x200B;

However, yesterday I also weighed myself. I was kind of curious as to what my weight was, because honestly I felt like I had gained weight more than anything with all the junk I had been eating the rare times I did eat. I had lost weight, and I weighed myself again today after not eating anything and I weighed 2 pounds less than yesterday (I know it's not actual weight, just not having any water in my body). I only weigh myself when I want to lose weight (which, considering I'm already underweight isn't a very good thing). It starts small, unconsciously weighing myself and then next thing you know I'm googling the quickest way to lose weight or browsing on pro-ana Tumblr pages.

&#x200B;

It is currently 9:30 PM, my mom called me into her room to ask whether I was going to make me something to eat. I have not eaten all day, so you would think she'd be happy with me eating something... A week ago I recall her saying ""Well, at least you're eating"" when I told her about the sliders I made. I was NOT making something to eat, all I did was take some fries (LITERALLY only 5 of them) made earlier today by someone in the house out of the fridge. I didn't even bother to heat up the fries because she'd hear the microwave and get pissed off. Whenever I eat at night (for me, 8-10 is a normal time for me to eat), she tells me I'm going to get ""big and fat"" for eating at night. She thinks anything after 5 is too late to eat. I know I'm not going to, and I know Im not fat, but her words are like a little fucking depression cloud where you know it's not true but for some reason you still feel bad. I had eaten one fry before she had talked to me. After she talked to me, I went back into my room, was about to eat another fry, and then stopped myself and just cried. I don't even know why. I just cried.

&#x200B;

She's been doing this since I was a child and I'm so fucking sick of it. I remember being 7 and waking up to make a PB&J sandwich (I've been underweight and struggling to eat my whole life)... It was maybe 11 PM, and she told me I'd get fat for eating at night. It was a PB&J sandwich and I was 7, who says that to a kid? Do you know how much I weighed when I was 7? Less than 40 pounds. A normal 5 year old weighs 40 pounds and I didn't even hit 40 until I was 10 and well into my first year of puberty. I'm so tired of her projecting her insecurities on me. She's overweight, not me. She'd rather have me go a day without eating than to eat at 9 PM and that's fucking insane.

&#x200B;

I want to get up and go eat, just to spite her. But I feel too bad and insecure to do so. I want to eat the 4 fries still sitting next to me, but I cry any time I even think about it. I had a little impulse to go download Tumblr again and browse the pro-ana shit a few minutes ago. Usually I don't think about what or if I'm going to eat the next day or not, I don't plan it. But I genuinely don't even know if I'm going to want to eat tomorrow either. Part of me wants to start intentionally not eating again. I know it's bad, but I just can't get the thoughts out of my head."
1,"Anyone else wish they could catch Covid-19 and die from it?. I've  been thinking about committing suicide for a long time. The one thing  that's always stopped me from taking a kitchen knife and slicing myself  open, and watching the blood spurt out like a *Kill Bill* film, is knowing what people would think of me. My family and friends would know I couldn't hack it and was a disappointment.

But now, Covid-19 has come on the scene.

Dying  from coronavirus is a blameless death. No-one can call you a failure  for catching it, it's a virus that strikes the poor and rich, the Tom  Hanks and the Baldricks of the world alike. And compared to suicide, the  loneliest of deaths, dying from Covid-19 is a merciful, beautiful  death.

Compare with dying because I  deliberately overdosed on my antidepressants: and being found four  weeks later by the custodian crowbarring my door open because the  neighbours complained of a mysterious overpowering stench caused by my  badly decomposing corpse (the place where I lay leaving a dark stain on  the carpet that no amount of scrubbing can remove, and which the tenants  that moved in after me do their best to try to ignore).

Meanwhile,  with Covid-19, I'd be surrounded by doting doctors and nurses fussing  over me, applying balms and soothing salves to my skin. My mother and  father would Zoom in to cry over me and call me a poor thing as I drew  my last breaths on a ventilator, and ascend to heaven under the angelic,  white light of fluorescent hospital filaments.

Where  I live, New Zealand, is one of the few states not majorly affected by  coronavirus (we have 9 deaths so far). With so few deaths, each person  that passes away gets a full spread on the newspapers and wall-to-wall  coverage on the TV for a week about their life story and interviews with  their grieving relatives. My death, if it was by Covid-19, would be  remembered, and my life would have mattered. As a young lad in my 20s,  my death would be used to save lives. I'd be used by the media as a  wake-up call to young people that even they can die from this silly flu,  and that they should stay at home. Then, many years hence, I would be  remembered as one of the honored martyrs that sacrificed their lives to  Covid-19. Every year, in April, there would be a nationwide memorial  service where the names of all those that died of coronavirus would be  read out, and fresh lilies and white doves released by my gravesite.

Covid-19: could anyone wish for a more beautiful death?

Please,  if there is a higher power on this Earth. I entreat you. I pray to you.  Please let me contract Covid-19 and die from it, so I don't need to  commit suicide and die a shameful, sinful, solitary, lonely death."
1,I want to be depressed. So I am in a weird situation where I don't want to get out of my depression. What if I actually enjoy life and somehow it is cut short. That means I'm actually going to miss it during my final moments. But by being depressed I can die anytime without feeling any regrets or sadness. Does anyone feel this way or is it just me?
1,"If you didn't make your best friends in highschool or college you're screwed. Or at least that's what it feels like. And I don't mean just making like ""friends"" or acquaintances, I mean good friends that you always want to hangout with. Those take a lot of time, you have to hangout a lot to build that type of relationship and nobody has time to do that anymore when you're an adult it seems. All I want is a group of friends to go on a roadtrip with. Or go to the beach with. I just keep comparing myself to my ex and his group of friends, and others I've met through him. They all have a group of two or three people who they do all this fun stuff with. But anytime I meet or see anyone with a group, its always people they've met in highschool or college. I don't understand, isn't there others like me? Why can't I find anyone that i really click with. "
1,"I invested everything I had into a partnership that came to a brutal end. I have very high expectations of myself and I've struggled to fulfil them. I have two, now three athletic careers to look back at that ended in failure just before I reached the goals I had respectively pursued for years with 100% dedication, training 15-20 hours a week.

I'm over thirty now and my last shot of making it was taken away from me because my partner (non romantic) decided that what I was delivering wasn't good enough. Our coaches thought it was going well but for her it just wasn't enough. I trusted her 100% and she revealed from one day to the next that she didn't see any future in us working together.

Instead of letting me go she kept me around for three months saying that just because she doesn't see a future doesn't mean there isn't any. That made no sense to me but I got so depressed that I just hoped it would somehow work out.

Three months later I finally packed my shit and moved back home. It's so crushing to have somebody you did everything for tell you she accepts that you did everything you could but it just isn't enough.

Instead of giving me a way to save myself she insisted on explaining why it's me that isn't good enough and that's the reason it's not working. None of this ""it's not you, it's me or it's us"" or whatever you say when you try to let somebody down gently. Then I got an email detailing all the shit that's wrong with me. All she wanted was me to validate how she was feeling which was that my best is not enough. How the fuck can she not see how cruel that is?

I had just quit my job to pursue this dream full time but that didn't matter to her either. She refuses to accept that you have some responsibility for the well being of a partner who depends on you. She sees nothing wrong with how she acted because it wasn't her intention to hurt me, just an unfortunate side effect. Hitler also had reasons and in his mind good intentions. That's no excuse.

She also said that I made her quit me by getting injured and being low on energy (because of depression I had just started getting treatment for). Maybe rape is the wrong word but I feel brutally abused and while it was going on I was told that it's my fault and shame on me for making her do that.

I'm usually good at processing breakups but this time I just can't. I got even more severely depressed and I can't get these thoughts out of head. How could she do this to me? Everybody thinks she's nice and a great person. This was my last chance of achieving the greatness I have been dreaming of for 18 years. I've never been this close and now I'm left with nothing. My whole identity has evaporated and now I don't know how to fill the void. There is basically no chance to find a new partner at this level so everything I've worked for is fucked.

To me it feels like failure to get a job and live a ""normal life"". It's not who I want to be but I'm out of options because somebody took my last option from me. Now I'm too old to do what I really wanted to do. Part of me refuses to accept this.

1,"Today is my birthday but..... Today is my birthday, but i honestly hate my birthday and the holidays because of how my family is. My family can't be in a room together without all of us fighting and by the end of it someone is crying (either me or my mom). I remember 1 year where no one remembered except from my mom, not even my dad remembered but with how he is it didn't surprise me. i Just feel horrible today because i also feel like i've accomplished so little in my life because of my depression. I see people posting all their achievements and how they're transferring to the school of their dreams, but with me it's a struggle to even get out of bed. When i try telling people about this they think i'm just making excuses or some of them even say, ""That's life.""  I work with what i have but it just feels like it's never enough. When my depression takes over i'm in my bed in the dark crying and feeling worthless then when i go online i see everyone doing so many great things, even the people who bullied me in high school are living their best lives which makes me feel even worse. I wish things were different but i just feel so stuck. Right now i'm just waiting for the big family fight that's going to happen once dinner is ready."
1,"My girlfriend needs help.. Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. 

Reddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I’d support her no matter what."
1,"Is it really that bad?. Usually I feel really lonely during my day,but lately I haven't felt like that,in fact I don't really miss having someone with me because I already forgot how it felt like to have a friend with me or something like that,all I do is stay in my room all day and feel little to nothing all the time,I don't want to suicide that badly anymore,but still it didn't solve the problem that I can't really live in the reality I am part right now,I am only ignoring the problem"
1,"Hey, I’m not that bad but i want to let you know anybody can change. I have African parents and i always am pushed to do my best, and i do but if it doesn’t work out then i take the fall for something everybody does. Don’t get me wrong i love my parents without them i can’t even stand to look at myself because i know if i was worthless i wouldn’t be put through multiple rounds of being pressured. I play soccer, i’m the best on my team and i carry them to the state cup final every year. But if i lose in a team sport with ten other kids i rely on i’m in trouble. 

I try my best but if your really struggling(i’m not hopefully you aren’t ) you need to speak to a hotline a family member or somebody else.

In all truth i think suicides wrong life can always change, we have one life in infinity, don’t throw it away on this. No matter how scared you are of the reactions it’s better than just leaving forever. I know that’s not what you wanted when u were first born. 

So please whatever’s getting you down can always change. I know that when i get depressed all i do is think about what i want to be i break it down into a plan and have multiple backup strategies in the event of failure. If u make it somewhere i applaud you but if not remember that not everything was done at the first try.

I thank u guys for even reading this i’m signing off for now i hope i can change some lives for the better"
1,"Had to call the suicide hotline tonight. I really don’t want to go into why but I just want to say that they are 100% worth calling. I’ve had so many nights like tonight where the thought creeps in and takes over and calling them rarely crosses my mind and when it does I immediately reject the idea out of denial that it would do any good. Tonight they really helped me. I’m a very sensitive person and need to be spoken to in a specific sort of way and oh my god they did it. Of course I’m not cured of depression or anything but I really needed that reassurance and comfort tonight. If you are ever hesitant to call, just do it. They won’t give you cookie cutter responses like you might be expecting and are definitely worth a try for when you are at your lowest."
1,"Independent. Livng alone sucks so bad. 

I wish I had a healthy family that i could stay with as long as i could.

I moved out when I was 17. And ever since I got my own place it's been nothing but working full time and stress. I feel I have no one and cant shake the feeling of being pushed aside by everyone. I've isolated myself to the point where my only real friend is my ex that left me. I'm such a bother to everyone. I don't wanna start school bc then I'd have to cut my work hours which would stress me out even more, but I'm already 21 and cant put it off anymore. I just wanna leave, I'll never be anything anyway, there's nothing here for me.

I hadn't cut in years but recently I've relapsed so deep to the point I had to get stutures for them, idk what to do

Tl;dr just a late night rant."
1,"BotW. I'll never be anyone, I'll never matter, I'll never BE. Things just ""aren't"" anymore. I've been thinking about self harm and suicide but, I don't wanna hurt my mom. Nothing makes me want to try anymore, before quarantine I used to be so passionate about academics, but online school is murdering me and it takes nearly everything out of me to get it done. I, just want to give up, I only have 2 people who truly care about me, my mom and my best friend Xander, he is the only one who knows I'm depressed and he helps me through things. I'm also just angry at the world and I'm filled with so much hate towards society and people. I don't understand why some nothing like me gets to be a nothing while everyone else is happy, it's not fair. The only things I enjoy anymore are watching Swagkage and SethTheProgrammer (they are Narutubers), play Rivals of Aether with Xander, and play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I just bought the DLC for it and I've been enjoying the new outfits the DLC comes with. Well anyway in the comments don't say ""feel better"" because I know you little retards are just saying it because you feel it will make you morally better, it won't. It doesn't help. Also if you read all the way I don't see why you did. I'm nothing, I don't matter and I can't see why you even bothered to take time out of your pitiful existence to listen to this."
1,I’ve lost myself I don’t know what’s next. It seems I’m nothing and I feel nothing and I try to feel I try but I give up
1,I dont know why im bothering to post this but here is every thing about how i feel right now.

1,"Starting therapy during covid... I’ve come to the realization that I’m depressed and need therapy/maybe medication. I’m open to trying anything. But I’m not sure how to go about trying to find a therapist during this. I looked through my insurance and I have a few therapists I could go to but they’re not offering in person or online therapy. Are there websites or something I could do telehealth therapy on?

I’m out of college so that isn’t an option but I do have insurance."

1,"My mom might push me over the edge.. I’m so tired of being In this house, my mom does pretty much nothing but get in my nerves, I can be completely fine one minute, then she comes In and starts yelling at me for the stupidest reasons, I wish I could say certain words to her but that would make things worse, I was completely fine today, I told her I would do my school work, yet she comes upstairs and yells at me for not doing it, even though I fucking told her I’m gonna do it. Sorry I’m getting off track, but basically I feel fine I e Minute then my mom does something stupid like that, and I just loose it, I loose control of my emotions bc the shit she does to me stresses me out to a point where I have no control over my emotions, I wish I could leave, if anything she’s gonna be the person who makes me end everything, she doesn’t know how to help, she overreacts and is just a bitch most of the time. I wish there was somewhere I could but there isn’t. It’s not like I can leave bc I’m only (male15) but still I want to leave, who know when I’d leave forever, but there’s a chance it’s gets to that point, I’m so tired of the life I life. I only have a few things that actually make me happy. I really don’t understand why my mom does shit like that, it doesn’t help me, it destroys my mental stability, I can’t control myself, and my emotions. Yet I still hide all my emotions from her, bc if I tell her how I feel she won’t help, she won’t know how, she’ll make things worse. I’m so tired of being In this house, I want out, I want to go, I’m want to give up, I have very little left, I can barely see the light at the end of my tunnel. I’m so broken, everyone I talk to says the bad things are temporary, yet I can’t see them letting go anytime soon if ever.all this shit is tearing me apart, I don’t know how to feel anymore, I do t know what to do. I’m want to give up, but I know I would hurt my friends and my family if I did that, but it’s still an idea......"
1,Want to die...... Want to die per usual. Anyone want to help me? I’d like to vent to someone. I’d prefer someone whose understanding/ a good listener. Thanks.
1,"Nobody needs me.. Some days I feel like I'm doing okay and maybe I can deal with this. But some days... fuck me. On top of clinical depression, I have severe anxiety and PTSD.. My family lost our house in January and I moved from FL to AZ to be with my boyfriend and not homeless. But no matter what I do I'm never good enough for my family. I haven't ""sacrificed"" anything in their lives. They constantly remind me of my shortcomings and pick on me and he just begs me to ride it out until we can move our new trailer off their land so I don't have to deal with it anymore. Some days I feel like I can do it. But today.... fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This was a bad day.

I got randomly grabbed out of nowhere on the neck, picked on a little in a fun joking manner but my anxiety took it and ran, and I realized nobody needs me anymore. Nobody. At my home I had 12 pets. 4 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos. I lost 2 of the dogs and 3 of the cats. My leopard geckos are being housed with a friend but they can't take care of them much longer. My remaining dogs and cats, including my service dog, are with a foster mom. Since Coronavirus I lost my job and their trip (that I'm paying for) to me is postponed indefinitely. They've all accepted her as their mom.

My pitbull hated her new collar that I sent her at first because that was the collar she knew with me. But she also had it during 2 trips to the pound (when I adopted her she had it and when my mom dropped her at the pound she kept it before I had a friend readopt her for me as I was already across the country. I paid for it.) Today foster mom tells me she loves the new collar now. The old collar got brought out and she ran from it. She ran. She doesn't need me anymore. None of them do. My service dog accepted foster mom as new home within a week. Pitbull took 2 months but she's finally given up on me. My cats never needed me. I was a fool to think they did. I've never been without pets ever. I'm 19, we always had at least 3 in my household. They're my reason for living. I'm becoming a veterinarian to help them. I've wanted to since I was 9. But they don't need me. I'm useless. And worthless. I can't commit suicide because my instinct to survive is too strong. It's like my brain and heart want to die but my body won't give up on me. I can't bring myself to try. I can't even do that right...

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get some stuff out there to people who will understand."
1,"Feeling Rough. I'm not really sure how to go about this post but I'm feeling rough as hell today. I just want to cry all the time or hit something really hard.

And I’m worried about the corona virus for other reasons and now I heard that my brother got her girlfriend pregnant and they’re 16 and 17 and I don’t know what to do I am freaking out I worry everyday and I am crying and this is stupid but I always say “it I don’t ____ I die” like if I don’t go to the bed in 5 seconds I will die like I’m pretty sure it’s with my ocd or something but it pressures me someone please help

1,"I’m a ghost watching my own life. I’ve talked to therapists. I’m on meds. I’m doing the best I can but I’m stuck. I’m drinking a lot these days (after being sober for months) because it gives me a few hours of disconnection to the numbness. I know that doesn’t help anything but I also want some immediate relief and it’s all I have. I know this pandemic is the reason my depression has escalated to an uncontrollable level but I can’t fill the emptiness. My bf said today “it’s like you’re not fighting”. I am fighting. But it’s like expecting someone who just got their arm cut off to pick up a sword. Someone please, tell me how to keep going. I’m tired all of the time. I’m not suicidal per se, but I’m not alive. I haven’t been for weeks now."

WHY AM I ALIVE"
1,"Just some long ass monologue. Im just tired.  Of every single damn thing.

Of my family, for which Im just a caretaker for my grandma and uncle (her son) for the rest of my fucking life, because nobody else cares about them, and partially I cannot blame them; grandma is not a nicest person to be around most of the time, let's put it this way, and I'm always around since i live with her.

Of my mother, who has been using me for so many years, just so everything will stay HER way. Telling me to cry when dad came home lately and ask him ""why are you not with me and mommy anymore, we're worried"", or to refuse his plushie bear he gave me on the children's day, just 'cause they were separated. Years later, when I run away from dad and went to live with grandma (that was long ago, when she wasn't that way she is now), she often told me how she always missed me and my sister, how she know that dad was manipulating me and ""forgives me"" for things I said when I WAS 7 GODDAMN YEARS OLD. how she went on rehab and was hardly drinking anymore, how she loved me and always would be here for me. And now? Anytime I went to visit her she was always drinking her ass off, making excuses as always. Wanted to intimidate me to cancel my plans to leave my city and move out to the other side of the country, saying that ""If i do it, i won't be having a mother anymore"". And honestly, yeah, she's right. I won't. I don't want a mother who cares so little about her fucking daughter that openly tells that ""she doesn't want to go with me to therapist 'cause she has better things to do and i simulate everything anyway"", and when I tried to open up to her that one goddamn time and told her about my self-harm problems and two suicide attempts, she just shrugged it off and said ""ah, okay, nice"". So, yeah. She's right. I don't have a mother anymore and I honestly don't know if I ever had one.

Of my father, who just... didn't cared then and doesn't care now. Who is able to go arm with arm with me on the street and pretend he don't see me, just to avoid conversation. Who has the balls to text me about ""how he misses us"" and ""how everyone is against him"", and then act like he doesn't know me, my sister, his siblings or his ex wife. But, well, at least he never tried to hide that he don't care.  


Of my sister, who is the only person in my whole family that I'm actually afraid my death would hurt more than a bit. She's just... too pure for her own good. When I couldn't hide that i'm crying she was trying to make a fucking ""memes"" out of random google images, just to make me laugh. And she was actually only one trying to be with me, understand, even tho she's only fucking 10 and i'm, well, a shitty person in general and a lot more shitty older sister. I don't want to push her away, so my death would be less painful for her, but I also don't want her to be hurt in any way, especially not because of me. I don't know what to do.

Of my friends, who just.. I'm too attached to to just leave them like that. I know that they don't care about me that much, that when I die all it will take for them to forget about me is just a couple weeks, but i care about them. If I'm useful to them, if I can help them with their own problems, If i can do anything to make them feel better and have better lives than they have now, I have to fucking do it. Even if that will take years, I want them to be happy. And still... I'm so tired of this perspective and my selfishness. That I can't just end it now, that I HAVE TO keep going for them, to help them overcome their own problems, that I have to keep waiting even for years to finally feel good with myself ending all of this and even though I will always be for them just a third wheel, just this weird girl who they can always talk to when their better friends aren't around.Of me, not being able to handle everything that's going on.

Of my fucking mind not being able to do things properly, care about myself, my future and self-care anymore. Of being too fucked up to even pass my last year of high school. Of not getting over an ended friendship (toxic as fuck, but still) with a girl I can't stop feel something to, even if she had made my mind even bigger mess that it was already, telling me that ""If i want to kill myself that much, then I should do it now, 'cause only thing I deserve is to die alone"", of being unable to hate her, of being too shitty to do anything productive or learn anything useful. Of being always ""not good enough"". Of waiting.

I'm just really tired, that's all."
1,"I am empty and so is my reflection. I am the ember of an old bonfire underneath a new one. I'm surrounded by new logs and oh, how bright they're burning. Nothing interests me more than the logs and how they're structured above me, supporting each other.

Every time I look at a mirror, I either look away in disgust or stare into my own eyes in attempt to find some semblance of a person...but I stare at myself the same way I stare out a window at nothing particular.

Sometimes I think if these lyrics from the song ""Drag"" by the band Low.

""I'm sorry but I can't hold on
It works much better if I let it drag me around

I'm sorry if I'm losing ground
It works much better if I let it drag me around""

I think the lyrics mean that life's much easier and comfortable with no discipline of the mind...just letting your negative feelings drag you around."
1,I deserve this. I deserve to feel the pain and the tears because I’ve caused people just as much pain and tears.
1,I will never fall in love again so what’s the point. I can’t get over my ex and I don’t think I’ll ever love again so really what’s the point of living. I don’t know what to do anymore.
1,"How to ask for help?. My boss is very kind and personal. She’s always notices when I’m not as lifted as usual and checks in with me. It makes me think she somehow knows what I deal with.

She’s the only person I feel comfortable reaching out to right now but I don’t know if it’s appropriate or if there’s a point. I can’t imagine there’s anything she can actually do for me. I don’t even know what I’m hoping for. I really want help but I don’t want it to just be a venting session where I’m putting my pain onto her. 

Would appreciate any feedback on experiences with confiding in your boss and how I should go about it (if I should). Thanks. 

Also, I am trying to seek medical support (therapist, medication, etc), but not many doctors are taking patients due to the pandemic."
1,"Random Worry 1/of many. I get worried and paranoid sometimes, since I'm easily trusting of certain things or just easily scared. Last year(September 15,2019) there were so many memes I saw in the internet (yes, I know is dumb. I get informed of everything through there-_-) about this one asteroid that was said to hit the Earth and destroy humanity. I was so paranoid and was never calm because of that. I would cry all the time, thinking how I wasted my years being introverted and never doing anything that would leave my mark in the world. It was said to kill us all in October 3rd. Everytime a day passed, I would cry and just regret my life choices, thinking I didn't have time for anything. I was worried of dying from something else that wasn't myself. I didn't like the idea of something or someone else hurting me, since I already did that. When the said day came, nothing happend. So I took that chance to actually get moving in making my mark. I became more confident because I didn't want to waste any time mopping around."
1,"I struggle with the thought that I'll be something to someone, because I never have been (other than my immediate family). All I've ever wanted in my life was to be something to someone other than my mom and dad and sister

I've never had a girl interested in me, and at the age of 28, I feel like a failure to my parents. Every time I walk past them I know they're thinking ""why is he alone?"" ""why doesnt he have a girlfriend?"" ""When is he going to get married?""

And once they're gone, I'll lose the only thing in my life that ever cared about me. I dont know what I'll do then.

How do I tell them I cant do any of those things? How do I tell them I'm going to die alone and a failure, as a man and as a son?"
1,"I am not sure if I am suicidal or attention-hungry. A couple of months ago, I (F19) tried to kill myself. I took around 20 aspirin and sort of kept to myself the whole day. I didn't tell anyone and was hoping maybe I could drift away in my sleep. Although I had painful chest pains for the next couple of days, I did not die obviously. But I kind of knew it wouldn't work. These aspirins were low strength and only 20 would not do it. I knew that I think. I don't understand why I did it. I didn't tell anyone because I feel that it would disingenuous and make them feel bad for no reason.

I don't know if something is wrong with me. From all of this, it sounds like there definitely is. But I am relatively normal aside from my depressive episodes. I like getting dressed up, have hobbies, care about things and people. I do find myself drifting away from life a bit, but at the end of the day, I still do normal things and behave normally. I've thought about killing myself numerous times and this time was the closest I ever got.

I wrote a suicide note if that's important. I did not say bye to any of my friends over text or on the phone. In fact, I refrained from talking to them.

I don't want to treat this as therapy lol. I just don't know if I'm rational and sane right now honestly. I feel that my actions might've come from a desire to manipulate my friends and family."
1,"Just wanted to share my story.. I live in a small apartment near my campus since the first time I enrolled in. I usually went home by train every 2 weeks to meet with my parents and asking me about my college progress. But it was then, when I seems to be enjoy my college life at the first semesters. At that time, my grades were relatively good, in my 6 courses each semester I got 2 A's, 3 B's and a D in calculus (I'm sucks at math, and my math lecturer sucks too.

The second semester my grades were still good, with one D again in math. The third semester again was still good with no D's.

Then the fourth semester is the beginning of my end. My depression starts here and I slowly lose interest in going to college, there's one lecturer that is hated by all students in my major, he gives us quizzes and homeworks every single week and I got an E in that particular subject. I mostly got many C's from now on and rarely B. 

Then came the 7th semester when things get worse than ever. My friends slowly moving away from me, they left me behind when doing group projects, they no longer responding me in group chats. I feel like I'm a horrible and shameful mess.

Now I'm in the 8th semester, and the next May will be my 9th. But with all my shitty grades with many C's and D's, and some E's I doubt that I will get thru it. I can't even think clearly, my mind is full of dark clouds with heavy thunderstorms raining shit. Then the corona came, and now I live in my parent's apartment with my sister. I even forgot to pay my tuition fee and will likely to be extra charged. I don't even join my online classes.

My parents ask me the same things, the college, plus the internship program and thesis that will happen in 9th and 10th semester respectively. I don't know how to answer them questions like at what place you'll take internship at? or how's the thesis? My grades are shit, and I will likely to retake my bad grades till next year. But how do I tell them? They keep pushing me and tell me about it. Now I got the email from my parents that my internship and thesis are swapped so my thesis should be in 9th semester. And I don't know what things to write that shit because I skipped classes.

I began suicidal at the end of my 4th semester. Until now, I don't tell to my parents yet because I know it will hurt them feelings. I'm starting to overdose my sleeping pills with hope that I'll sleep forever before I'm turning 21 at the end of this month. I can't jump off my room in 25th floor."
1,"My father is going to die.. He's only 45. But been a heavy drinker since he was younger than me. I'm a 19 male in university. Few years ago his doctor said he had to quit drinking completely, his liver had a lot of scar tissue. Since then he's had phases where he lightened to beer, quit for maybe a month, but overall he hasn't really quit. Recently he's been drinking a lot because, he's a small business owner in Canada. Small businesses here have some infamy with tax evasion and the current government has decided to finally cut down on it. He was caught and has had troubles/problems since he got a big bill in the mail from the Canadian revenue agency. Which has had him drinking a lot more heavily the last 5 months.

Well, his feet are extremely swollen. Google says a common cause of this is liver Cirrhosis and the fluid just reaches the feet from gravity (he stands pretty much all day). Many people in my family has died of this. Everyone in his family has alcohol problems.

Liver cirrhosis is the 3rd most common cause of death for ages 45-65. He did it to himself.

I don't really have anyone to talk to. I've been an asshole and a bully all my life. It's my fault I know. I just yeah i don't know so I guess posting on a subreddit is something to do."
1,"The Biggest Thing Stopping me from Getting Help. I'm not sure the best way to word this, but the biggest thing that is stopping me from trying to fix my mental health is the fear of what it would be like to not have a mental disorder. Someone put it this way once and it really resonates with me, 

""You know what the sick thing is, I don't even want to get better, because I'm scared of that too. This is  all I know. I don't remember being happy, I don't remember peace with myself"".

&#x200B;

How do I try to fix this mindset because it is honestly tearing me apart and has been for a while and I really need to fix my mind if I'm going to do anything with my life"
1,"Well, got through another day.. So sick of just “getting through” my day’s. I want to feel accomplished, which I don’t even if I manage to keep the house decently clean and keep my daughter happy. I wake up feeling blah and go to bed feeling the same."
1,"Parents. My parents were in and out of my life and for the most part I was raised by my grandparents. My grandparents would pick me up from school during my very early elementary school years up to high school. I was always at their house early in life and when I got to high school they would come over everyday. In high school was when I never saw or spoke to my parents. When I was in high school and when my dad was able to drop me off at school, we never spoke to each other. Nothing was said from the time that I woke up to getting into his car to leaving. The most that he would say was “I’ll be in the car!” He was always on and off unemployment which sucked because my mom was in school and working a full time job. My dad would just complain that they were spending too much money on my education and kept asking me if I wanted to go to the local public school, not understanding the value of a private school education.  Though they all took turns parenting me, I was always distant with all of these family members. I remember coming home everyday, depressed just lying on the couch putting on the news everyday, just in my own little world. My grandma would come over to just do the dishes and leave. My mom wasn’t going to do the dishes after working day and night everyday and my dad didn’t want to do them. Whenever I tried talking to my mom she would ignore me, always stressed from having the workload and responsibility that she had. When she is stressed she shuts down. After awhile I gave up on my relationship with my mom. If she doesn’t want to talk to me she dosent have to to. But that’s the last person in people’s lives that they would expect to not regularly engage with them. I felt so alone, abandoned. I was late to school everyday, ate the same food and sat at a lunch table that I knew wouldn’t judge me. I wouldn’t always talk. 

I just don’t understand why my parents weren’t always there for me. They have since apologized but it’s too late. They want me off of my meds but I just want to scream at them and tell them that you did this! I don’t want to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It was your genes that I inherited and there were certain events that happened where you could have been there for me but since I had no one, I blamed myself for everything.  I had no one to combat those suicidal thoughts.  Where were my parents when I needed them? This could have been addressed so long ago but it’s now that you are concerned about my mental health? I’m depressed now and they have no idea. They were the most controlling parents growing up and I feel like my freedom would be threatened if I talked to them. Saying that it’s in the past dosent change anything. I feel too proud to ask them for any help. I hired my psychiatrist and therapist for that. I wouldn’t want them to help me. I would never see my room again. They would be trying to talk to me the entire day but I’m a very reserved person. Just seeing my dad triggers me."
1,"Quarantine and depression.. Ever since this whole COVID-19 thing broke out and people began to quarantine themselves, I've been fucking depressed. 

It began with an ""Oh, no..."" when I read the email from my university that school would be closed until MAY THE 31ST. Now, I am not exactly sure that I am depressed (am I depressed or just ungrateful?) but I do not at at all bode well with staying alone at home with absolutely nothing to do. There is slow internet, my computer isn't great with running games, and going outside is, of course, out of the question. 

It's almost been a month of waking up, doing nothing, going to sleep. One can watch TV shows for only so long. 

I've been depressed for almost three years now. Depressed in the sense that I have no real ambitions, passions or physical skills that can help me out. I also have this feeling that I will never be ""somebody"". To top it all off, I've been extremely underweight for my age, have been shamed by peers since grade 1, and generally have never had a moment to look back on with pride. 

I am 23 and live with my parents. I have not told them about my depression, they simply would not get it. I don't blame them, no matter how and what they've done, they're the best parents anyone could've asked for. But the problem is me. I feel unimportant. Irrelevant. I just fucking miss going to uni because it was an escape from doing nothing. 

I don't know, whatever. Just wanted to rant it all out."
1,"Why do I self sabotage?. I have struggled with depression on and off since I was in middle school, I'm 31 now.  It seems to come and go in waves and sometimes I'll be super depressed for months, then things will be better out of nowhere.  I got diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a little over a year ago and have been on medications. I'm not very good at taking them though and have gone periods of time not on them. Why do I do this? Also I feel better when I am around people and out of the house, but even before all this crap that's going on now, there would be times where I would avoid everyone and get depressed. I've been in the mental hospital twice and I'm scared I'll end up back in there again if i can't figure this crap out and stop self sabotaging."
1,"It doesn't matter what i do, people will always be disappoited.. My mental health is deteriorating more and more every day, and all i want to do isdrown myself in alcahol and sleep. My life is not going to improve soon, in fact, i think that it will never improve. I'm a disappoitment to my parents, i'm a disappoitment to my friends and even to myself. Every good thing that happened in my life i've found a way to destroy it. I'm only 17 but i'll probably be dead before i hit 25. I Just can't live with myself, i have a relatively good life and that's only makes me hate myself even more because i have no real reason to be like this. I don't wanna think anymore, and the only way to stop my head is to pass out or kill myself. Sorry if i misspelled something, english is not my native language and i'm not sober"
1,"I'm losing motivation. I dont want to do anything productive anymore. I used to beleive that i have a bright future but I've fucked it.

Its my fault as well none of this is normal every day life stuff that you cant do anything about its all my fault. I want to work harder but I just feel like I can't. I hate it. I want to be successful but because of my stupidity I'll never be that.

I'm the very definition of a low life. Average grades stays at home all the time (I'm online schooled) not healthy. I tell myself 'oh i can just wait and fix it later!' The truth is I never will. 

The only thing I need is motivation to work harder. Motivation other than getting done just so i can do fuck all."
1,Im not getting better.. How fucking long will my fucked psyche take to fix itself. Im still a fucking mess after like 2-4 years ( im not sure how much time has passed ). Im not going anywhere. I like someone who doesnt like me back. I cant get anything done exept sit and do nothing. Ik really starting to reconsider my options here.
1,"I'm sorry I can't stop thinking. I've suffered abuse all my childhood: sexual, physical and emotional.  In the last few years I've been recovering from what happened to me, but I realized that it's a long path because the abuse only stoped when I was 17 and now I'm 20. Recently my anxiety has been through the roof and I don't know why. It's gotten so bad that I physically want to slam my head against a wall to stop thinking. I'm tired of being overwhelmed and I'm pretty sure my fiance and those around me are tired of dealing with me. I don't want to be a burden and I just want to get better. Thank you for listening and please leave some advice. I'm in therapy, but I don't think it's working....I hate taking medication."
1,"Is it normal for depression to come and go?. I have been questioning if I actually have MDD for a very long time because my mood constantly changes (like a bipolar person). I could be suicidal one week and fine the next week. The cycle repeats continuously. I don’t think I actually had a manic episode though. During the times when I am not depressed, I get really anxious. When I’m anxious, it’s very hard for me to sleep and have more energy but I don’t think that’s mania because it’s also a symptom of anxiety. A year ago, I suspected that I had bipolar and my psychiatrist told me that it doesn’t sound like bipolar to her and convinced me that it’s MDD. She has been medicating me on antidepressants for years which aren’t even that affective. So yeah, I am not certain of my diagnosis and thinking of getting a second opinion."
1,"HELP. HELP

I'm turning 13 soon and I'm not ready at all. today I broke my record and had 3 mental breakdowns in one day today and I constantly feel like I could collapse at any moment I'm not ready for this honestly I just feel like a waste of space and I spent the whole day pacing from my open window and considering jumping out to my bed or trying to forget that I'm turning 13. I still accidentally say I'm 9 sometimes when I introduce myself and don't feel ready or mature enough or whatever to be turning 13.I've already been sorta diagnosed with depression (It's complicated and I constantly have doubts that I'm faking it but fakers don't cut and consider suicide so AAA)  without oversharing more that I already have I am completely lost  and somebody please help"
1,"First post. Hi im a 17 yr old guy and i dont really know where else to turn to, everyones shut me out, my therapist wont see me and im going fucking crazy. I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything i havent been sleeping because i only have fucked up dreams. Nothing feels real whenever someone tries to talk to me i have extremely bad dissociative episodes that last anywhere from 20-30 minutes. My dad and his girlfriend treat me like 2nd class as if im not worth anything and im just so sick of it im so tired of trying to be a normal fucking person this is all just too much for me to handle half the time i dont feel anything then the other half my emotions are controlling me. I feel like the empty shell of what used to be a person. People kept trying to bite away at me and leech off me to get what they want out of me but its happened to persistently that theres nothing left to take i feel like i died a long time ago and im in hell now. I cant even cry theres no tears left. I dont know what to do."
1,"i feel so pathetic. never good with words, but depressions just completely killed me. My friend killed herself way back in August and even now, it still hurts thinking about it, even reading old messages just makes me feel awful, people around me tell me to get better and forget but it just feels like it never happens. It just never feels like it gets any better, even today I still miss them so much even when it feels like I shouldn't."
1,"People bitching about quarantine are making me more depressed.. I've been disabled for a little over five years. In that time I have hardly left my house because I have no money. When I first stopped working people kept telling me how 'lucky' I was to stay home. But this quarantine is exactly what my life has been like for 5 years. No chance to go out, nobody coming to visit. Just quiet loneliness. Not so 'lucky' now, am I? Real fun being trapped in your house all the time, eh? WHAT A FUCKING VACATION. 

Suck it up people. You only have to last a month or two. This is the rest of my life.

Edit: words."
1,"How do people exist. There’s probably something utterly wrong with me but the thought of living my life sucks. I’m trying to maintain positivity but it’s hard. You have to work to get money, and jobs suck. I personally have no interests in anything and the thought of having to talk to people and have fake conversations just to get by in that career. Idk my life is just so unentertaining and I’m wondering if other people feel this way too or if it’s just me.

I didn’t focus on grammar or anything so don’t judge."
1,"What's the point...?. What's the point of trying to ""get better"" if your past has already robbed you of your future? Everything you could/should have been, now a fleeting dream as you wasted your years wallowing in misery. Do you even try to salvage that shit heap? Just for a lame, mediocre outcome that you know you'll never be proud of?

Tried getting a normal person to understand that and you know their response? ""Kill yourself."" (And they were quite adamant about it.) Funny how they think. But I guess if you don't fit in with the crowd or share their worldview, you'll be cut off like a malignant tumor. Nature's way, I suppose. At least I can feel accomplished that I got someone to see things my way for a change, even if they weren't exactly willing to accept it. And it's not that I nor anyone else with depression *wants*  to feel or think the way we do. It's just how it is, as fucked up as it is..."
1,Depression...... I’ve been struggling with depression for 2 years now is there anyone I could talk or have any ideas on how to overcome?
1,"I can’t shake the feeling I’m a horrible person. I’ve done bad things in the past and I’ve tried to make up for them and the people I’ve affected say they forgive me but I know I’m a bad person.
My friends all disagree with me but my parents don’t.
I try to be as nice and accepting to everyone as much as I can but I’m annoying and people have told me I give off a toxic energy.
How do I become a good person?"
1,Today I feel....normal.. Depression....wow it has run rampant. I know I have it and once in a great while I wake up and I can think. I can breathe. I can feel. I'm more myself than I have been in years. Today was a day of enjoying existing. I attempted to get shit done. It didn't work like I planned but that's ok. I'm even ok with my recent breakup. I always want to feel this way. The brain cloud is gone. How do I maintain?
1,"If I am an introvert it sucks. This quarantine made me realise how much time I was wasting during my best years. And I still do that. I had so many similar days in the past when no one forced me to not go out and I still locked myself in without feeling the wind or the sun for days. I have lost so many days by just looking at the ceiling, getting late on purpose, looking at stupid crap videos on internet or lame celebrity news. I feel so bad. I feel like I'm constantly wasting time with non important things but in the same time I cannot do anything productive. Untill now, whenever I stayed hours after waking up, getting late on purpose and trying to continue a dream or just hiding under my blanket and trying to postpone the moment I have to get up, I thought it's because I had to go somewhere and have a responsibility. But now I don't have to do anything and I am still frightened. I have to do some work and I have deadlines but at least I don't have to leave the bed to do it. Or to meet people. And I still get that anxiety every morning even if I'm all alone and I can make my own schedule. 
 It's like two persons inside me fighting constantly. The one that wants me to be productive and do all the things I've postponed because I said I don't have time and the one that wants me to stay away from everything and just don't use my brain at all. It's been almost 2 months since I am in quarantine and I wasted my time completely. 
I hate this shit."
1,"Social distancing is killing me. While I consider myself very fortunate that I have a friend I can be 100% myself with, it's killing me that I can't see him. I also feel like he deserves a better friend than me, so I'm hesitant to reach out when I really him. I've been staying with my family -- whom are very loving -- throughout this COVID-19 bullshit, but I'll never feel comfortable enough with them to be honest about my mental health. I feel like a ticking timebomb with no relief."
1,"Who else?. Who else thinks biological life is just bullsh* and unfrair. I mean, I was depressed as a teen the whole time and then lager I improved myself and know how I can actually be happy.
BUT. I still think life in general sucks and has the most unfair and illogical things that if a God would exist, I would give him a soft smack for, like dude what the heck man..
I can love life but at the same time passionately hate it.
Like I was born with a neurological disadvantage called autism, yes I am very thankful that I found out about the gaps diet no plants and actually I am recovering so much mentally. But I still have little energy and just life in me like what the heeeeeeck. Why is this biological life so hard???
I just don't understand anymore and Im just damn mad because I hate being autistic and it gets me almost nowhere because it makes you slow.
Going so crazy right now like how am I even supposed to be thankful??? I mean yes I can litteraly make a list of 100 things right now but the feeling of irritation everyday just always takes over?


How???¿?

Sorry needed to vent.."
1,"Feel worse after depression medicine?. I had a strange experience today. My job was getting me down as usual, so I took my prescribed depression medicine. I know it won't kick in til later, and I have to take it regularly. Still, taking the medicine initially gives one a 'chill', kind of relaxing feeling.

Not this time.

Instead, I felt three times worse, to the point I started crying. I honesty don't understand this reaction, I've never reacted like this to any depression medicine. What's going on with me?"
1,"I dont like my friends. I dont know any other way to say this. I just dont like my friends anymore. I’ve wanted to change as a person and I think that they’re holding me back. I’ve just known them for so long and it would be a really scummy thing to do to just leave.

I don’t know what to do. I feel like a terrible person for thinking this. How should I go about solving this?"
1,"TRIGGER WARNING (sexual assault, drugs, Suic*de, S*lf h*rm, Eating disorders) it's really long sorry lol. recently I've been having a lot of issues with some less than fun memories.

**Sexual assault below** 

I was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade I was 11, maybe 12 at the time, it was in public by a peer and I knew other people who watched it happen but no one did or said anything so I did the same and at the time I never felt like it hadn't hurt me or anything, I didn't see my body any differently I didn't blame myself, nothing, I just passed it off and moved on with my life and that was fine...

**Drugs below**

But eventually I kinda thought about it and it all came crashing down, the realization of how much it actually did hurt me but I pushed it all deep down as a reflex and had no clue I was even doing it, as first I tried to get my mind off it with drugs, mainly weed, and at the lowest point when I was going to give up on myself, LSD, now for the average, healthy, responsible adult both drugs wont cause any physical damage as long as it was done in a safe place but both drugs were done when I was between 12 and 13 and only 2 or 3 I did drugs was I in a safe place and luckily the time I did LSD I was at least unable to hurt myself and didn't want to hurt others but I was at school.

**suic\*de below**

The day I did LSD I planed to go home that night and commit suic\*de but when I arrived at school a friend asked if I wanted to do LSD I said yes because I figured ""what do I have to lose?"" I was coming down from my high as I went home and by the time I arrived I was exhausted and ended up sleeping all day and into the next morning and had missed my only chance for months to come.

 **s\*lf h\*arm below**

So I moved onto the next coping mechanism I could think of which was self harm but after almost being caught time and time again, constantly needing to clean blood covered things, and my familys growing suspicion I had to give that up too which I wish I could say was for the best.

**eating disorder below**

The last thing I tried before I shoved the memory into the deepest part of my mind was to get a grip, have control over the one thing I could, what I ate, I knew right away that I wanted to starve myself unlike most stories of anorexia it didn't start as a diet, it started as eating as little as I could physically get away with, I managed to get down to 89 pounds before I passed out after not eating or 4 days whilst still burning over 2,000 calories a day with my active life style, sadly no one noticed do to the fact that I had told the only person that was home I was going to take a shower moments before passing out on my bed room floor luckily I wasn't out for very long and I was so scared by it that I ate right away and have been trying to get better for years but I keep relapsing.

I bring this up because the memory has resurfaced and I don't know what to do with it"
1,"Self Care. How many others struggle with self care? 
Due to this quarantine and school being out, I can’t work so my self care is even worse lately. 
I’ve been in the same clothes for 4 days. I feel so disgusting yet I have absolutely no motivation to even get up and change and take a shower. 
I hate this."
1,Does anyone ever feel so angry about something or someone. But you have no control over it and then you just hate yourself for not being able to do something about it. Not the only reason why I have depression but I’ve found that it is one of the triggers.
1,"do you avoid people online aswell as real life?. I used to have plenty of friends in real life, then I just stayed indoors all day to avoid everyone including family. I also had 100s of friends online but now just appear offline and only have a few friends who I speak to a few times a month but we dont do anything together, I pref people that do there own thing and speak nonsense sometimes.

I lost all my interests in real life+online and only stick to 1 game and music and haven't taken care of my health in 12 years. I can just sit here doing NOTHING and thinking about shit all day aswell."
1,"Do you think shoulders pain is the result of depression?. Many times I feel pain or pressure on my shoulders, like 6 days a week. Some days it got worse like I carried the whole damn world on my shoulders and nothing can help it goes away. 

I wonder if this is because of depression or not. What do you think?"
1,"Conflicted. Yo, currently conflicted between what feels like two worlds.

I'm trying to figure a way to give my life a meaning, because I'm currently stuck with ""if I did that, then it means that I'd lie to myself. I'd be living a lie that I, myself created. For the purpose of not feeling depressed anymore, wouldn't I fall back to the hole I dug myself in when the time comes?""
So for the time being, life doesn't have meaning.

I've always hated feeling emotions, some 20 odd years later and I'm still ""discovering"" new ones that I've seemed to ignore and suppress.
Still wondering if there is a way to shut them down, see if that's better. Managed a few times, but it's not consistent and not long enough for me to wonder if I could be like that for the rest of my life. 
To be frank I sometimes scare myself, I sometimes need to calm myself down.

Still trying to figure if I should tap in on my emotions and actually try to connect with a friend or a family member. I've always thought that to have a connection, you'd relate to one another, two distinguished lives having the same thoughts and feelings about the topics one would talk about, not completely identical, but enough to make you feel related as if you felt a connection right then and there.

And bunch of other things.. I feel that this is long enough.

And for the grand finale, life and death.
I've always perceived living as weird.
I still think about us being a side effect of whatever the hell this reality is supposed to be. And worse, if it had purpose. Why would that be? How would it work out? Who or what would be our purpose to fulfill?
And also, why was it me that got in the egg in the first place? Why wasn't it, and please excuse me, a single sperm, not me, that could've gotten there first?
It just doesn't make sense to me. What are the chances of us being conscious and shit wtf.
Getting a weird frame of mind, hope today was better than last night everyone."
1,"Therapy is such a racket. Therapy is such bullshit. I have a hard time believing it substantially helps anyone beyond just having a potentially caring person to talk to. I get so frustrated when people tell others to “get help” or “seek therapy” like it’s a panacea that will work wonders if only you try hard enough. Been there, done that. It won’t make me physically healthy again, won’t fix my fucked looks, and won’t make me more popular. A big fuck you to the disingenuous “get help” crowd."
1,"I'm apparently a big piece of trash.. Hello reddit, I've been in a relationship with my gf for almost 6 years now. We've been on and off, for the last 2 years I struggled with addiction (It wasnt that bad, just got hooked to coke and spent most of my money and time partying hard). I've been clean for almost 5 months now. Today we got in an argument and she completly destroyed me, she said I've always harrased her for sex cause I was to insistent when she said no. She said all my friends were terrible, she said I was lazy, I had no future, etc. To be honest, this kinda made me realize all of this is true. I've been lying to myself for years now thinking I was a good person, a good boyfriend, a good friend, a good son. It all feels like a lie now. I've struggled with depression before but today it's getting harder. I cant stop thinking about taking my life. Feeling like there's no point anymore, i'm trash and the world would be probably better without me."
1,Seuicide practice.. One day i will pull the trigger but today ill just put It to my head.
1,"How does one believe in oneself again?. I recently graduated college, and all I got for the last five months of my life is ""we have decided to pursue other candidates."" emails. I have felt nothing but defeat since I graduated, and with the recent plague it is even harder to find hiring organizations.  How do I believe in myself again?"
1,"Thoughts have been overwhelming lately. I’ve been having a hard time sleeping and functioning lately.  Every time I go to rest, my mind won’t stop thinking, whether it’s about a certain game, feeling, something I said that day that I regret, my mind will find any little thing to make me stay up... it even made me paranoid last night. Without proper sleep and some other thing going on with me physically, I’ve been in hard core depression and shut down mode. I know I made a promise to my friends to call everyday but this promise is getting harder and harder to keep. I can’t talk properly, I can’t think properly, it’s annoying my friend and it’s frustrating me. Sometimes I wish I couldn’t talk and that I could only speak through sign language. I’d love to learn but I’m too stupid to remember anything. I’m turning into a stupid failure. Nothing about my life is meaningful to anyone. I’m nuisance. I guess that’s all I’ll ever be..."
1,"Does anyone else cry over stupid stuff?. I literally called my doctors office to ask a question and the lady kept interrupting and wouldn't let me finish what I was saying. It's no big deal, I'm sure she just wanted to hurry up and get me off the phone because she was busy. But as soon as I hang up I start tearing up for no reason at all. Like, it shouldn't be a big deal, but I cried involuntarily anyways. Just wondering if anyone else cries over little things that shouldn't matter?"
1,"I got an email from HR today that was sent to me and many other coworkers simply saying “Your supervisor and I will be reaching out to you tomorrow or the next day to discuss the upcoming weeks”. They asked for times we’d be available and I assume we’ll just get a call individually.

I have been furloughed and am on an on call basis. I’ve worked one day in the past several weeks. We have customers who need our products for medical things so certain products are essential. I am responsible for preparing materials for the assemblers. That being said I was told last week they have enough material and that I might have to come in for just one product which is what I took care of the one day I’ve worked. I have no idea what this email is about and am worried they’ll be asking me to come back sooner than planned. (We’ve been furloughed till May.) I’m trying to just hope for the best. I have no clue what they want to talk about 

I gotta say I have absolutely no desire to go back. I worked yesterday and I don’t know how I put myself through that on a daily basis. 

I hate my job but am grateful for it, and am aware of how this whole thing affects others negatively. I don’t wish harm on anyone. I’ve made other posts about this so I wont explain my disclaimer anymore lol.

The point is I didn’t get anything done today and am worried that tomorrow I’ll be too anxious to get anything done and that I’ll have to go back to work sooner than expected and then I really won’t be able to get anything done. I’m gonna try to sleep but that’s been difficult for me lately. This anxiety won’t help. 

I feel pathetic for how much I don’t want to work and honestly mentally can’t handle a full time 9-5. I feel there are things so deeply engrained in me that keep me from being a functioning, valuable member of society."
1,"Quarantine made me happier to help me deal with everything until my parents decided to control my life down to the minute. I was starting to feel happy, like I was able to do what I needed to be done to figure things out and get over some people. I was able to call friends and have a happy conversation instead of depressing ones. I was playing Xbox with my friends and genuinely enjoyed myself. Then my parents decided that staying up till 4am enjoying myself wasn’t normal. After I was doing that for 3 weeks and they knew I was doing it the entire time. Now since they decided that i was no longer normal they decided to do a strict “school schedule” while at home so they will plan when I wake up, when I eat, when I do online work, what I do in my “personal granted free time”. MY BODY STILL ISNT USED TO NOT GOING TO BED AT 4AM SO I DONT GET TIRED TILL THEN SO I GET 3 HOURS OF SLEEP SND THEY WONT LET ME NAP. It’s been happening for a week now. They act like it’s bringing our family together but me and my sister just hide in our rooms and that makes them unsettled. They also have scheduled times to go for a walk and to do a hand picked chore when there practically aren’t any left. I don’t see why they are doing this and I haven’t done anything wrong. I just want to go to work and watch my shows in piece. This is all so frustrating"
1,"I'm 15 years old and I feel like such a failure.. Ever since last year I've felt myself going down a deep decline in my mental health. I did acid about 7 months ago with someone I'm no longer friends with because everyone around me was telling me that she was toxic for me. I eventually see a therapist because my friends recommended I do as I tended to lash out at them. The therapist tells me that I have PTSD. I've lost all of my friends because I think that they're all less mature than me and that I've outgrown all of them. The only reason I stick around is because I'll be alone and I'll blame myself. I see the world so differently, I know acid and my (current) weed usage that my mother is actually okay with. She allows me to smoke weed because she thinks it's helping with my anxiety. I try to convince myself it doesn't but deep down I know it is. I tried hydrocodone after fucking stealing from my grandpa's cabinet. I don't know if I'm a teenager acting out, or if something is seriously wrong with me. I'm failing school, literally. All F's and I have had all F's since 6th grade. Yet for some reason they never decided to hold me back. I wish they did, cause now I'm the really dumb freshman who's always missing school and smokes weed. I don't want to be known as that. My therapist tells me that I'm actually quite intelligent for my age. This quarantine has really been messing me up even more. I came in contact with weed again, I can't talk to my therapist anymore because of it, I'm eating more food, I lost my routine and stay up all hours of the night, and worst of all is that I haven't done a sliver of my home school work. I know I'm fucking up, everyone I ask this to tells me that I'll be okay and that I shouldn't worry. But I know they're lying, I wish I wasn't treated like such a fucking child. My dad has sending me voicemails saying that he's out of jail and talking to me like I'm still 10 years old. I don't know how to respond to him because I don't know him at all, all he used to do with me as a kid was do everything for me. But not actually letting me figure anything out on my own, same with my mom. Speaking of my mom, since I'm the only one living with her in a 2 bedroom apartment I realized that I've been through torture for so long. The name calling she does, I get called dumb, stupid, and a pig for no reason, she makes all of these mean noises when I even try to talk to her. My therapist tells me it's her way of coping with her own insecurities because she used to be overweight and some people do say she is a bit of an airhead. Lastly, I think I've realized that I have so much more stuff to go through. I thought I had the answer to everything, I thought I was psychic. I still sometimes think I am. And after looking at all of this your only question is probably ""how have you not killed yourself yet?"" and I don't know. I don't want to kill myself, I just wouldn't care if I died because I provide nothing either way. 

&#x200B;

(I might do edits on this because I just need to let everything out. I'm sorry if the grammar is bad or weird)

**TLDR:** My life has gone to shit and I have no idea how I can recover. Venting about various subjects including failing all my classes, my dad & mom, my ~~toxic~~ friends, my addiction to weed, and my therapist.

1,"Wish I could. Most nights I sit awake in my bed and just wish to be dead, that I just disappear and be gone. Wish I didn’t care about anyone else wish I could just do it, but I can’t/won’t. Why u might ask. Welp I’ll tell you. The pain I deal with on the daily is not enjoyable but it’s mine and ik I can atleast contain it and keep living but if I killed my self then the pain would be passed to everyone close to me and idk how they would cope. In the end me staying alive in this hell is better for everyone else if that makes sense"

1,"I feel so emotionless that even if something crucially good happens to me.... I just feel worse, because I can't react to it properly. I start analyzing my consciousness, and I freak out, thinking I am crazy - because of my anhedonia and damaged dopamine receptors. I feel so emotionless that I feel delusional, because I am not able to match my thoughts with any emotions. I feel so emotionless that sometimes I feel like I'm going speechless; not like I don't know what to say but like literally speechless, my mind gets out of control and I feel like going completely silent. I feel so emotionless, so unconnected to my body and to my soul. When I look at this empty life I feel like I'm in nightmare, but then I pretend I'm okay so good that I can even fool myself it's okay. Nothings connected. I'm so out of touch with my memories. It's just now and random thoughts I can think of, nothing is sorted in any way. Sometimes I get better days, when I wake up in a brave mood, ready to cop with it. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up, and the cycle starts again. I don't know what to expect. It feels like some part of me gave up on me and I can't continue without it. I don't know what's real. I don't know what's faith. I don't know nothing but fear. I feel like a ghost haunted by ghosts that tease me with all of this experience, not pushing to the point where I am really delusional or hear voices or whatever's the maximum level of fucked up mentality, but they tease me just enough to become more crazy and crazy with each day. I just can't feel anything but a creepy peace. I can't remember emotions. I can't imagine a happy place. Feels like I achieved everything. Or like I've achieved nothing, nothing that truly matters. I don't know if I'm getting better. I don't know if I'm getting worse. Recently it got to that point where I absolutely lost control of my mind and where it wanders. I'm so so empty and no medication can truly help it, I believe; no therapy either - I already told the most important people in my life and it didn't give me a relief. Being honest used to be a safe spot, but I played with lies and being honest my whole life so much that I lost the difference between good and evil. I could manipulate every situation to work in my favor. Now I can't be real. But should I blame myself? My shitty childhood and early teenage life created this coping mechanism, not me. It used to be a defense from the cruel world, now I'm consumed by it. Feels like I can no longer escape. I wish I could sleep happily again..."
1,"Any advice helps. Hi,

My name is Jarred and over the last year in my life I have had an ongoing issue of anxiety and depression. I began therapy for anxiety in October of this year which lead to a big drop in my overall anxiety, but I never really brought up depression, as I thought these feelings had direct correlation to my anxiety. However, as therapy went on I soon realized that my depression was an independent issue. But I decided not to bring it up as my mom, who put me into therapy (I was 17 at the time), and my therapist both believed my life was changing for the better and I was a much happier person. The whole goal of therapy was to get my anxiety ready for me to move out and go to college come August and in the eyes of my therapist and mother, I have reached that point.

Fast forward to today. I recently started dating a girl I met at work and our relationship has surpassed any expectations I had for it. I am very happy to say I love my girlfriend and she makes me very happy. However, my depression really drags me down at times and I have constant feelings that I am worthless and I will often feel insecure about myself. I have very few friends and at times I feel like I have nobody in my life. The only person I have to turn to when I am feeling this way is my girlfriend. While she makes me feel much better about myself and cares a ton about my mental health, I feel like I vent to her too much and if I countinue like this she will end up leaving me. So I resort to crying by myself and feeling like total shit. I do not know where these feelings come from or what to do, and I feel just as lonely as I did before I had my girlfriend sometimes. Please give me any advice you feel could help my situation. Thanks."
1,"What does your depression feel like?. Describe your experience of depression using a metaphor.

Here’s mine:

I convince myself I’ve made the world quite haphephobic. I take up far too much space to steady the nervous, staggered breathing of an earth which seems to desire nothing but twenty one years’ worth of distance from my heavy limbs; an earth in need of separation from my desperately broken mind and body."
1,"alone. i feel so incredibly alone.
as soon as it was announced that we were going to be quarantined my heart broke. i was finally getting better things seemed to be getting better. i hate my life at home and always will. and everything’s getting worse. and to top it, i feel so alone. i feel like i have no one. no one seems to be talking to em so during the day i sit and do nothing. i can feel myself falling back into old habits. and im literally not strong enough for it to happen again. i cant do it."
1,"Will I be able to keep going?. My life is constantly going to shit and I feel lonely, I’ve constantly made jokes about killing my self since 8th grade. At the beginning they were just jokes but soon it started becoming a reality.

I have a very shirt family that does not really support me, but even with all of those problems I still try to put my best effort in things. I have the highest average of all the kids in my grade, I’m the president of my class and I always try to be the best.

The thing is, no person at home really values my effort  and it is really frustrating. I’ll come home with straight A’s but my dad and mom won’t even care. My dad is barely at home and when he is he just scolds me and beats me, calling me useless, idiot and a variety of other insults. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself for the longest time, but teachers, friends and people from other schools tell my I have a bright future ahead of me, that I could be the best engineer, architect, game designer, etc.

These complements are the only things keeping me alive, I just dream of the day I’ll be able to get out of my house and live on my own, possibly with someone that actually cares for me. But until then, every time I come home it’s hell, and now with covid-19 it’s even worse..."
1,"Is it worth it.. Is life really worth living. Yes we all have dreams. But majority of it will never happen. Whether it’s money we will never have. Or a love we will never experience. I can only imagine a reason to live. We all experience different hardships. Some more toxic and terrifying than others. How we handle it is different, but is the pain and torment worth it. Super depressed and mentally unstable. Just a little suicidal"
1,"Woohoo, relapse. My mom knows the perfect ways to tear me right the fuck down. The only reason my arms dont look like barcodes rn is because I had to sit down stairs for an hour, so I just checked out. I dont remember any of that hour and now that I'm alone everything's flooding back and it's taking everything in me not to break a shaving razor rn. 

My best friend is texting me but I cant tell him I want to relapse. Hes so happy that I'm 4 months clean and I cant put pressure on him like that, he has a lot going on.

I feel like I'm just another teenager overreacting. I dont have a diagnosis, I have food and shelter and both parents, I'm ungrateful. I dont know."
1,"Anyone else “block out” certain parts or don’t remember details of when you were at your worst point/traumatic experiences?. My depression fluctuates a lot, like all of us. However, I came across some old postings of mine on a different site and I literally blocked out details of traumatic things that happened to me-maybe rewrote them in my mind to blame myself as well. 

There are also times my friends will ask if I remember how much I liked certain movies we saw together (or activities, etc) and I will tell them I haven’t seen them. They get frustrated because I have seen them WITH them yet I just can’t remember. 

At that point in time over a couple of years my depression was incredibly horrible. I was so close to ending it all, it scares me to think about. 

I don’t know if it was the looming depression, maybe the weed I was excessively smoking, or the heavy drinking. I’m just shocked by the things I don’t remember-little things and huge life changing details of bad experiences. I also find it odd because I study psychology and there isn’t really such a thing as “blocking” it out I guess.

Anyone else relate?  

TLDR: At the worst part of my depression and suicidal ideation, when I look back I can’t remember details of my life at that point. It’s unnerving. Is this normal? Anyone relate?"
1,"i’m losing myself again. i don’t want to be here anymore.. ive struggled with depression for the past 15 years and i’m not even 30 years old. i have tried to kill my self twice. it’s all up and downs. there’s months, or even years, where i am “normal”. and then there’s times where i just spiral and lose myself. i’ve sat on my couch and cried for an hour for no reason today. i am tired of feeling this way, i am tired of being okay for a while and then coming back to these feelings. why should i keep going if this is how my life will be? why should even be alive if i can never escape depression? if i can be normal and function for a while and then get back to this? it makes no sense. i don’t really want my life to be like this.
i feel like i am losing myself again. i don’t want to be “living”. i don’t know what to do. i am tired of all of this."
1,"Messing up is the only way I learn.. This world is far less tolerant because people are a much more common resource, making mistakes makes you easily expendable, which makes you vulnerable, which brings on anxiety. I'm not perfect, I will always be ME, and this world is not very accommodating to those that don't have a choice about their disposition, REGARDLESS of how hard they work."
1,"What do you do when the place that drains your motivation the most is the place you’re trapped in?. That place is my room. The living room scares me because there were rats there not too long ago and I’m not convinced they’re all dead so every time I sit there I just get really anxious about the possibility that they’re around here somewhere. My parents’ bedroom is a mess. There is no backyard. There is no space. I only have my room.

My room is the place I stayed the most out of during my recovery. I only really came in there to sleep because being there makes me want to give up and just lay on the bed with my phone or sleep. 

Now I eat, get entertainment, do/did homework, and flipping go to school on my bed. 

And now I’m behind on a ton of my assignments because I can’t seem to get any motivation. I could feel my motivation slipping away and I tried to fight it but all of my solutions were really only short term.

Now I feel stuck literally and metaphorically"
1,"Quarantining with my parents has made me realise just how much my BF does for my mental health. Before the UK 'lockdown', I was living at my BFs with his mum during the week and going home at the weekends, slowly moving to being at his fully. I stayed at my parents over a long weekend so my mum could use my car for work while hers was being repaired when the news came in that we couldn't go anywhere and all that jazz. I decided to stay at my parents so she could continue to use my car if she needed. Cut to today, nearly a month later, and I am a mental mess. I've seen my BF once, when he picked some stuff up for us from the supermarket (my mum started showing minor symptoms) but other than that, I haven't seen him in a month. I miss having him close, talking on the phone isn't enough. I need to be held only the way he does. Being at my parents is overwhelming me, and I took for granted just how much better I was mentally when I was at my BFs"
1,"So I guess making new friends is off the table now with the Covid19 situation. I don't really mean new friends, I have no friends. This situation has me feeling hopeless since there's no known end in sight. I could see myself slipping into suicidal ideation again if They can't make any friends, can't be with people. 

I might have to start gaming again, maybe try an online game or something.

1,Covid 19. Theres a part of me that justs whishes id catch the coronavirus just so it will all end i am tired and i am ready to die. I feel as though i havw nothing left and that i have never mattered to anyone untill i had nothing left. For so many years i shruged off the abuse of always being told i am not good enough that i dont mesure up that i am a loser. Well you guys won i believe it now. And now you tell me i matter and all the little things i do are achievements but its to late i welcome death it be a belessing for it to end yet i cant bring myself to commit scuicide for some reason but if the covid could take me out id be okay with that ...
1,"I can't pick up my phone. Ever since the quarantine, I've been living in my bedroom mostly doing nothing. My family, friends and unknown numbers keep on calling me. I didn't open my message at all for 2 weeks. Now my siblings are pissed off at me and they even said my friends are looking for me and asked me to open my message. I'm scared to open my message and there's this unknown number that keep on calling me everyday. I want to answer it but I get nervous breakdown when I see the number. Idk why and it's killing me cause I feel like this call is important but I just can't do it. I want to disappear"
1,"I want to end my life. So depressed I want to set myself on fire as a protest or demonstration.

Or lay down in a remote wooded region until I die from dehydration.


I am so depressed I can't live anymore.


Please someone put me out of my misery.

Will you help me?"
1,"feeling suicidal because of penis. i'm sure you've all seen this post before, and i've read every one like it on this sub out of desperation.. but i really cant do it anymore and i have to say something

my inadequate penis has brought me so much shame and feelings of worthlessness throughout my life and it's only gotten worse. these past few months it has gotten completely unbearable. i avoid urinating and showering because i dont want to see it.. it doesnt leave my mind for a moment and i find myself being thrown into these uncontrollable crying fits at night.. it doesnt help that i'm a 26 almost 27 year old neet never been able to hold down a job for more than a few months due to who the fuck knows what. plagued with horrible depression and anxiety, ADHD.

 have 0 friends, never been in a relationship and i'm finding myself losing it with the realization that i'll never experience being wanted, or desired, or satisfying a woman.. to see the look of excitement in her eyes when she sees your big penis must be so great. 

the only advice people seem to give is to basically distract her from your penis with good oral.. and hopefully try and forget about the 8"" silicone penis underneath her bed that she turns to when she wants to feel good. this life is so fucked and it's only getting worse. if i had any courage at all i would end it."
1,I don’t want to leave my room.. School is shit and it’s cold outside. Why would I want to leave my room?
1,Quarantine is bad. I am a high school senior and I have had depression in my life since I was in the 2nd and the reason today just took a turn for the worse and I got in an argument with them because they are trying the best to force religion on me and because I have a big family who are all super religious I feel like a outcast all the time. Even now I can hear my family outside laughing and having fun while I’m here crying. Because of quarantine i am home all the time and I feel like an outcast in my house and the only people who I feel close to are my friends and even though I try my best to talk with them it’s not going good because of this quarantine. And I’m pretty sure that the closest person in my family now dislikes me. My family try’s to show me as the bad kid to my younger siblings by saying things like don’t end up like me and that I’m a bad influence ( which I can sorta understand because I’ve also went and thought it was a good idea and tell my parents about how I smoke weed to help cope and now I’m the pot head in the family) I’m sorry that this is long but I just wanted someone to hear me out so thank you.
1,".. i even started liking the way all my removed yet posts were ignored. like i know there are so many and the time i post something is... depends on were are you from, for me it's now 4:30 morning; but it only makes me feel more and more sure (like i didn't reach it yet) about my wothlessness.
the way i wanna hide everything deep inside and scream it at someones face at the same time...
why am i still alive? why can't i just go sleep and don't wake up?"
1,"Jaded with medical care and the concept of improvement. I have a long history with the Mental Health industry. Multiple therapists, multiple trips to the stability ward, multiple different medications. I've heard everything, seemingly, that those things can say, because they keep repeating themselves:

>""every experience strengthens you""
>
>""it gets better eventually""
>
>""this medicine will help""
>
>""You're valuable""

To say I've had a ""bad"" experience with the Mental Health industry is disingenuous. All my former counselors are good people. but interacting with them doesn't go anywhere. My past has *not* strengthened me. It has *not* gotten better. The medicine did *not* help. I'm *not* valuable. And please, don't bother disagreeing with that last one in the comments. That'll save us both some energy and time. That's not the point of the post, I've spent far too much energy and time discussing that with the  Mental Health industry. Thanks.

I've long held the position that if I ever end up in the hospital again, I'd never leave. because there's no growth, no plan for my future or any future. no hope for me. This is where I am, and I can't get better or worse, I can only *appear* differently, and only in the short term. Even that I think is lost for me because I can't pretend anymore. I can't pretend that this isn't how things are, and can't pretend that this isn't how things will be.

So why am I here? because in all that I have experienced, no one has agreed with me, ever. no one has actually considered or entertained my position. no one has said *""you're right, 14ierophant: that life sucks, that you're going to die, and that everything would be better if it happened soon. ****In the meantime, here's what you can do****.""*

And that's what I'm looking for. I don't need a cure, I don't need to change who I am, I don't need to be happy. We're so far beyond happy at this point, trust me. I just need a reason to do something, anything, in a world where nothing has value. Where do I turn to find that? What box do I check and on which form? Who do I hire or ask?"
1,"I can’t communicate.. I’m only ever truly calm and at rest when I’m alone. I’ve realised that I’m not fully comfortable with anyone. Not my friends, not my boyfriend, not even my family. I always feel the need to deliver. I have to provide something otherwise they’ll get tired of me. It’s just easier by myself. When there’s no pressure to be interesting or engaging.

I remember growing up, I’d constantly change myself to suit who I was with. I’d change my personality for the sake of getting along with someone. Now, I feel like I don’t really have a personality. I bore myself with things I say and I find myself annoying. I’m not funny at all and I’m not intelligent or knowledgable and I have nothing witty or wise to say.

For these reasons I don’t really talk. I struggle with one-on-one conversations with another person. So, I can forget about group conversations or mealtime chit chat. I just don’t have anything to add. I can’t even bring myself to answer the door or pick up the phone.

Recently I’ve noticed that I’m distancing myself a lot. I don’t reach out to my friends. The conversations I have with my boyfriend these days are very repetitive and I’m worried that he’ll get bored of me and realise that I’m not as interesting as he thought. Because when he sees past his rose coloured glasses and notices that I’m not as exciting as he thought, he’ll leave. He’s the most meaningful person in my life.

I’ve never been super close to my parents. My mum even confronted me recently about how “I don’t even want to be her friend”. I feel terrible and she seemed hurt but honestly, I don’t think I can ever fully open up to someone. Not even my mum. I don’t think she’d wouldn’t like me. We are very different.

Im scared that when I transition to a new school in September, I’ll be too guarded to even try and interact with people. Then I’ll get left behind and have to spend the next two years without anyone.

I don’t know. I reading this and I feel like I’m probably making a mountain of a molehill. Oh well, at least I got it out."
1,"Am I really depressed, or am I just pretending I am? [16M]. Note: Coming back after writing this, I realize I kinda get all over the place for me. I'd appreciate if you stick with me and keep reading through. Thanks.

Hey, I don't really know how to start this, but I feel like I might be depressed, but I don't know if it's just a ""Boo-hoo, I have a small problem in my life and I'm now depressed,"" which I really hate and do not want to be (I remember doing something like this where I was making jokes about depression and saying I had it - this felt this was definitely faked looking back, and I feel like a complete asshole for doing that, especially to a person who actually has depression (it almost felt like I was making fun of depression) - this is something I will hate myself forever for doing and wish I could take back so bad - I really do not want to relapse onto this behavior - I might have been doing this for the attention, but I really was not sure why I did this at the time). Basically, I \*really\* don't want to be a dick, and part of me keeps telling myself I am really just faking all of this.

I've been questioning myself about this often now, I tried denying it to myself, but I don't know.

Recently I feel like I just stopped caring for some things, especially school-work. I know I used to get anxious if I didn't turn stuff in the day it was due, or that I need to study for a particular assessment, but recently, I had that feeling disappear. I keep pushing deadlines, and I have tonnes of stuff to make up, but I haven't felt the same tension to work that I used to (this is something my mom pointed out) - making me feel lazier. I often now go into class without finishing assignments, pushing them back forever. And also, I feel a severe lack of motivation to do this work - I'm always procrastinating by watching YouTube or whatever. This made my grade drop by a lot - I usually get pretty good grades (A-B), but my last semester has been complete shit (A-C - and low C because I have not turned things in). This is making me worry I could lose my honors classes, which I really do not want to lose and is something I am stressed out about. These grades are not me, and my parents are saying I should drop these classes (which I really don't want to). I feel like it's easy and I can do it, but my grade does not paint the same picture. I want to be able to do my work, and get my grade up, but I just can't motivate myself anymore - or something is going on but I'm not sure. Yet, I am also scared as hell about losing my classes. I just don't get it.

This lack of working has given extreme frustration from my parents. It feels like everyday I'm getting yelled at for not doing my work, or at least doing enough. And when I do some of it, I have so much to catch up on, so ultimately it feels like I barely did anything, and I feel like my parents think the same, even though I sometimes spend hours catching up (also counting for when I distract myself on whatever), I get nothing - no break - no time to relax - and have to use means that I am not allowed to do to get something (like procrastinating even more or staying up late). My mom brought up concerns about a possible attention disorder, but I pushed it aside. After all, I don't want to be the kid with an attention disorder, now do I? It feels like an endless cycle I can't break.

My grades and all that jazz has lead me to lose a lot of my electronics as well. The thing is, I always feel like I really want to do something, like maybe play a game, make a video, anything inspiring, and I just can't because I'm fucking grounded. I want to go and play something on my console, because I feel like I can be happy doing that (and is something I really enjoyed), but I can't because I had that taken for saying some nasty stuff (I will touch up on this later). I also had (right now) my phone taken for, literally no reason. I know this sounds really cliche and stupid, but I feel like the things that make me happy or bring me joy are all gone. Maybe I'm being a whiny teenager who just is not thankful enough...

I also found myself getting a lot more aggressive and angry. My dad has always been a bit shouty and aggressive. He can never command me to do something while also being nice - he always rudely tells me to do whatever. I have lately been whispering stuff back (i.e: Fuck you, What an asshole, etc.) I have not always been this aggressive, but I feel myself going there. And going purely based on emotion, I fucking hate him - he can't ever leave me alone and give me privacy, and he is such an asshole by taking shit whenever he feels like it with no justification needed. He is always asking about my homework, and making it seem like I put less effort than what I really did. He keeps bringing up my work, always telling me off about it, and it's not doing me any good, and I am getting to a point where I can't fucking stand it. (Sorry, I needed that rant - I don't know if I really meant any of it - maybe I am just a normal teen going through teen stuff). I also see myself seething at trivial things, for example, right now when people are coming in my room while writing this, or when my room door was forced wide open by my parents to check in my work while writing this (probably because I want to keep this secret from them - I'll dive into this later). I don't know why I'm doing this, and it's all probably going worse with the quarantine.

I've seen myself going to the bathroom to just sit there in silence and sadness and just feeling horrible in general (usually after my dad has decided to yell at me or whatever), and bleary eyed, have to forcibly tell myself over and over again, ""I'm okay."" before I can come back out. This has been happening quite a lot.

Recently, I had an event of me just crying for no explainable reason. I went into my room and started crying. I tried to deny this. When my dad came in and asked what was wrong, he came in angry and shouting about it, and when I couldn't tell him, he got more and more furious (it almost felt like he was forced to come in - not doing this because he genuinely wanted to). My dad left out of anger and frustration, to where my mom came in and, well, just handled it a lot better. This happened once. Later in the day, my mom asked if I was depressed, to where I didn't know what to answer with, so I just said no (while kinda laughing it off).

I also caught myself eating more. Like, going into the kitchen to grab a snack for no reason. I'm not even hungry - and (context - am already a bit chubby) feel really unhealthy and bad about it. I don't know why I do this.

All these issues have all been highlighted and intensified by the quarantine we are having - especially not being able to go out (as it feels like going to school really helped me with this stuff - it was a place to get away from my parents).

\*These next two things are something I am going to find really difficult talking about (I really tried to avoid talking about these things), and frankly, I am not comfortable having online, but screw it, here it goes.\*

I have recently been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have been visualizing myself dead. Of course, I don't really want to die, but I have been thinking about it a lot - probably too much. I've also done self harm before and recently (cutting my leg), but that was either for me lashing out onto myself, or attention, or maybe both. I don't know. When my parents found out, I wanted comfort, but instead I got a yelling. I also had an incident where I was close to suicide (the issue was frankly, really dumb and it was probably more for attention than anything else), but I knew I didn't really want to die.

I also have an avid masturbation/porn addiction. It's really not doing my any well. My parents found out about this, and they (currently) are not that suspicious of it, but truly, I still have been doing it. I really hate this part of me, and want to change, but I keep relapsing. I know it's wrong (that's what religion says (plus that lives will be terrible with people who follow this path - which I am worried now that is applied to me)). I hope this isn't what brings me to hell (which speaking of, I also lately haven't been praying all that much, so that may also be a cause).

This has all taken me forever to write, and now that I just finished pouring my heart out, I should probably say I haven't told anyone all of this. Anyone. I'm scared of having depression (I don't want to have it - it would suck to be known as the one depressed kid), I don't want to go through therapy, and I don't fancy telling very many people this. I want to be normal.

I think I got everything, but I may come back to this if I feel like I missed talking about something. If you actually bothered reading through this mess, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just felt like I needed to let this all out - everything that has been bothering me - and I really appreciate you reading this. <3

Edit: added random crying + mom asking + some extra bits in the section i don't want to talk about"
1,"How do I get my Mother to understand what I'm going through? Help. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I've talked to many counselors for my school to camp, and once a therapist that came by my school because my school struggles with mental health issues my counselor couldn't keep up with. Regardless they've all suggested that I get help, be it medication or having a real Therapist, but my mother refuses to get me anything for my depression and anxiety (I'm sixteen I cant go over her head). Anytime I bring up that I'm struggling with life she says ""be a man about it"" or ""Real men dont cry"". I dont have a father to help with these problems. I dont know how to to tell her without making a scene of myself. I'm tired of the pain, I want help so bad but I can't reach out because anytime I do I feel like I'm going to get ridiculed for it. What do I do? How do I make her understand?"
1,"For the first time in over a year, I swept my kitchen floor. ^((hello again, I was so humbled and appreciative of all the feedback on my first post here last time. I don't talk on Reddit. I have under 2k karma and 5y+ account. I've been lurking my entire life because of anxiety of posting anything or entering a conversation or just too depressed to even think of contributing. for the first time, on my first entry, i felt so happy.))

&#x200B;

I just lived with it. I fully expected be walking barefoot on dog treat crumbs and papers and dust and clutter. 

Over the past year my kitchen has been filling with cardboard and garbage. I estimate I've taken out 10-12 trash bags over the past month or so. I've had a string of good days and feel like I can do normal person things! 

This time last year I was in rehab for alcohol. I lost 4 years of my life drinking to isolate and medicate my depression. Couple that with having a undefined sleep disorder hypersomnia type which makes me able to sleep for ten, twelve, sixteen hours no problem! I can sleep anywhere. On the floor. Concrete. You know how I Found out? I fell into micro-sleep last year driving 55mph at 4:30 am to work (thankfully no one else on the road) and drove off the road smashing a road sign on my side. I woke up and corrected and all that happened was that my mirror got yeeted into the forest. I can't afford a new one. It looks like shit."
1,"Why do I still feel like this?. I've been on so many different medications, I've been to therapy. I moved to a different state for a fresh start, I met new friends. All of this should have helped me, but it really never did. No matter what I do, I just feel empty. I dont know if I'm ever going to feel better. What else is there even left to try? I feel like my depression used to be better because there was at least the hope that things could change. But now I know it never will."
1,"Just need to say this to someone. I am in my mid 20s, working and going to Uni(atm online courses bc of corona)  
I feel ashamed for writing this, but my mind is full of dark thoughts at the moment and I just want to get it off of my chest before i suffocate.

I am stuck at work at the moment I might need to put up an all-nighter since last week I could not get out of bed and I have fallen behind with Uni and work stuff. To be honest I am falling apart but I am a pretty good actor, so no one has noticed. My depression comes and goes, and this time its horrible. My whole body feels heavy, especially my chest, I can feel my heart pounding the whole time. 

My thoughts are racing and the only thing that I want is to go to bed, hide my head under the cushion, and cease to exist. The worst part is this feeling in my head and eyes.   
Do you know that feeling that you get when you are emotional, seconds before you start crying?  
Like when you are cutting onions and you try to hold your tears back. For some days I have been constantly feeling like that. It is truly horrible. I want to scream, hit the wall with my head until it stops and then some more.  
Aside from that I am a fucking Idiot, due to some stupid decisions I now only have around 15 euros in my bank account. I truly loath myself. If I could somehow get out of this body and be in the same room with myself, I would beat me up until I showed some of the drive that I used to have in my teens.  


My thoughts are not even that consistent at the moment. I can feel insanely sad and angry and then suddenly feel as dry as sand emotionally.  


I wish I had someone to share this to be honest, I wish I could would feel loved.   


As the sun is setting down and I am here alone, I have this faint voice that tells me to jump outside the window. But shit, have you ever tried jumping outside a window? Your whole body freezes and you can not move any muscles. Your hands get all tingly and sweaty, your skin cold. You breath slowly but heavily. Memories start to pop up in your head, of people who love you, mom, dad, friends.  


I will never give up on life though.  
I do not know if there is anything after death but I doubt it, I believe it to be like going under anesthesia, devoid of consciousness one returns to nothing. And that is a truly sad but also reassuring thought."
1,"I'm fucked up about myself a little bit more everyday. Hey, at the moment I'm on a crossroad of my life.
My dog died last month, my girlfriend and I broke up a week ago and my studies is going down the drain.

I'm in my examination phase and I can't do anything except for lying in bed, watching YouTube, smoke cigarettes, eat, drink, going to toilet and get fucked up about myself.

I didn't sleep before 2 am in the past 2 weeks (although I tried medicine) and I can not get concentrated when I'm trying to learn for my examinations. If I fail them then the pressure will be even higher. And if I fail the studies then I will be 25 with no vocational training or a job. And I don't even have like a jobidea for me...

I'm fucked up and I hate myself for not being stronger, for being ""lazy"" and that shit.
It's a constant circle of fucking me up more and more.

Maybe you have handled situations like this in the past and have advices for me. This would be lovely.

Thanks. ❤️"
1,"I feel like taking a shower. Just because. I took one yesterday and now I am debating on taking one tonight. 

I just want to feel and smell good with my favorite stuff. 

Feels good."
1,"Trying to heal after a breakdown. I’m in the middle of a horrible depressive episode. I cried hysterically and screamed pretty much nonstop for three days and barely slept. Last night things got really, really bad. I finally convinced my husband, son, and ex-husband that I can’t do anymore. I have to stop and take care of myself, or I won’t be around much longer. I can’t do everything for everyone (I have some extremely needy men in my life!). 

So I was told to rest and they would take care of everything. Except they’re not. They’re letting my body rest when it’s my MIND that needs a break. They keep coming to me asking for help with computers, video games, what to have for meals, how to make the meals, whether or not they should buy eggs at the store or throw away a flyer for homeowners insurance (we rent an apartment). 

How can I communicate to them that I’m not capable of all this right now? You’d think that the fact that I start crying hysterically, pulling at my hair, and screaming “I can’t do this!!!!” when they ask me for help would be a good clue. But they still don’t get it. 

I’m in serious, serious trouble. I haven’t had a depressive episode this bad in years. To top it all off, my husband lost his job and we don’t have health insurance. I’m trying to take care of myself the only way I know how, but they’re making it impossible. 

What can I do?"
1,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm never good enough for anyone. People get bored with fast and leave. My mother tells me I fat and I should stop eating so much. I'm just so tired of work and school. Stress has made me sick and weak. I just need someone to stay, and not just talk to me and then up and leave forever."
1,"is feeling neutral towards everything related towards depression?. like, i wouldn't call it numbness, it's just that i have no strong feelings, towards most things. e.g. when my therapist asked me how i found the session, i didn't know what to say because i have no feelings about it - it was just something that happened. and a lot of the time when she asks me things like ""do you want to improve on x?"" i just answer that i don't know (because there's not really anything i want). i also feel this way in most of my friendships; they're my friends and i ""love"" them, but i don't really get attached to or trust anyone. recently i've opened up a little to 2 of my friends, but it wasn't really about trusting them more, it's just i don't care if they tell people, because i'm not scared of losing friends. and i do want close relationships, it just seems like i'm unable to connect to anything. everything and everyone just exists, and that's all.

edit: just realised i wrote the title wrong, it's meant to be *related to, not towards. oops."
1,"I don’t care about anything. I’m starting to feel as if nothing matters anymore. I could go outside and go on walks with my dog or I could stay indoors but either way I am not doing anything worthwhile with my time. There is no purpose of me being around at all. I’m starting to run out of things to stay to others because my own words and ideas feel unimportant that I can not bare to talk. I don’t want to die because I’m in pain, but just because I am so unbearably bored of life."
1,Anyone else here cope with drug use?. I don't hear it mentioned much in this sub but chasing a euphoria is the only thing that brings me joy these days. I'm like a junkie trash can. My drug of choice is anything that I can get in my needle. I've tried to get sober lots of times but life is painfully boring.
1,"Something I thought of to help me through quarantine. I really miss a certain someone. I felt like just as things really went into lockdown I made a breakthrough with them. Being easily bummed, I’m trying to say “I can’t wait to see them” as opposed to “Oh god I miss them” or similar.

Idk, sometimes it’s the little things I have to look for through all of this."
1,"I am tired of this. So I am a a PC Gamer and I bought an XFX Radeon  RX 570 4 GB for my PC and it's been having a lot of problems ever since, From fan rattling noise to major performance problems, And worst of all is that I can't get an RMA as it's used...

I have been worrying too much about these problems and I am tired of it, And I am also kinda scared of gaming now as I don't want to find more problems...

I also like doing Judo but since there's home quarantine I can't go anywhere...

So what do you advice me to do? I am tired of this, Any advice would be appreciated."
1,"I don't see an end to this. I cannot remember a time when I wasn't depressed. Not even childhood. When I was a kid, I used to scratch my face until it bled because I thought that my freckles were ugly and the reason I had so few friends, and maybe if I scratched hard enough they would disappear. By first grade, I was in and out of therapist and psychiatrist offices. When they asked me what was wrong, I would usually say something to the effect of ""I'm the worst person ever and I don't deserve happiness"". I was once even suspended from elementary school cuz I got in trouble with the teacher for throwing a pencil at a student during a test (on a side note, the teacher yelled at me cuz I ""could've poked his eye out"", which is real fucking stupid since there were folders up so I literally just hit his folder and not him; I think the teacher just hated me), and on the walk down to the principal's office, I banged my chest until my the teacher constrained my arms because I wanted my heart to stop. The principal would not allow me back in school until I received a psychiatric evaluation. I think back on those childhood memories, and then I look at my life now, and I think that maybe there is just no end to this feeling. 

  
I've been thinking a lot recently about how maybe I'm just like this. Like, I'm just depressed and that's the way it's always going to be. No meds, psychiatrists, hospital visits, or people are going to change that. I don't wanna waste ten, twenty, thirty, or however many years tricking myself into believing that this despair will just end."
1,"How to get access to antidepressants without going broke?. My health insurance has a massive deductible so basically unless I am hospitalized, I pay for everything. I have done therapy in the past and although I learned a lot, I can’t afford to do regular therapy sessions. My job hours have been cut because of Coronavirus and having to stay in lockdown has taken a severe toll in my mental health. For the first time I feel I need to do something to change because I am getting hopeless. I am interested in trying SSRI’s and have done some research, but I don’t know what options are available to get a prescription in an affordable manner. Are there any online or call in options that have affordable appointments with the OPTION to write a prescription? I know there are some therapy options, but I would like to consider an Rs and don’t think psychotherapy alone is a reasonable option. Obviously I live in America, which is why cost is such an important consideration. Thanks!"
1,"In a failing relationship with severe depression. I’ve (20F) always struggled with mental health but in the last year and a half, my depression got severe to the point of suicide being on my mind at all points of every day. I’ve been living with my boyfriend of over a year for a few months and found out recently that he had been buying nudes from some random girl on Snapchat (not even a hot celebrity, just some girl that lives in our state). I already had no hope, no love for myself, no trust for him, etc. and really don’t know how to cope. I’m not going to leave him because I feel like I don’t deserve any better and wouldn’t have a better relationship with someone else anyways. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Especially with being cooped up all day everyday during quarantine with him."
1,"My psychiatrist strongly recommended the hospital.. I don't want to go. I'm scared of the costs. I don't want my mom and sister to find out. They are my last line of stability. My last sense of normalcy. As soon as they found out, the relationship will change forever. My dad will want to be around more which is the complete opposite of what I want. My brothers will pity me. I dont want pity."
1,"sometimes I just need to scream. (19m) I've been feeling increasingly terrible. more and more each day. I won't lie I feel alone. I rejoined reddit because I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I've been struggling financially for a while. mostly because I'm trying to become a musician. my first friend group in college kicked me out because I was ""mentally unstable"" the people who didn't agree with that decision were forced to stop hanging out with me. I fucking hate my life. I almost didn't get through this year, but I started to play music from my windowsill. that was my only form of expression to feel better, but now, since corona, I don't have that medium. My whole family is pressure to me. they either expect me to succeed or want me to change my life plans. everyone from my old high school hates me or expects me to succeed. that kind of pressure makes me self conscious and then I breakdown. my first friend group in high school had a girl that I really enjoyed talking to. she was a really cool gal. she killed herself my freshman year. I don't know if that still causes me to feel so terrible. It was so long ago. one of the people from the college friend group introduced me to car seat headrest. I've been listening to them a lot recently. I know it's cringe, but sometimes I turn the volume up just so I can cry/scream. I hope I can impact someone like that someday. I will continue to overwork myself and ignore my problems, while college destroys me. I just thought that trying to put words to my feelings was a good idea."
1,"I haven't slept in days. It's been a couple month since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.

Sorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.

Also I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.

My mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.

Edit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid."
1,"I was just told that i´m not going to college this year..  

So, how you just read in the tittle yeah.

I´m 18 and i was about to get a job to have money, but when the corona and quarentine started i stopped.

My parents are the ones who choose my college and the ones who are paying for it. (They´re divorced btw)

My big sister college is about: 934 USD

Meanwhile mine is actually 79 USD.

I was just told that they don´t have enough money to pay for it and that they don´t see me ""Ready"" for the life. My mom told me that i never go out and that i don´t work and that i´m always in my PC.

Like. We all have to be in our homes... so... i can´t do anything about it. I´m stressed and i don´t know what to do."
1,"My point of view. Everything in my brain is telling me to find a mate. That's pure facts. 

Were all just animals...were peacocks going around and showing our feathers trying to impress a female peacock. So she'll want us. 

And from the females perspective I totally get it, you only spend time and chase after and desire men who have desirable products about them. 

I just wish I had some shiny feathers.

It's the same old game,  day in and day out. 

I'm sick of being the loser. 

I'm sick of knowing I'm the loser."
1,"Serious question. Why would anyone lonely(not alone, lonely) who hates himself want to live?"
1,"We are all set up for a tragic life. Until a couple of months i was sure that i would become a music artist which has always been my dream. I know that i have talent. And i definenty don’t say that to brag but i know i do. I have played the piano all my life and I’m pretty good at producing music too. I now know that i’ll never be what i always wanted to be. And thats because i will never try. I’ve suffered from a crippling fear of rejection all my live and I’m painfully introverted when it comes to expressing myself. My dad is also very skillful when it comes to music and has an amazing voice, yet he has never done anything with this. I have now realized that this is because he is the same as me.
With that realization i also realized that i’ll never be anything either. I’ll be just like him, just a regular person who will live a regular life and then die and be forgotten. I’ve never told anyone about this because as i said I’m so damn scared of being laughed at or not taken seriously. It feels like everyones fate is already decided through their genes and we can’t do anything about it.

Does anyone else have similar issues or know something that helps?"
1,"Why can't people understand that they should leave me. I don't get it. I just don't get it. What possible fucking reason would anyone have for actually caring about me? What on God's green Earth could I possibly give back in a relationship? I'm annoying, I'm clingy, I'm attention seeking, I yell and scream at the drop of a hat, What possible benefit could they see in me? Sure, ***maybe*** I have some strengths (not even sure about that tbh), but they don't outweigh my flaws, and they aren't exactly useful in a relationship (I don't think anyone wants to be my friend because I can write a decent paper). So what the fuck is it, then? What could they possibly see in me that makes dealing with all my bullshit worth it? 

It's like I have a bomb strapped to my chest that's about to go off; I keep on telling people to get away or they'll get hurt, but they just refuse to acknowledge the bomb's existence. 

I'm just so tired of explaining this to people."
1,"waiting for this to all be over. My life has been such a pathetic failure that I don't even know what tf to do anymore. I'm such a fucking ugly cunt that I don't even want to look at myself in the mirror. No matter what tf I do it just doesn't help at all. I haven't had any friends since I left school and I don't even talk to my old ones anymore because I don't think they would ever care about my shitty problems. I wish this quarantine never ends because I don't want to ever have to show my ugly face to others.

I have like 1 billion different bloody things going on in my mind that it just drives me crazy every single day. My parents don't give a shit about me and I have no one to go to. I just wished I was never born.

Sorry if u read this I just had to get this out of my mind."
1,"What am I missing. I just got a reddit today so I could maybe talk to people that relate to me. So I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I’m 26 years old and started smoking weed back in high school. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome triggered by weed. It’s just not worth getting sick over anymore. Not trying to be dramatic but weed sort of filled that void in my life, or at least distracted me long enough but also I think it kind of made me worse in the long run. I don’t drink. Does anyone have any healthy coping mechanisms to suggest for depression and anxiety? This has been an ongoing battle for me."
1,"Potential suicide note/art. It's one of those days I feel like my existence is just a burden to other people. As a distraction, I did this thing.. it's ugly and not the usual art I do, but it has so much of my emotions that I poured into it. It contains all the thoughts and phrases I always think abt or say when I feel like I'm at a low point. But it didn't seem to help me :( while I was doing it, I just felt like harming myself all the more right after I finish my art. So I realized this could be a potential suicide note.. I'm really trying to stay strong at the moment though. 

So yeah I just wanna share what I did.. I hope it somehow helps those who feel the same way as I do that theyre not alone. Here's the link of what I did! please dont judge too hard hahaha

1,"Might be getting worse. This is gonna be my thrid post on here and honestly it kinda helps just to able to get it out. I don’t feel any emotions all too often and lately is been bleeding into my work and I started getting asked if I was okay, and I lied and said I was fine, for context this is the kind of lady who is very high energy in the work place and when she talks she wants someone to respond, which with how I’ve been I’m starting to zone out with headphones in playing music and I’m now constantly asking people to repeat them selves because I just don’t pay attention to anything. But back to my point is today I found my self at times being really fake to avoid being asked if I was okay again.... yea so that’s it, I’m gonna assume that I’m not getting better but I’m just taking everything day by day"
1,"What do you do when nothing interests you anymore?. Its been like this for quite a while now. Things I used to be super excited about don't even interest me anymore. Everything feels like lost hope; like literal end of the world. It feels like no matter what I do, I have already messed everything up to the point of no return. 
I don't feel like doing anything except sleeping it off.
But I don't even know what ""it"" is! 
Everyday trying to get even the simplest and minimal things done is a struggle. 
All the while this never ending big bag of guilt is on my shoulder. Guilt of not doing enough, not being enough. How do you get out of this? How do you not go further down the rabbit hole? 

what do you do?"
1,"Always a new source of depression. I was thinking the things that made me real depressed in my teen years now don’t bother me. Then my 20s depression was also different. 

It’s like there’s always new things to make you miserable."
1,"I think my brain is rotting.. I’m not sure how to explain this well but I’ll try as best as I can. 
All my life, I’ve experienced this feeling of confusion, dumbness and brain fog. Since I was a kid, I’ve experienced major anxiety and depression and I wonder if this has a lot to do with it? Ive always had a HUGE problem not being able to learn anything at school. Being in an environment with so many others allowed my anxiety to almost completely numb my brain out.  
My anxiety and stress got so bad in middle school that I developed psychosis (possible schizophrenia) for 3 years and I never told anyone about it. It really physically felt like my brain was changing form or melting.
In college, it was all the same. I’m 21 now, and It’s as if my confusion and IQ worsened so much. I couldn’t learn anything, including basic knowledge. When people would talk to me I couldn’t process it-I can’t even say a proper sentence correctly without pausing as I speak and having to try my hardest to word it correctly. I made so many unbelievably stupid mistakes, I became so forgetful and my movements slowed. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be successful at school or learn how to drive a car. There’s no motivation for me to make a plan for my future or maintain my hygiene. I don’t know what to do. I am really convinced that my brain may be rotting. My brain always becomes confused and then starts to ache really bad like it’s shutting down. I feel like dying because I don’t think I can ever be cured from something like this. It’s actually like my mind is dying and disintegrating as I’m still alive. Am I even making sense? I’ve never been vocal about this-I’ll accept any insight and advice on this, please."

I had chemo and since have had to be quirintened for going on 6 weeks now and it just has shown me how little impact i make. My Mom, gma , a freind and 2 co workers have been the only ones to contact me to make sure im okay. I just dropped off the planet and this is it. Its all making me feel so alone."
1,"Anyone else feel like their true potential can never be realized or appreciated in this world?. There just isn't real or fair opportunity for so many ppl. Why do I need to go on bc my parents thought they were capable of bringing life into this shitty world they also thought was good enough for offspring. I only am ever hated on. Some ppl don't want to see you successful and only want to see you suffer. Why go on for a life that will only get worse and accomplish nothing just to die. I feel like I have nothing left. No motivation whatsoever to be social again. No motivation to be creative again. To others I am worse than a barcode. I wish I could take someone's place, someone who actually wants this chance at life."
1,"The invisible woman: is it depression ?. I am not sure I have ever said this to anyone other than my abusive ex. I think I have depression, or severe mood changes? Honestly I don't know.

I am 10/10 afraid to share my true thoughts and feelings with basically anyone, I am so afraid ofettimf the world know me, I want to have connections with people but everyone has been so shit to me. I havent had a bad life, I played sports in college I'm averagely pretty, I have a great job, and I'm even going for my master's degree. However I cant help but feel like the world is against me, or that I'm invisible and worthless to everyone. I struggle everyday with feeling like I matter to no one. Sometimes I wish I would just die, but then i think of how devastated my parents would be, it would kill them really. I feel like my whole life is never mine, I feel the weight of other emotions so heavily that I am overwhelmed. Is is fear of disappointing someone? What makes me feels so worthless, even when I think I have so much worth to give?  What is this feeling of dying to give others help but unable to step from my crippling fear of remaining invisible even when I step out of my shell.... the only thing people ever noticed me for was how athletic I was, now I just feel as if no one sees me.  I don't think of suicide, but I think how over this life I am.

I am the invisible women."
1,"I just stuck in this pathetic limbo. I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do with my life. I’m stuck I. This pathetic state where I’m too depressed to live but don’t have the power to die. I get these depressive dips almost, where for about two hours I’ll get really sad, and nothing else matters, just kill me. But then I’ll have my common self, where I’m just kinda sad and fed up all the time, but not to the point of where’s I can’t get out of bed. Then I’ll have a 30 uplift, where I’ll not feel sad or anything,mane I’ll think how stupid and selfish I am for saying I want to die and shit when I’m not even depressed and bullshit like that. It’s almost as bad as the depressive periods, since it makes me feel more worthless, so when I go to my day-to-day I’m just that but more sad. I’ve been cutting my arm a lot more now, and I can’t stop anymore. I started cutting for control and relief, but they’re the two things I’ve lost. I’m considering it now. With genuine eyes. I think I’m in my day-to-day right now, but on the decline. I pray in my low point I won’t do sometching stupid."

1,"Mother died. Going crazy from guilt/regret.. My mother had cancer for 3.5 years and had already gone through one bout in hospice, which she eventually left because she got so much better. I think her long illness and repeated improvements lulled me into a false sense of ""theres still time"".

My mother was put into hospice again on Friday April 3rd and told she had a ""few weeks"". This time I knew it was for real. I saw her on Saturday and on Monday and she seemed to be doing pretty well and she texted me on Wednesday saying that she felt she was going to linger a week or two more. Instead she died on Friday the 10th. 2 days after that text. She was only home a week before she died.

My sister flew in to be with her the second she was released from the hospital and put into hospice. I work in an ER so I am considered high risk in these COVID19 times so I just visited 2 times from the day she came home from the hospital to the day she died and both times I had to maintain some distance, I couldn't hug her, and my sister didn't want me staying very long (1-2 hours). I tried to see her on Thursday but she said she was too tired for a ""visit"". So I finally got fed up with not seeing her more and I applied for FMLA so I could be with her 100% until she died. Make more memories. Take care of her. Not just be a ""visitor"" but be her \*daughter\*. But the day I FINALLY decided to do that, the next day, thinking she had at least another week for me to be with her, she suddenly crashed and died. I waited too long. WHY DID I WAIT AT ALL? Why didn't I understand how little time she had left? Why did it even matter? Why didn't I call my work the second she got released from the hospital and said, ""I'm not coming back to work until she has passed, no matter how long that takes"" or just quit and told them to use my PTO to cover my last 2 weeks. The stupidest thing is, I was going to quit my job soon anyways because I'm going to grad school. I think I just got hung up on being afraid to lose my health insurance, or being unemployed for months, or thinking I couldn't be gone for weeks (when i thought she would last weeks). But none of those things actually mattered. I didn't even have a financial incentive to stay because my dad told me he would cover my expenses until I left for grad school if I wanted to quit. I thought about FMLA but didn't apply for it until it was too late.

I managed to get there in time to say my goodbyes, I got to tell her I loved her and she managed to say it back, and I stayed with her in her final hours although she was heavily sedated. But I cant forgive myself for not being there with her in those last days. I COULD'VE BEEN THERE, getting hugs and watching tv with her and saying goodnight to her in person every single night.....and I wasn't. She probably thought I cared more about my stupid fucking job than her.

I just don't understand how stupid I was. Why did I keep delaying leaving my job, when I was going to quit soon anyways? Why did I assume she had weeks, I should've known she could die at any minute? Why didn't I press my sister to let me be there more? Why was I ever content with ""visits""? Why didn't I even consider being there 24/7 until it was too late?

I have no real good excuse for why I didn't quit, why I wasn't there with her. I honestly don't understand what I was thinking.

I could’ve been there and I wasn't. Day after day. I'll never be able to forgive myself. All the time and memories lost. I could've gotten hugs. I can't even remember the last time I got a hug from my mother because of COVID19.

I'd give anything to go back. Anything. I feel like I’m going insane from the regret.

I miss my mom."
1,"How do you get motivated?. I’ve hit rock bottom. I’m starting to honestly believe the world will be better off without me. I stopped taking my meds, I’m ready to stop going to therapy. I don’t have a reason to fix myself anymore. 

Does anyone have advice on how to find motivation to get better?"
1,I missed my appointment. I missed my appointment for anti depression. I'm going to cut my wrists now
1,"Need advice on helping a friend. I’m sorry in advance if this post is long and I am so grateful to anyone who is willing to help 

My friend has struggled with depression for a long time, and they seem to be getting worse. I had a long chat with them recently and it is very clear to me that they are doing extremely poorly. They admitted to not being able to abstain from self harm at all, drinking to try and feel better, and saying that their life has no meaning and they will never be happy. They have a therapist who they don’t like and believe that therapy can’t help them. I don’t want to go into too many specifics because I don’t know if they use this subreddit, but I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m not doing the best myself so I feel as though I can’t give the best advice. Since we had this talk they’ve been even more distant and I’m getting really worried. We are both in our later teen years also so I feel really unqualified to help them. Their parents know that they struggle but they have never opened up about the self-harm or the fact that they are doing this bad. I don’t know if I should contact their parents or if that’s a bad idea because if not handled well it will only alienate them more. I’m at a complete loss for what to do. 

I can pm with more information if anything will help. If anyone has any useful advice I would appreciate it so much."
1,Am struggling to breath and there is no longer hope. 2020. The year I found out death really is the answer. If I wasn't afraid of the consequences of suicide I would have done it a lot of breakdowns ago. I can't wait until something ends me. Only way I'll be with my mother again. I can't wait. sweet sweet death.
1,"I'm not at risk but I want to hear your opinion. Trigger warning possible

I have had depression in some amount my whole life. Recently I have had a breakup and some triggers bring up my past. I have had a rough few weeks. Anyways I just tied a noose because I had some extra rope lying around (suspicious I know but I was just messing around) I tightened it around my neck to send to a friend. I was going to make a joke, ""like my new tie?"" 

The strange thing is it felt so good to tighten around my neck. I felt the world slow down and my heart started beating faster. I could feel my vision going fuzzy. I took it off after a few seconds but now I just want to do it more. I realized how easy it would be to kill myself and end all of the complicated BS I deal with. Death is so easy and simple. 

I'm not going to go through with it so dont worry about that. I know I'll get better as I always do but right now I dont know how to explain what I'm feeling. I feel like cutting or choking myself or something. I won't do that because I know it will haunt me for my whole life but it would feel so good. Anyone have ideas on how to cope? I'll probably end up over eating"
1,"How should I handle this?. The last time I saw my crush of 5 years was after graduating. That was around 2017 and a year ago I pretty much cut all feelings for her after thinking about all the rejections (5 times in total over the course of these 5 years). Because I pretty much wasted 5 years on her I was just too blind to see and too weak to let go.
After I cut all connection and feelings in early 2019 my life improved sort of, not by much but it improved. Today while grocery shopping I met her in the supermarket. We exchanged smiles and a quick ,,hi,, before going on with our shopping. The moment I saw her all the feelings, anger and depressive thoughts that I had over the years came back instantly and pretty much continued to fck with my head. Now I don't know what to do anymore, what's the mission now? I don't want to focus 2 years on recovering not being able to do nothing due to depression and me getting eaten alive by my own thoughts like what happened after graduation...

How do I avoid thinking about the girl I had a crush on for 5 years now since 2013...

We somehow agreed to stay friends after grad but some time after that we pretty much became strangers to each other and now I don't know what to do...Should I just toughen it out like I'm used to until it goes away?

I can answer anything that I might have missed, in the comments if it helps to find an answer..."

I have a shitty family situation and I have no time for me literally I have to be an aunt/nanny and a student 100% and when I want time for me oh no it to damn late then when I want to go out they won't let me, I have no friends I mean I have but they don't talk to me often and I know I should talk to them but my depression tells me I'm just a bother and uhh I feel I want to drop out and idk wish I could die but I can't"
1,"Successful treatment of Dysthymia?. I would wager that I suffer from dysthymia from early childhood, but due to the nature of the disorder as it is hard to diagnose I am only being seriously treated for around 5 years. I am 25.  
As I am descending into another episode of double depression, I was wondering if anyone can share an experience of overcoming such disorder. I feel as if i'm locked into a cycle: I am fighting my way out, and for a while it seems like the medication have helped me stabilize, but I just dive down again.

Returning with less and less strength each time, with a lower and lower starting point it seems. I really hope I make it through this one, But honestly I am both exhausted and hopeless. If you are willing to share, I would be glad to hear how you broke the cycle, or how are you still going through it.

To quote one of my favorite songs: "" I am furthest from the sun, closest to roots of the tree.  
You're not the only one under shade suffering. ""

Thank you."
1,"I just don’t want to be here anymore. It hurts so much, everyday I’m in pain. My OCD causing constant over thinking. Almost every second of everyday I’m doing checking rituals. I have magical thinking which means I think I can make things happen with my thoughts if I don’t do certain stuff. I can’t enjoy anything because as soon as I do I feel guilty for stopping obsessing about the thoughts. Then I get intrusive thoughts about the thing. So I just flick back through the same apps everyday, stuck in my head trying to control my hole life. I try to go for a walk everyday but I’m overthinking the whole time. Literally anything triggers me. Any decision I try to make ocd comes in and tries to force me into something I don’t want to do. I want toast? No ocd wants me to have cereal or something bad will happen. I want to message a friend? ocd wants me to send exactly the right message, normally something I don’t even want to say. Then I end up talking and talking and probably annoying people.

Then on top of the is the feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough. From years of bullying at school. Then the guilt for the nasty ways I treated my friends because I wanted to look cool so made fun of them. Knowing if I didn’t my best friend would get mad at me. Saying I didn’t like her for hanging round with them.

And finally there’s the years of abuse from my alcoholic mother. Leaving me on my own at night. Coming home all bruised and bleeding. Forcing me to hug her when I didn’t want to. Calling me a freak, a bitch, telling me to fuck off. Gaslighting me constantly. Trying to kill her self in front of me and screaming at me to give her pills.

I’m just so broken. Life was getting better. My mother’s in prison now. I thought things were looking up but my ocd was worse. And then this lockdown and I’m backing to thinking “how do I do another potential 60 years of this hell that is life”

And I know this post is ranty, but I needed to get my feelings out. And no I’m not going to do anything. I’m too scared to kill myself. I don’t even want to die I just want the pain to stop. I want to finally be happy."
1,"When will the side effects fade away?. Hi guys, I'm on day 8 of 50 mg venlafaxine. I feel so anxious I can't function. I feel like I want to scream and cry at the same time. It's uncomfortable to be inside my own body right now. All I do is lie on my bed and wait for it to stop. When will it stop? Is it normal?"
1,I hate myself.. Quarantine is really fucking with my mental health and being in the house all day with no social interaction is killing me. I can’t stand myself anymore.
1,"What am I supposed to do now. When I got 11 years old I got depression, I don't want to talk about why I got depression at 11 because it's kinda embarrassing.

At 12 years old shit got real... A lot of depression came from school. I can't do school work anymore because it's so frustrating.

I can't even do my hobbies anymore.

There's one other reason why I am so depressed, but I don't want to talk about it.

I'm still 12 and right now all I do in life is sit In bed watch YouTube videos or watch porn and masturbait.

I don't really know how to describe the stuff I'm going through.

 Also English is not my first language so my English might be bad."
1,"anxious and probably schizophrenic thoughts? idk but needed to write this down. I’ve been wondering what my real reason for committing suicide would be. I’d like to think that depression itself isn’t that big of an issue for me and wouldn’t be the reason for potential suicide.

I feel like if I ever did it, it would be because of the constant arguing and switching in my head, and also my consistently worsening grip on reality. It’s driving me insane and I hate living like this. This is mostly a post I’m making while having anxiety, so no I’m not talking about committing suicide right now I’m talking about the future.

I have a LOT of potential, and I have a lot of plans and methods that could get me successful and rich in the future, I know that and I know other people have told me that, the problem is I have no motivation to. And even if I do, first of all I’d have to get better.

What if I get better, end up thinking everything is fine, I move on with everything and eventually find a girlfriend, and I relapse into these same thoughts? Even if I do get better, I’m going to constantly live with the fear of a trigger activating and me lashing out.

The only reason I am seeking therapy right now is because some people believe I can be helped, even though I continue to believe I’m completely out of reach and beyond help at this point. I think there really is just a point where someone has been through so much that nobody is capable of helping them. 

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a big deal if I didn’t have certain triggers, because then my dark thoughts could be easily drowned out, but no, my mom had to be a despicable piece of shit and treat me horribly. And of course, dad was never there, and when he was, he was raping my mom and forced me to watch, so god knows what fucking psychological impact that had on my brain.

I’m not sure I can even push this shit out of my head. I’ve tried overpowering my triggers and telling myself “it’s fine it’s whatever it doesn’t matter you’ll get past it” and it just makes the triggers worse. 

It’s to the point where any amount, even an insignificant amount, of any representation of anxiety from rejection and abandonment, can set me off. Even if I wasn’t self isolating, I legitimately don’t understand basic, normal human interaction and I can barely even talk to anyone properly. I don’t know what normal friendships and relationships are. I’ve never known, and I don’t know what love is and I can’t love, which I’ve explained before I think.

Sorry I can’t really stick to one train of thought with these posts. I’ll be really surprised if someone can somehow get into my head, get past all the split personalities, get past all the manipulation and lying and fake personas, and convince ME that I can get better, that life is worth living, and that someday I won’t feel like such a danger."
1,"I made a hole in one of the doors in my home today. I’ve been WFH and forced to live with a parent who believes they’re going to die from this, between my uncontrollable OCD, them yelling at me for struggling to be able to run some errands and my job while they’re around, not going outside, the stress of my job and the hopelessness; I snapped. My parent made the first move. She slammed the door in my face. In anger, I elbowed it back. However, my elbow was too sharp and made a dent. Neither one of us knows what to do anymore and we’re both telling each other that we’re going to kill ourselves. I don’t how much longer I can keep doing this job, I don’t know how much longer before I take a bottle of Advil, lock the door and go to bed."

So i was diagnosed with depression not to long ago but i’ve felt I’ve had it for much longer but then my wonderful best friend said “you know maybe we could try this out” and then I felt so happy I came out to my parents too and they were super supportive and then my life just felt easier I still have depression I still have those days but my life just seems a little brighter now 

Thanks for reading just thought I’d share this to say there’s always hope have a nice day"
1,Doctor on demand. Has anyone attempted to talk to a therapist via doctor on demand? I am having a hard time dealing with and processing my life events. Considering talking to a professional as I can’t do this on my own anymore. Want to know if doctor on demand for therapy has had good results for anyone else.
1,My brother gave me a hug and I almost cried. It had been so long since I had a sincere hug from anyone that I couldn’t handle it. So I guess hugs are good.
1,"What are your thoughts on social media and mental health?. I constantly debate whether social media is good or bad for my mental health. 

Part of me thinks that it is toxic and just leads to me feeling worse about myself by comparison, but another part of me feels like if I delete everything then I’m just feeding into the social isolation of depression and isolating myself from my friends.

I’ve tried periods without it, recently a period of 6 months, but I always end up coming back to it and when I do I feel even more out of touch and out of the loop with my friends. 

Does anyone have any insight/experience?"
1,"just want someone anyone to understand. no one gets it, the pain, the crying, the dark thoughts. it gets too much for me. everyone thinks ""you are lazy"" or ""you aren't trying hard enough"". just because I don't have physical symptoms of being ill doesn't make it any less harder."
1,"i'm afraid of never getting out of here and few more problems. i'm 24, from poor country and poor family with alcoholic father. i currently share a room with my mom and sister. and theres no way out of that situation except for my fathers death, but even then i wont be able to move out and live on my own... not in this country with broken economy. and not with my education that ends on high school, because i was too depressed to do anything in school and i cant go to university to actually get any degree that couls guarantee me good job. i cant even pay any course... and i dont want to work like i currently am either.

it all drives me crazy. i would probably commit if it werent for the fact that i dont even care about dying anymore. i just dont know what to do, im lost and theres no one to help or support me or direct me in a proper way. i dont want to leave mom with that bastard either. chances of getting rid of him are 0, especially during pandemic. its just pathetic hoping that shit will get better, except it never did. not for as long as i live. 

all i want in life is to be able to afford living in bigger home and all my stupid whims like takeout or fencing lessons. i want to travel a lot too. and i wanted to study archeology - something that probably would grant me job with shit pay but i always wanted to do that. and because im poor, because i cant afford anything, because of my pathetic life situation thats just the worst combination of unlucky events i cant do either and i know deep inside that i will always be stuck like this, in this ugly town and with no friends or even boyfriend (bc lol i never had either, not even one friend irl, no one even had a crush on me. hell, i couldnt go to school trips bc we couldnt afford them). i just... dont know anything anymore"
1,"I hope my new antidepressants cause me to actually have the balls to kill myself. I’m tired of this. 12 years of misery. After being skeptical of starting antidepressants again after getting off them a few months ago, im starting a new medication. I’m hoping that it will cause me to actually go through with killing myself, cause I hear that some antidepressants can cause one to be suicidal. Maybe this is the push I need"
1,"Worst day of my life. So the one friend that I can trust to talk about shit with, just told my parents that I’m suicidal. I’m not pissed at her as I know she meant well but now feel like I can’t trust anyone. I would have rather told my parents myself eventually as opposed to having them find out from someone else then barrage me with questions. It’s not their fault as they clearly have no idea how to deal with depression/suicidal thoughts but it’d like they managed to say every bad thing. Everyone involved just wants what is best for me but I can’t help feel angry at them all. It’s understandable as my mum thought I was happy for the last two years, but she keeps trying to tell me how it’s just temporary. She also keeps wanting to know how I self harm as my friend told her about that as well. It feels like everyone is against me and I’m just alone and I just don’t want to go on anymore."
1,"This is too much. Everyday it’s something else. I’m getting pushed so far and nobody realizes how deep I am in depression. I don’t want to be sad, I don’t want to hurt myself. But my head is crazy I can’t even begin to explain the thoughts I have and I feel insane because I know it’s in my head but it’s still there. I don’t know if anyone understands. I’m at a constant battle with myself and I don’t know how to make it stop. I just want to be normal"
1,"Tips for helping my depressed friend?? i want to support but i'm not sure if i know how to :(. My (23f) closest friend (21f) has revealed to me that she is depressed, does not have the energy to eat & feels the weight of the world on her shoulders. She really does have a lot on her plate, a narcissistic creep of a dad, a lazy alcoholic mother that has seemed to have resigned from motherly duties (they have recently seperated & she lives w/ her mother) many animals (birds, horses, dogs) to feed everyday, a younger brother to look after & a boyfriend that does sweet fuck all to help or support her.   
She is not the type to feel helped/supported by advice, so how can i help? is there anything i can say to make her feel better? She isn't very affectionate either.   
The help that i feel comfortable giving her is not the type of help that she would really appreciate & i am worried. i don't know what to do... i want to be more adequate when it comes to dealing with mental health & i love my friend :( i don't know what to do guys, please any advice would be so appreciated."
1,"What's worse?. Those days where you can't get out of bed, thinking there is no point because you will waste the day anyways. Sleeping 12-15 hours on and off and getting up groggy, feeling no different than if you had not been sleeping. Still feeling tired both physically and mentally?

Or

Those nights where you get 2-4 hours of sleep. You lie down early but all you can think about is if you have already had your highest of highs. Maybe it just doesn't get better than this. You are so damn sleepy but your head will not quit. You have those dark circles and bags under your eyes, and your mind doesn't even stop as if it won't let go of that feeling?"
1,Rage bubbles inside of me. I have been holding everything in for so long and I just want to explode and let all of it out. I always had anger issues when I was younger and would lash out immaturely and break things. As I’ve gotten older I’ve tried hard to change into a much more cool headed and calm person. Which I feel like I have done successfully to some degree. However I feel that recently I have been having anger issues again yet it takes everything to keep it all in. I still try to portray myself as a calm person but I am always so irritable and angry. What am I supposed to do? I am enraged most of the day yet it takes all of my energy to keep it all hidden and not let it out. Listening to music helps me but at what point do I get to feel things again besides anger. I can’t cry even if I want to. I genuinely can’t see how death isn’t the answer to all my problems. It checks all of the boxes.

1,"Quarantine got me being rebellious when I'm really not. This quarantine thing really got me acting up. I'm a 15 year old girl, and since this corona virus things have been going downhill. I've had major body image issues, used self harm to punish myself if I wasn't a certain weight, and got diagnosed with clinical depression about a year ago. I have asthma, so that's why my mother is really really strict about going outside right now. I get it, but I haven't been outside my backyard for a good month, and ot's really suffocating. I know everyone is going thru this, but my friends being my support system and me not being able to see them has made my mental state decline rapidly and has me cutting again. Also I've never been the rebellious type. Getting drunk a few times  was all I've ever done which could be considered 'rebellious'. But since a week I just wanna go my own way. I snuck out of the house at 3am a couple of times to drink, had my first cigarette and did drugs for the first time. All within a week. I know it's bad and I should stop asap but I just can't if that makes sense. This is the only thing that's keeping me kind of 'sane' rn.

1,"Waves of depression. I don't know if its just me but my depression comes in waves. Sometimes i would just wake up feeling like a pathetic loser after which I don't want to get out my bed. Sometimes, even the most obscure things triggers memories of my ex and absolutely wrecks me for days. Sometimes its just a feeling of emptiness and that feeling of ""what the fuck is even the point"". Then it goes away magically after a few days only to return days later.

Also, I've never been to a therapist so far because I feel that my symptoms are mild. But sometimes I just think everything would be so much better if life just ended right here for me. I am considering going to a therapist after the covid 19 situation calms down. Can someone explain how it seeing a therapist helps? Like what benefits does it bring assuming no medication."
1,"My senior year in high school I just gave up. This is really hard to explain but I’m just posting this because I need to write out my thoughts and feel normal. 

I thought my senior year would be fun first of all but I was pressured through my parents to still take a few difficult classes with a lot of homework. The summer before the year I started smoking weed 2-5 days a week as well. Applying to college was extremely stressful because I honestly thought my grades weren’t good enough to go where I wanted to. I began to constantly daze out and fall behind in class and not do homework, I would just sit there and be quiet. I saw my classmates having a fun year while all I did was smoke weed once my fall sport ended. I honestly feel like I have no personality and no hobbies or interests, I just feel so boring like I’m a side character who doesn’t fit in anywhere. Weed was all I cared about and I became anxious that it’s chronic use had permanently turned me into a zombie. Right before this corona virus shit I started getting romantic with someone but now he has a girlfriend and doesn’t talk to me. I just have so much regret and guilt and if I could go back I would do things so different but now it’s all over. Right when things started getting interesting and different in life they took a turn for the worse and got put on hold."

1,"I watched my fiancé die one year ago and I’ve completely emotionally checked out.. I’ve felt the worst pain and shock a human can endure without dying (though I tried). Once you’ve been to that depth, everything else is nothing. 

It’s a blessing in a way. Nothing hurts anymore. But nothing makes me happy either. 

I’m all on my own. My family has given up on me they quit checking up. My friends think I’m fine so they quit checking up. 

It is what it is. 

We were together 5 years. He was riding our motorcycle. I was driving behind him. I went into shock after seeing his fat and bones and muscles exposed. Didn’t say my goodbyes, could barely breathe. Surgeon said he held on for an hour. 

He used to hit me when he was mad. He cheated on me. We’d had a fight right before it happened. I’d been pregnant two weeks prior. 

I literally cannot focus on anything anymore. My family and friends are all anti therapy and anti meds so I’ve been trying not to go. They tell me not to then they leave me alone. I am always in a dense fog on my own here. I cannot remember the feeling of joy. Nor the feeling of sadness. I just exist, pretending to have emotions so people think I’m ok and so I don’t make them uncomfortable. 

It is what it is."
1,"What is this?. I’m not sure if this falls under the category of depression. But does anyone else feel undeserving of good things? Like when good things start happening I always feel like what did I do to deserve this? Why me and when is it going to go bad to not being this good?  I don’t think I’m a bad person or anything, I have my faults like everyone else but I feel guilty and undeserving of good things happening to me and I don’t know why."
1,"I get flashes and vague visions of the ""ideal setting"" I could be in. Since I can remember feeling depressed, I've struggled with wishing I was somewhere else. Unable to appreciate the now, always assuming there is more to life and never able to accept things the way they are. I think back to the perfectly trimmed memories I have of days before I felt this way and I disregard any notion of nostalgia and assume that in those moments, I felt as happy as those memories seem. I am always chasing that impossible feeling of peace and satisfaction and it often comes in the form of flashbulb visions

I can be thinking about or doing whatever, and a random flash of an unknown setting will commandeer my mind for a second. There are some that reoccur and some that are fresh every time. Sometimes its just a staircase of a home that is incandescently lit, sometimes its a night at home in an apartment I've never seen. Just like a dream, there can be context for the vision. This comes in the form of details about my life at the time. It could be 20 years form now with a family that I love. Whatever it is, it's random and and torturous. Its like a fishing line with bait that is constantly held above my head, taunting me for my inability to attain satisfaction. I don't know what these are trying to tell me but they are a constant reminder that I am not satisfied with what I have. 

I often get lost in the fleeting image that has been left behind after it happens. I struggle with a near obsession with escapism in my lower moods and these visions walk hand in hand with that. I spiral into a jealousy for a dream that is impossible and with every jealous mood I grow farther from accepting reality as it is, allowing me to finally be happy or at peace.

Does anyone else feel similar or experience anything of the sort? I was just writing this to get my thoughts into words but I would appreciate some discussion. I feel very alone in this."

When I was finishing high school I had a very strange last semester, I got dumped right before my exams, met the love of my life (were still together) a week later after that person dumped me, anyway while we got together somebody (some random computer dude who also helped ruin my life, was not someone from my school but was someone from Around the world) was very jealous of the fact I wouldn’t date them and proceeded to edit and released fake nudes of me from my accounts because I wouldn’t date said person. (There was one video where it was me topless but that was it that was real) From there everything sort of fell apart and that’s when all the bullying began in my school. Many people told me how disgusting of a person I was how I have no respect etc. I thought I at least had my little group of friends... no these group of people called me the worst names commented on my weight, commented on my annoyance, my breath apparently stank like vagina and Incredibly sexist slurs. When I found out about the comments I confronted them and they told me to leave the group.. from
There I heard that they had a party for my departure and were waiting to kill myself so they can party because of the fact I was dead, after that I no longer talk to anyone and I think that’s why I hate myself as much as I do and my boyfriend I am with now is literally the only reason I’m still alive.. this is just the main part many little things happened that made the situation worse.

I will also add I’ve had issues for years that we’re never clearly diagnosed, I’m on Zoloft for depression and anxiety for about 5 years now. I also can’t do anything without feeling like I’m. Not good enough and I can’t be around people whatsoever without getting incredibly nervous around them.

This happened 2 years ago but I still have insanely massive issues from this massive trust problems, I still feel suicidal and I hate myself profusely I saw the main girl and guy who bullied me on Instagram being happy and I honestly felt so sick I just want them both to die a painful death. I have also considered dumping my amazing boyfriend just because of how suicidal I’ve been and I honestly feel as if I may act upon it.. I don’t want to drag him down with me... Any suggestions?

I posted almost the same thing on another thread, if not allowed please remove"
1,"Experiences with Viibryd or Cymbalta?. So far I've tried Effexor (no effect), Wellbutrin (no effect), and Zoloft. I took Zoloft at varying dosages, at some points alongside Wellbutrin. Zoloft helped with the extreme lows of depression, but I still felt significantly depressed in addition to feeling numb/flat, almost unable to fully experience happiness. I have been off medication entirely for around 6 months. In the last couple of months, I started going to the gym almost everyday, taking omega 3s, taking vitamin D, occasionally using light therapy, and trying to get my sleep schedule together. I was definitely still depressed but felt wayyy better than when I was on Zoloft. 

My mental health changed for the worse very suddenly though when an ex came back into my life (bringing up old wounds that haven't healed) at the same time this pandemic began. I ended up losing my job. I've been sleeping around 12 hours and once I wake up, lay in bed all day. I constantly feel like I'm going to cry, I've tried my best to continue exercising but I'm finding it very difficult. Yesterday I went for a walk/jog on a trail and ended up crying my eyes out (luckily I was alone in the middle of nowhere haha). I don't necessarily have a plan, but I think very often about killing or hurting myself. It's something I've caught myself fantasizing about often, even though I know it's not something I could go through with. 

I had a Facetime appointment with my PCP today. She prescribed me Viibryd, along with Zofran for the nausea side effects. She said if it was too expensive, we could try Cymbalta instead. I haven't gone to pick it up yet, but the Walgreens website says it's $71 with my insurance. I found a coupon I saw people mention online and am going to try to use it. I'm wondering though if Viibryd is worth the cost?  I've read good things about Viibryd from people who failed to respond to different antidepressants. I'm also wondering how people who don't respond to antidepressants like Cymbalta? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Is Viibryd worth the cost for people who don't respond to antidepressants? How does Cymbalta compare?"
1,Social distancing is normal for me. I think I’ll just make it permanent. I just don’t fit in with others and it’s better just to stay away. Only socialize enough to make money and get food.
1,"Is anyone else getting more depressed because of the lockdowns?. I don't know how to explain it except for the fact that I love being outside. And now that I am constantly indoors with nothing to do but school work and review cold cases and all that, I feel trapped and depressed. Things I haven't wanted to think about are constantly at the forefront of my mind and I can't get them to leave me alone. I can't sleep. I can barely eat. I feel alone in my group home and I feel like I can't get out. I just want to be outside, and being inside 24/7 is honestly making my depression worse. Has anyone been feeling the same and does anyone have any advice?"
1,"It is what it is I guess. My greatest fear as a child was always being lonely. I’ve felt lonely all my life, even tho I had a few good friends throughout the years. Self harmed a bit, did whatever drugs I could get my hands on, and just tried to fit in with the people around me. But for some reason I just was never like them. Now I’m 23 and I’m as alone as I’ve ever been and my childhood fear has been realized. And I think I’m still I’m okay. I’m think I’m stronger than I anticipated. However it’s so weird how the smallest things can send me tailspinning. 

It snowed last night where I am. I made a Facebook post expressing my annoyance, as well did one of my friends. He got 12 likes, I got 2. Such a petty, nonsense reason to ruin my day. But it actually brought me to tears. That’s so damn stupid because I know in my head that it doesn’t matter. It’s just fucking Facebook. It may just be that I’m drunk tho. 

I hate that this seems to happen so often and that I struggle to get a grip sometimes. All I’ve ever wanted is to be happy but it seems the more I focus on that, the more I recognize that I’m not. 

I’m still hopeful I can turn this ship around someday so I’m trying to keep my head up anyway that I can. Hope you guys do the same."
1,"My suicidal/depressed GF hates me/pushes me away can meds save her?. Its been a very rough couple of months, especially with this corona forcing us to be together when she 'hates me'.

Quick summary: S.O. of three years has had a history of depression and I think it is very bad right now (seeing a psychiatrist this week, makes constant suicidal thoughts). Our first year was really great but she got pregnant accidentally, it was stressful but we moved in together and started making it work. Ever since she was pregnant, and even after baby our relationship has been on a downward trajectory (sometimes it had highlights).

Specifically some major things are our intimacy fell off a cliff (which has been huge for me, she says I am gross, doesnt find me attractive, 'not a real man' etc), she tears me down a lot, says I am stupid, lazy, NEVER wants to hug/kiss/hold hands, tells me she hates my family (we are living with them right now for free for the last half year, and they really went out of their way to try to make her feel welcome), doesnt like doing anything fun any more, ALWAYS wants to fight etc etc.

I am not perfect at all, and I have gone way out of my way to listen to her, to fix whatever she is angry about and all it does is make her want more and more. We had a huge fight (seems like 1/week honestly) where she saw I was texting my sister and friends asking for relationship advice and had some huge melt down that I 'betrayed her' and she took baby and drove a few hours to her parents and said she is never coming back and I can get baby in a week.

My question is can depression 'change' someone this much? She was once very loving, very caring, someone I ENJOYED being with. These days it feels like I am just care taking someone on the verge of admitted self-destruction. I feel trapped because we have a kid together. I truly want it to work out, but likewise if she really just 'hates me', doesnt want to hold hands, thinks I am so stupid and gross not sure what future there is. I am secretly hoping this isn't the 'real her'. Can you guys give me a little insight? Thanks"
1,"I don't know what to do anymore. I just won't be able to last much longer the way I am. I'm just soooo fucking tired of myself. I am unable to vent my negative emotions, so I just let them devour me. I'm the guy you go to when your world is falling apart and I will do everything I can to fix it, but I just can't fix my own world. My friends are trying to help me the same way I helped them, but I for some reason don't trust them. I know, that they are 100% trustworthy and I jad lots of ""deep"" moments with them, but I just can't get myself to trust them, so I can't get them to help me properly. Maybe it's because I don't know what the main problem is.
I would like to work out and build up some of my muscles, but because I don't see result I just give up on it even tho I know that if I keep going the results will start to pop up. I don't have any life goals expect get a family. Im missing love in my life, but it's because when I'm near a girl I just start panicking. I didn't have this problem when I was younger, but I do now... Why?

I hate who I am, but I love myself for who I am. I would love to be more assertive and not be the all out funny guy. But even when I'm trying I just can't change.

The trust issues I have are killing me, as I don't trust anyone. I don't trust my best friends who tell me all sort of things, from their very shameful stories to their failed pick up attempts. But I still don't trust them. I don't trust my family and I don't fucking know why.

I am all about not giving up, but I still give up on myself. 

I feel like I'm missing something in life, but I have no idea what it is.. Is it love? Is it some adrenaline? I just don't know.
I have shit loads of other problems, but the post would be very long.

In all honesty I just don't know anymore. I was trying to help people in this subreddit, but I can't even help myself.

If you read the whole thing than damn.. Thank you, but i don't really think that you can help. I'm really just trying to vent myself and see if I can figure out my next step in life."
1,"I often feel likes it's wrong for me to think that I'm depressed because I've never been diagnosed by a doctor.. I've taken tests, i cry all night, I stay in bed all day, I've self harmed and I think I am, but it feels wrong thinking I'm depressed without being diagnosed."
1,"I feel like I’m keeping a secret.. No one in my life knows I’m depressed, I guess I just have been for so long that I’m good at hiding it.

I’m a teen so I still live with my family and everyone is bad mental health wise to so I feel like if they know they’ll hit all unravel. My brother is depressed and is making it VERY known, so I don’t want to take away from that. My mom has had breakdowns in front of me sense I was a child and I act like a therapist for her. I’m not sure she’d even believe me. My sister is the oldest but has mild autism and can be very cruel. I just work so hard to keep everyone together and okay but I feel like I’m keeping a huge secret! Sorry for the rant, it’s just I can only talk about it here."
1,"The quarantine is finally getting to me. Been laid off for just under a month now. 

I see on here a lot that a lot of people tend to isolate themselves anyways due to their depression. I have the opposite problem.

I hang out with my family (My parents, grandma, and a couple cousins I'm close with) and my boyfriend. I work 48 hours a week and on my off days I'm usually with my boyfriend, at one of my parent's house or at one of my two cousin's houses.

This quarantine is making me crazy and I'm starting to get really depressed. I was still hanging out with my boyfriend and parents since I've been laid off but now that the stay at home order (I live in Michigan) is starting to get more strict I've been trying to be more safe. 

My parents last week told me they don't want me over anymore for a bit (which I understand). My boyfriend was over yesterday and I told him I don't want him over anymore for a bit (I don't really have a for sure time line right now, but probably until the stay at home order is no longer in effect) because he's still working. If he wasn't working I wouldn't mind but he works with other people and I know he's not being as cautious as he should be (Not wearing mask and gloves). 

I live alone and don't really have any hobbies. All I've been doing when I'm not with my parents is watching TV, reading, going for walks, and playing around on my phone. All of that stuff was getting boring anyways but I at least was able to break it up a bit by seeing my parents and having my boyfriend over. Now I can't do that so I'm just gonna be doing the same few boring things every day. I live alone too so I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I had the talk with my boyfriend Sunday and decided to have him stay over one more night (yesterday) and then no more for awhile. All I've done the last couple days is cry. All I think about is being alone the next few weeks. I feel like I'm not gonna make it. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for on this post. Just people to talk to, maybe support. Advice on things to do would probably be helpful too."
1,Stupid rant. I haven't washed my sheets in ages. My duvet has a massive patch of blood on it that I haven't cleaned up from yet another relapse. I haven't brushed my teeth in weeks. I may as well give up. I feel disgusting but I'm too depressed to do anything about it.
1,"My story.. Hello.

I didn't know if this is the right place, but I just need this to be heard.

&#x200B;

I am 15, and I right to you from the middle of a coronavirus lockdown. Luckily, where I live my country has been very proactive and has a had a low fatality rate, but that is besides the point. The national quarantine has given me time to reflect on my life and I don't know what to do with my findings.

&#x200B;

I come from a very loving family, who gave me the best life and love possible. But for as long as I can remember (until recently, more about that later) and according to my parents I had anxiety starting at age 2. This impacted me on a completely different scale that I can't barely begin to describe. I hated myself. I hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I walked. You name it, I hated it. This day to day alienation of myself as a person stopped me from living a normal child's life. I never signed up for sports, or for music or nothing. I never had the confidence to even take the chance - because I always felt that I was so wrong the less chance I had to be wrong the easier my life would be. I would turn down birthday parties and other social events because I didn't want to say something or be judged or make a bad impression etc. I remember in my first year of primary school, we were played this movie about an orphanage, who had a caregiver who banned all stuffed animals and teddys (probably not the best movie to show to a bunch of 5 years old). This lady hated them so much she would burn them and make the kids watch. I can vividly remember coming home that day, quiet, acting like it was a normal school day - but there was one thought I could never clear my head off. The burning of the toys. It wasn't until that night and from memory about two months after where I would hide my stuffed animals under my pillow when I went to bed, and kept myself awake - on guard almost in case such a thing happened to me as well. That is something my parents never found out about. At the age of five, I can remember being worried that my house was going to burn down in my sleep, to the point where I would keep all my most treasured belongings in plastic bags, ready to flee the house with. I can remember being scared that someone was going to murder me in my sleep or kidnap me and hold me hostage till the day I die. I suffered from much more intense and violent nightmares than my peers. The thing that I am still confused about, is that despite that I lives in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country and had a caring family, was that I still suffered from these things. I was so worried about things getting broken or something going wrong, that despite how desperately I wanted something to work or happen, I was too scared of failure to even try in the first place. I was always trying to be the happy/friendly kid, just for the sake of everyone else which made sadly too much sense at the time, but now it makes no sense..

&#x200B;

Like all people (i hope) we carry burdens. My burdens was that my grandfather died when I was seven, due to cancer. The day of his funeral, I was asked by my parents if I wanted to go and I was so worried about looking weak and upset, that I went to school like it was a normal day, while the rest of my family faced something I can't even imagine now. I remember hating myself for years and years over that decision, because I loved him to bits and I never got the chance to say goodbye. My only memory of him is me returning home from school that day, and my dad showing ""program"" and me seeing his photo on the front page. I have never been to his grave since because a) I am to scared to ask my parents where it is because I am worried about opening up and b) the fear that it will worsen my feelings now. My lack of attendance at his funeral ate me away inside for years, I remember weeks on end where I would cry myself to sleep in silence each night, but never told my parents and still haven't. It was only when I had a breakdown in I think at the start of Grade 8 when I only told my mum half the story, the regret. Not the amount of pain it caused me. I don't think I'll ever be able to tell them because it sounds just too pathetic. 

&#x200B;

It wasn't the middle of Grade 8, that I began to get a grip back on my life. At my school, in eight grade it was compulsory to take a performing arts subject, this could either be music, art, drama or dance. You could either do two arts for one semester each or one for the whole academic year. So I choose 1 semester of drama and 1 semester on dance. I only choose these because I didn't know what else to do. These classes were mixed gender, which I found really hard because for Grade 1-5 I was at a mixed gender school and then 6-7 I was at a boys only. I found it hard because I had barely settled in and any sense of security or even a wall to hide behind was completely removed. I found the first few weeks of the course really hard, could barley look anyone straight in the eyes and mumbled my way through every social situation, even if it was a simple ""Hey! How are you?"". I just couldn't do it. I remember considering dropping out and changing to music, and my mum said to me ""Just give it some time, it will be fine."" And I have been so happy that I listened to that advice. I owe my happiness and emotional freedom in life to my drama teacher, she pushed me and pushed me, to achieve confidence and it payed off. It was so successful to the point where I changed to a full year course, took for the whole year in Grade 9 and the same in Grade 10. I even signed up for the school's musical which sadly got cancelled, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

However, despite that I now have been dealing with the same sort of issues/dreams/constant pessimism again like when I was five. Recently, I have been so worried about death due to the coronavirus that on a frequent level I am having dreams involving comas, death of whole family etc. I seem to be more and more often wishing I wasn't who I am. On a frequent scale, I think to myself ""Imagine how good my life would be if I was born in the UK"" etc. Sometimes I wish I am a celebrity or sadly just someone who gets heaps of attention. 

&#x200B;

I know that I just dumped a lot of stuff on you guys but here are the main questions I need answered please:

&#x200B;

* How do I make up for that lost time, I spent worrying about everything?
* What do I do about my grandfather.
* What do I do about wishing I was someone else.

Like I said, I don't know if this is the right place, but your input would mean so much."
1,"What is wrong with me, why no one likes me?. What is wrong with me, why no one likes me?   
Why I'm always the different one?   
I want to socialize or meet people but everyone lies to me and doesn't wanna meet no matter what...   
Even if it's not quarantine I'm spending all my free time on the computer alone.   
I have no idea what to do."
1,"When will it get better? Did it got better for any of you?. I've struggled with depression since I was a teen. I've dealt with anxiety, destructive friendships, fear of going out of my house,bullying, a bitter divorce who left me as the only one to take care of my mom emotionally so I had to hide my feelings just to avoid my mom to get sad. In fact, when I finally hit rock bottom was so bad that I wished for my death. 

I've come out of them thanks to having friends and the improvement of the situation of me and my mom. But since, last year depression returned. First, it was realising how I chose a career that I ended up hating, then graduating and being unable to find a job. Then realising how my friendships had started to fade away as they are beginning to have relationships and it made me worry about a near future when I will be the only lonely guy of the group. 

It doesn't help that I feel my sexuality is a nightmare. I pray every night to be cured. I've been to lgbt groups but I just doesn't feel related to the things there, if anything it made me feel worse to be with people who put their sexuality as their main personality trait and it doesn't help that I live in such an homophobic country that coming out would cost me even the relationship with my mom, the only true love I have.  I don't think life would be better if I was straight as I already struggle with sharing my feelings and I'm not a very romantic person but at least I could live a normal life like the ones my friends are already having. Love is nothing more than an ilussion for sex. Isn't that's the reason why so many marriages fall apart?

And I don't think it will get better, if anything it will get worse as soon as my friends start to get married and having children. (In fairness, I would like to have a kid through adoption but I don't know if single parents can adopt). Having to live for a job I'll probably hate and now due to the economic crisis that the virus will cause around the world, my plan to study in Spain is likely delayed. I love my teenage years because at least being a top grades kid made my life have a meaning but now, it's sad to see even the kids who were my former bullies improving in their lifes. 

If I hadn't killed myself until now, it's just for my mom and dog. If something where to happen to her, I would likely have no more reasons to live."

I'm sure lots of people feeling this way too."
1,"Progress concerns. I have been in and out of therapy for 3 years but my slow progress with my current T has been discouraging me from coming in because it feels like I’m not getting better. When Im in therapy, It feels so uncomfortable looking at each other when none of us know what to say. My poor memory makes it very difficult to talk about anything. How can I talk about anything when I cant remember anything? Im just forcing things out. This makes me start thinking that Im wasting my time and money which makes me feel guilty about going. I get out what I put in. I write long notes before each session but It dosent always help the conversation going. My low tolerance for frustration, poor motivation, impulsiveness, pettiness, unrealistic expectations and crazy work schedules has made it difficult for me to be in therapy at times.

When I first started I thought that I could just show up and have my therapist make me feel better. I thought that I could quickly get rid of my suicidal thoughts after a few months, recover from withdrawal and never look back on seeing a therapist/pdoc ever again."

I'm just lost. When I think about anything that's due, I just sink lower in my bed. There are plenty of other things I need to do but I just don't think I have the energy anymore.

1,I don’t know how to make friends. I really wish I was better at making friends and being able to keep them as my forever friends I know that sounds really corny but damn I really suck at being friends with people cause I don’t know how to not be anxious and nervous and worried about everything whenever I’m around new people also I hate silence makes me feel so anxious and awkward.. It sucks having no friends when you don’t even have a family either... im basically always alone .. and I always feel empty inside. 😔 I crave real life human interaction but I simply don’t know how to be friends with anyone cause I also have anxiety..

1,"I’ve been having suicidal thoughts all day.... Anyone wouldve thought I was ok, I’ve gotten good at acting like nothing’s wrong. Then out of nowhere I’m just like let’s do it today.

I’ve brought it up to my sister who I’m very close with and she’s very honest with me when she says she doesn’t know how to react to that. But then I’m like well if someone I loved who’s life is seemingly perfect/ normal/good told me they want to die I wouldn’t know how to react either. If I were hearing myself I’d think what more does she want. She has a supportive family, good social life, stable job, nice things, phones cars ,food, roof above her head, not wealthy but also not dirt poor, I have everything and yet I want to die."
1,"Relapsed. I stated cutting again yesterday. I’d stopped for 3 months and then it just happened. It’s like an addiction- if you ever go back to it- you can’t stop again straight away. Yesterday I had 25 cuts, today I had 83. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think, but I’m too scared to admit my issues. Last time my mum saw my cuts, she told me I was stupid. Told me I wasn’t depressed while I cried and screamed. She told me I was only crying because I’d been caught. The only reason she found out is because I told my closest friend- she said I couldn’t keep doing this and told her. She thought she would help me. My mum never does. She threatens to put me in a nutty institute and when she finally promises she’ll take me to a therapist- she never does. I don’t expect her to help anymore. All she did was cause more pain, made it easier for me to self harm and allowed my mental state to deteriorate. I don’t know how much longer I can do this for. There’s one phrase that comes to mind which is, “ I don’t want to live, but I’m too scared to die.”
At this point it’s taboo to use it, but there’s no other words for it. I’m 14 and probably won’t make it to 16"

I have fostered dogs on and off for years and I’ve never had a tough time passing the dog on to it’s new owner. But for some reason this last dog I had was just special. I’ve been caught in the worst depression I’ve ever had in my life and because of quarantine we were able to spend every second together for three weeks. Every day I’d take him to the park and watch him play for a few hours, we’d play together at home and snuggle in my bed. I was always sneaking him bits of my food. He was just such a good dog and I really wanted to adopt him but I can’t because once I go back to work I won’t have the time for him.

I have no one to talk to about this. I can’t form proper thoughts, I feel so consumed by it all. 

I don’t want to feel unwanted or unloved anymore. My body is so trashed from previous attempts and my head just can’t handle this anymore. 

After my dads birthday tomorrow I’ve decided I’m going back to my uni accommodation and I’m going to kill myself. Too many years of not feeling better is too much for anyone"
1,"experiencing intense emotions all day :/. my emotions have been all over the place today. i feel like a fking yoyo. ive literally gone from feeling on top of the world happy to super upset/angry/nervous to laughing to crying to angry again to overwhelmingly lonely... i have an app that tracks emotions on like a graph and there are so many sharp spikes just in the last 24hr period because i try to add stuff every time i feel something or when something happens. the last sort of month tho, the graph looked mostly flat and in the lower third of the graph but today its clearly very different. sure some stuff has happened today but only small events nothing huge that would warrant for intense emotions so its annoying or maybe stupid to be reacting intensely over little things, even when its a positive reaction? i also hurt myself today to uh lol thats another fun thing to add todays list of events. and im literally so tired! its so tiring to go from happy about one event to another situation making you really upset or mad to something else making you feel happy again. im exhausted! and like sure... IM NOT FEELING NUMB TODAY so thats a good thing, right? i shouldn't be complaining about this or even recording its existence because feeling something is better than not right? 
ive been complaining a lot about feeling numb resently and today its almost like ive felt enough intense and extreme emotions for atleast a month. maybe all this time ive felt depressed lonley or numb ive just been saving up all my other emotions just for today.  but it really doesnt feel like a good thing i dont think. sure, good that im not numb and sure ive been happy today but ive also felt really low too. how do i really know how ive felt today when my emotions have been crashing all over the place? i literally cant work out what my average emotion is for today but i can tell you that i am now exhausted. this is all so annoying."
1,"When is suicide ok?. Throughout my struggles with depression I have had issue with the mentality that suicide is never the solution.  I would like to take this chance to voice my opion so I can hear what others think.

By saying suicide is never the solution is to imply that there is no amount of human suffering beyond which continued suffering is less humane than death.  I believe that such a point does exist and once past it suicide should not be discouraged.  Of course while you are suffering it is easy to think you are past that point when you are not so that determination can be quite difficult.  However difficulty of determination does not mean that point doesn't exist.

Anyway, I curious to hear what others think."
1,"many years of youtube. hey. I have been watching youtube a whole lot  
It´s not the only thing I do, but I cannot motivate myself to do anything different while alone, I watch like 15 hours of youtube in a casual day. I´m 20 now ,and have been watching in similar manner since I was ten. I remember my older brother telling me to go and do something else, I did, simetimes, but I have allways returned to youtube as my source of ""fun"". I never talk to anyone, nobody wants to talk to me, nobody really knows how I spend my days, I feel like people dont like me, due to my life on youtube Im pretty akward as i have not expirienced many conversations in my latest life. Saying that, I dont have many friends in my home town, and even whan i meet with some people i find a lack of things to tell them. Are the people my friend when they never seem to want to talk to me? I don´t really know how to meet people, accept trough alcohol and drugs. I also can tell that my personality changes while talking to other people.  
how can I be?"
1,"i shouldn't love you but i couldn't help it. this applies to me a lot, even if i don't realise it, i get attached easily attached to things, people, and ones that don't love me back. in a way i think i even love my depression too because what am i without it? an empty hole of nothingness i guess"
1,"Have you ever felt that some people's lives were predicted to be great but your life not?. I am talking about people that have it all. They are pretty, loved, successful, rich, happy, have a lot of friends and they accomplish everything they think of. Life seems like a walk through a rose garden to them. They enjoy life and want to live forever.

On the other side there are people like me or you. Trying to get through everyday and find motivation to keep up the fight and don't give up. Hoping for a miracle or some kind of change. You find yourself alone every night hoping that tommorw will be different but it isn't. Days, months, years pass by and nothing has changed. You're losing the will to keep fighting and start questioning yourself, life, faith or God if there really isn't even a small piece of happiness for you in this world when there's plenty of happiness for others. You never asked too much from life but even the little you have asked for was not given to you. 
Another day passes by and you try to keep up the fight."

1,"Need for advice. I have a boss who to takes every opportunity to make me look like an incompetent in front of the Partners. I am on my trial period, and I am worried that she might give me a bad review, especially since every company is cutting part of its personnel, do to the COVID-19 crisis.

How should I handle the situation? I am working as hard as humanly possible, and I haven't  confronted her. I have been really polite and warm. I am trying my best not to ""poke the lion"", but I am not able to think straightforward anymore.

Can anybody give me an advice on how to deal with others? This has been a pattern, I have to admit, in previous jobs. However, this time I  am aware of my weaknesses, I am doing therapy to handle my social anxiety, and I am conscious and very careful in every word I say, and everything I do."
1,"No motivation for online school. I've always had trouble getting homework done because of my depression. But with my school switching to online classes I am falling behind even more and I'm just ready to give up at this point.

I can't function in an online learning environment. There is just no way I can retain information like I would in a physical classroom. And I can't bring myself to start on homework until very late when I have to rush to get it done so it isn't turned in late. I waste the rest of my day watching movies, youtube, tv shows, etc. instead because nothing else brings happiness to me anymore besides that. 

I just cannot function without having the routine of waking up, getting ready, and going to school everyday. I would like some advice and want to know if anyone else feels like this. All my teachers are disappointed in me but most don't care about mental health so I can't tell them the truth."
1,"Quarantine depression. I’ve never been truly depressed until now I feel. I’ve had terrible anxiety and consistent derealization for the past 2 years but I cope. But holly this quarantine is hitting a new lever of depression. It takes me hours to get out of bed. When I do I just feel like breaking down. My girlfriend who is everything to me is going through the same thing but much much worse and I’m always worried about her. She calls me because I’m the only one who genuinely helps. Now in her defence, she is literally amazing. She cares about me so much and doesn’t just shove her problems onto me she goes slow with her issues and only talks about it when she really needs to. Anyway but now her parents forced her to take a night shift at a paper rout job from 1:00 to 5:00 am. I’ll barely be able to talk to her and her being what helps me and me being what helps her isn’t going to end well. I’m very much ranting right now and completely lost my train of thought but holy shit this quarantine is not going well."

We are only allowed to head out to get essential items and have to be home all the way. 

or if you are an essential worker. 

i am tasked to head back to work every two days once, which very tiring to be honest the days i am not allowed back to work, i have to work from home. 

on top of that, I HATE STAYING AT HOME. I simply hate it. It makes my thoughts worst. 

i am never happy at home... even though home is supposed to be the happiest place in the world.

I have bought up to 40 random games on steam which all of which i can only play for an hour. 

Otherwise, I get annoyed and my thoughts run amuck. I have tried everything i could from netflix to weird online courses. 

At least i get to head back to work every two days once.

Anyways, I have fibro and am in  pain constantly. I submitted an accommodation request and had my dr sign off on it for a minor part of the job. They ended up denying it because I wasn't technical enough. I was feeling depressed enough working there already, but this really adds on to it.

For those of you who don't have fibro, the cold is excruciating and I'm more prone to injuries in the cold.

I haven't been back for a month and I'm finally going back today, but I'm scared. I've been crying about it all morning and I'd rather do anything than go back to that hellscape. The thought just fills me with so much despair. I've been in a depressive funk already bc of the covid crisis, so it's all piling on.

Just thinking of stepping through those barred, rotating doors makes me want to die. It all just fills me with so much dread."
1,"online courses + returning to a toxic home environment are making me intensely suicidal. I have no motivation to get any work done, I'm finishing my junior year of college and I want to finalize this semester strong as I'm a straight A student, but I am so depressed being trapped home due to COVID-19 ever since my college closed down to remote classes for the semester. I have never been so depressed where I am sitting unable to focus or do anything for days, I just sit in my room and try to study and work, but I space out not even procrastinating truly just doing nothing. And all I feel is even more guilty because I feel like I am letting my professors and myself down by being unable to do my work. I feel myself loosing track of contacting my best friend from school, and I feel like I'm becoming fully isolated at home, which in itself is already difficult given the circumstances. Now I'm back in my toxic home environment having to deal with a past abuser who I cannot communicate with. I went a month walking on eggshells before anything became instigated between us in an interaction, but today I finally snapped and broke down. Now I can't even leave my room to go to the kitchen or anything and I've been trying to force myself to sit and work and all I want to do is die.

I've never really been at this intense of a low before where I'm spending days on end starring at a wall or zoning out and disassociating all day. I feel suicidal, and now with all that's happening in the world the short and long term future goals that were propelling me forward through my bad days don't exist because it's all unknown. On top of all this, I've been having extremely vivid nightmares which hasn't really been something I've experienced a lot before nearly every night I guess because I'm in this perpetual state of anxiety and stress. I feel like I can't  just have a single moment of peace to breathe and not feel like absolute shit."
1,"Not sure how to help girlfriend. To make a long story short we’ve been together for a little more than a year now and I love her to death. Whenever we’re together it’s been nothing but a good time filled with laughs and lots of food (lol).

Recently I noticed she’s been irritated with me and she said that she started to relate signs of depression to things she was feeling like feeling irritated easily, anger, self-loathing etc. also she would have the extreme thoughts of self-harm but she would never act on it. I tried to comfort her saying that I will be there for her and all that but that response turned around on me because I constantly tel her that. She wants a different response like how to comfort her or help her but I am at a lost for words and don’t know what to say. 

I love her and I can see us being together for a while and I really hope this is one of those challenges that we just face and get over.

Any help is appreciate thanks guys."

I would love nothing else to drinking myself to death. I am pretty sure I have been close as I drank a whole bottle of whiskey and a whole bottle of vodka in less than 15 minutes and spent the whole night throwing up bile. I am just so done with life in every aspect and I guess this is just my way of venting. I am sorry to disturb yall. Peace.
1,"I hate my life. I’m fat. I’m worthless. And I’m a loser. My brother even says that my mom thinks I’m obese. He told me they might have to put me on fasting. I don’t even eat that bad. It’s just that it’s so hard to workout during quarantine. My family’s gym is closed so I can’t do a class there. And the zoom classes are always when I do school. My family always wants me to do stuff around the house and whenever I try to do something I usually get yelled at because of some little mistake. My brothers hate me. I’m failing science (a C is considered a fail in my house My brother and I have to have at least all B’s).  I’m sick of quarantine. I just want it all to end. I have had thoughts about how I’m better off dead but then I’m all like “I can’t die yet, we have t gotten a sonic adventure remake.” But even then that’s not enough. Whenever I get depressed around my family my dad just tells me to stop being a bitch. And then they all laugh at me. I know he’s probably right on how I’m such a sensitive bitch. My only ways to escape from it all is watching tv, going on Reddit, and drawing. I would say talking it out with my cat by my brother is usually in my room and he would just think I’m insane. Whenever I’m around people I decide to just put on a happy face and hide the pain. Whenever something humiliating or something regarding hate for me goes on I just write down negative things on a piece of paper. I don’t know how many times I’ve wanted to kill myself."
1,"I’m losing patience with my mother.. My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”"
1,"How can I tell my mom I don't believe in God?. I'm a 16-year-old guy from South America. My family have been Christians for their whole lives, and I had been too, until around 3 years ago.  I don't know why I started doubting my faith, but the fact is I don't believe in God anymore.  For 3 years I've been acting as if I did believe, and even if tedious, it hasn't been that difficult. Before proceeding, I need to say I've been suffering from depression and other issues. In the last year and a half approximately, I've been just getting worse and worse. I told my parents and they took me to a therapist ( thankfully), but my mom says that the efforts of anyone to help are futile without the help of God. I think I could go through with this and continue lying, but I also think I need to say the truth to her. Luckily, my mom and my dad have been trying to help me with my mood, and I really don't want to cause them more trouble. That's the thing; I feel like I'm tearing my family apart ( my mom has even said that because of me she wished she didn't live here, she's not to be blamed for that, though), and I don't want to cause them more trouble. Like faithful Christians, my parents' lives revolve around God ( especially my mom's). I'm really scared of messing this up and ruining everything. Any help will be appreciated."
1,"Casual.. For me, depression’s become such a passive thing. 

If my mind is a house, then depression is like some gloomy yet almost harmless homeless guy sitting on the front porch smoking a cigarette. He tells me a stoic “Hello” when I wake up, and again at night. Sometimes he’ll bring up memories I have of people I loved that are gone now, but reliving those moments in my head actually make me happy for a moment. I thank him for these and go about my way. 

I could be angry at him but I feel like I moved him in here myself, with my choices."
1,"Woke up this morning in a pretty major depressive rut.. Most days, if not every, I feel some semblance of my depression. I’m constantly fighting to live, forcing myself to act, to move, to be. The sadness buries itself beneath a layer of confused muddled mush of feelings. And sometime, rarely, I cry. Like after listening to a song or watching something. But on the day to day, my feelings consist of dried out excuses for what could be real. I can’t lie though, I do feel joy. I feel joy more than I am able to cry in fact. But the joy is just in the moments, fairly short lasting, and soon to be covered by the muddle of confusion which is my usual state. Every now and then, maybe two days - to one week a month, maybe twice a month, I don’t keep track, I get worse. I go into deep depressions. Days where I can’t force myself up. Days where my thoughts are haunted by negativity and where those feelings of muddled confusion manifest in self hate, these are the days like today. I always forget they come. And now I’m here, in quarantine. With plenty to do, read, play piano, exercise, do school work, draw, write, watch tv, endless. Time, all I have is time. But the only thing that’s calling my name is my bed. The only thing I ever want to do is sleep. And now that my thoughts have been cursed with these negative ones, thoughts of suicide and worthlessness -thoughts that always pass eventually, I’ve got the best excuse in the world to just fuck off and lay in bed, right?"

1,"I’ve just stopped talking to people about it, it’s given me a lot less stress.. I’ve been depressed for most of my life, I used to constantly talk to my friends about my issues. But recently I’ve learned that nobody actually cares, and no advice ever helps. Opening up about it doesn’t make me feel better, it makes me feel stupid. I just feel stupid and weak for being like this, so since it has no point I’ve just stopped talking about it. And on the flip side they stopped asking how I’ve been. I’ve got a few “glad you’ve cheered up a little bit” and “good to see you’re good” and such. I’m not actually better, I haven’t been this bad in a while. Been going through a rough period for a few months now. Ending it’s not an optional, and I hope I can improve my situation after all this virus stuff passes. But it’s just a pointless hope, my life’s not getting any better. I’m still gonna be the same fat loser until I die alone in my 30’s. But hey at least I don’t gotta deal with the constant bullshit from people who don’t actually give a shit about Me. And I don’t have to do the stupid song and dance of being vulnerable and accepting shitty advice from people. Now I can just bottle it all up in silence and not have to deal with others “worrying” about me."

1,This pandemic makes me want to kill myself. I mean it when I say it it makes me want to end my life. It makes me feel like life has no meaning anyway and I really can't find any reason to live at all. Why even get out of bed? Every day is the same. Im losing it. I know Im not being rational but I cant help it. I cry everyday. My mom is out of work we barely have money to eat. I just can't see any way I will ever get out of this situation. I guess it's a dead end for me guys.
1,"This year.... It was going to be one of the greatest years of my life. 2019 had been one of the worst years I've ever been through. Depression, suicidal thought (almost daily), strained relationship with my father, the death of my dog (who's saved me from ending it earlier in my life), my ""best friend"" consistently being a dick to me throughout the entire year, etc. etc. etc.

Somehow, in january this year, something snapped in me. I was going to turn 2020 into the best year of my life. I started eating better and exercising more, already lost nearly 17 kg so far, I started practising my social skills more, I made sure I got a promotion at work. But then, it all got turned upside down in a heartbeat.

This Corona pandemic has ruined everything. My biggest hobby, which is going to concerts, has now been taken away from me, paranoia within my family has risen to a point where the toxicity levels are at an all time high and now my grandmother, who is one of the only people I've ever felt close with, is in the hospital. Suffering from Corona with a very slim chance of survival.

The one time in my life where I actually got motivated, started bettering myself and was going to make my way out of depression and anxiety so that in the future, I wouldn't have to go through my entire life alone anymore, I could maybe get in a relationship without messing it up due to anxiety and make some connections with people. The one time I started getting a little better everything turned to shit. Just like it always seems to do. Now I've slid back into a depression that's possibly worse than ever before. It's like I've been destined to be taken down to the ground on every step my entire life. I know there's way bigger problems going on in the world right now, but this is just how I feel right now.

I hope this year is over quick, because I will make it through. I owe it to my dog and my grandma."

I am always alone.. I never get asked to go anywhere.. no one thinks of me.. I always spend my birthdays alone.. holidays are depressing.. etc. this pandemic isn’t helping me feel any better but it isn’t like I was even doing anything with my life before this ..

On the outside people think I have it good, because I have a wife, 2 kids, a house and a reasonable low end job, but I go through periods of feeling really down. Like a lot of people due to the virus I've been furloughed since the lock down and don't know if I'll have a job to go back to after the lock down is lifted. It's stressing me out. 

I've been in the house for 3 weeks just me and kids because my wife is a key worker. Now, I love my kids but I am not the stay at home type. I've always been the strict parent with a short fuse and my patience has been worn away to nothing. I find myself shouting at my kids and wife. I hate it. It makes me feel worthless that I can't even be nice to my family.

I grew up with a family that has strict ideas of what a man should do and be so I've never really able to manage my emotions. I just stuffed them down until they burst over. I struggle to talk to people even at the best of times, never at the worst. 

I know this is a bit of a ramble and I apologise but can anyone suggest anything to help everything stop weighing so much? I need to drag myself up because this can't go on."

Due to corona I'm currently on a break from therapy for depression, anxiety and BPD. I live alone, am alone at home 24/7 not doing anything all day. On Friday I made my only friend escape from our friendship. Since then no contact. I hit rock bottom and can't escape. The last days I spent crying and grieving for this friend. Hoping they would return. I kept reading posts that support my point of view, the Borderliner point of view. My emotions were mainly sadness, emptiness, yearning, grieving, hopelessness etc. Today random posts of other people showing the other point of view, my friends point of view, popped up. I lost myself in them. I read through all of them. ""I cut off a toxic friend and never felt more alive"" and similar posts. It triggered my anger. My anger and hate towards myself, until i lost it. I released it. Now the anger is gone and I'm back to everything I felt before."
1,I Lost my dearest cat. Just last night. In a horrible way and didn’t get to say goodbye. He was my everything. I have nothing more to live for
1,"I almost fked up or did I?. So little bit of context: my grandparents come from a small mountain village where the head of the family decides everything. That behavior continues even now in Belgium. Now my mom who cares for my grandparents is always mad and takes it out on me...

Story: me and sister(sis)

Me: I going crazy from grandparents shouting 
Sis: just keep calm and help mom with dishes and chores.
Me: no why would I she's always mad and ungrateful.
Sis: well maybe you should wake up earlier that would help

(I almost sent) 
Me: honestly I don't know whether I even want to wake up.)"
1,I think I get worse everyday. Today I woke up and felt a bit better. I didnt feel depressed much but after a few hours I feel like I want to die again :/ ( Was like this before the virus)
1,"So many people are dying because of COVID 19 and many of them don't even deserve it.. Why the fuck not me? Come right at me, bro!"

1,"I've Compromised Myself. So I have been talking to this girl (im a guy) from a subreddit for making new friends since february. At first we were just friendly, wed talk about anything and everything. There was a girl i liked at work and since i didnt really have any close female friends at the time there was no one to ask for advice/talk about it with. So i talked about it with this girl. But then this girl got back with her ex, which i kinda saw coming. But especially since quarantine me and this reddit girl have talked a lot. I hypothetically asked her out to which she said yeah. And so i confirmed that if i actually came to hers after quarantine and asked her out she would say yes, and she said yes. So theres that. 

Since then we been talking about everything and more. The last week we've been calling each other and sending each other nudes. Which we would joke about a few weeks back. Like id say 'send nudes' and shed say 'bet', then id say 'jkes' and then 'unless u wanna'. Basically i have fallen for this girl hard we've even been on dates in games. Ive tried to figure out if shes serious, like am i just being played. But everything seems to check out. Like she sent nudes and stuff and we call. But yet i cant help but feel like it could still be a massive troll. Like she knows im not talking to anyone else and stuff as she would say 'i dont have side hoes', she says she doesnt and i 98% believe her. But obviously until we meet there is gonna be doubt. But it could literally be months before we get to meet. Im treading on dangerous water. Because if this is not all it seems to be im gonna have a big fuckin problem so i hope to fuckin god this is real."
1,"I hate looking on Facebook. (I'm 23) There's constantly people who have graduated college and are doing something with their lives while I'm stuck here being lazy, pathetic, and have no idea what to do with mine. Only thing I was ever good at is typing and rapping but those don't seem to get me anywhere and I'm too stupid to do anything else. I literally forget my own friend's names sometimes, it's pathetic. Going on Facebook just makes me even feeling okay to being depressed. Not to mention, being a disappointment to my parents is probably the worse part. Other parents are proud of their kids. Some of my high school friends are even getting married. It's a terrifying feeling knowing that time will probably keep slipping me by."
1,My mom ruins my mood. Today I woke up ready to take care of myself I washed all my clothes getting ready for my interview tomorrow and my mood was somewhat good. Then my mom yells my name and she goes of ranting to me about how I’m ungrateful and how I look high and how I’m fake. I’m tired of hearing this shit. I don’t hate my mom but it puts me in a bad mood
1,"anybody else annoyed by the phrase “it gets better”?. it can’t be just me. i come to this sub for moral support when i’m really struggling and i need to relate to somebody, i don’t need to see “it’ll get better!! stay alive!! talk to a professional! CaLL tHe SuIcIdE hOtLiNe!!” 

fuck you. i don’t wanna hear it. i love seeing recovery stories, but i don’t like it when the person telling the story starts trying to give us a pep talk. and i ESPECIALLY don’t wanna hear it from a neurotypical when i’m sobbing at four am and trying to stop thinking about my x-acto."
1,"Opinions/guidance needed. I'll just jump right into it.

My family wants to know my drugs history. Should I tell them? 

I asked for assistance long ago to help with my depression from all my family. The first thing they asked was what's ""mind altering"" drugs have I taken.
I said nothing believing that drugs isn't what caused my depression, but in fact my family. This is when my anxiety went through the roof. I just wanted to tell them it's their fault. 

Now after the long period of time of receiving no help I just want to text my family the list of drugs and then see what they do.

Is this the reason they have been so useless in dealing with my depression. Is it worth the shit storm that will follow?"
1,"Plan A - Let's go out spreading good. I've been hanging around this r/ for quite awhile. 

Today is a turning point, where I've lost the majority of my hope. It is now time to plan my next steps seriously. I pos this on the off chance my plan can provide someone guidance on the next steps of their life. And perhaps as an immutable record on the www. Maybe I am crying out to the world? Who knows?

I've been fighting to repair things with my wife for months after another traumatic event, the passing of my mum. In a short span I've lost my wife, my mum, my home, my future, my dreams and soon my childhood home as my dad sells the place.

I've done things wrong by my wife and was too ignorant and self absorbed to realise the signs. Even when she clearly pointed it out to me. I recognise its my fault now; I was too focused on what I thought she wanted and not what she told me she needed, and too lazy and dumb to carefully ponder her words. The best I can do now is to ensure that when I leave she is well cared for financially and that I've done all the things I've said I would to make her home perfect.

After this I will give away the majority of my things; there is no meaning to collecting things without having a home to store them or someone to share them with. Years of work and money wasted hoarding things for a future that will never see the light of day. Alas, fate and hindsight be a fickle beast.

Finally I will leave and volunteer in an impoverished nation to give someone a chance as happiness as penance for destroying my wife's happiness. Maybe I will die here from crime or illness. But at least I will have made a positive impact on someone. Who knows I might feel like I deserve happiness again.

What I will not do is leave without giving back to the world and balancing the scales. There is too much sadness in the world as it is. I have no hope for heaven but maybe this will absolve some of my sins.

I know this is selfish to my family, but my sis has her partner and my dad will have my sister. Sometimes we have to do what will bring us peace be it momentary or eternal.

I hope someone else find solace in the below excerpt of Dylan Thomas's famous poetry. The complete poetry isn't relevant to me but certain sections call out to my situation. It has given me and continues to give me strength in times of weakness, fighting for the courage to do good and remain hopeful as oppose to acting on my sucidal ideation.

""Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."""
1,"I think I’m getting suicidal again, maybe I just need some sleep. I turned on the stove after leaving some chemicals on it and the bottle next to it, just hoping it’d blow up or burn my face off. I don’t know. It was idiotic but the impulse just happened. I think if I go up the stairs to sleep I might look back and try to throw myself down the stairs. At least I put all the knives away. I’m tired"
1,"I just wanna kill myself and quarantine makes my situation worse. Hello, I have already tried a lot to find help but either people don't understand me or he doesn't seem to care.  I isolate myself because I feel like a burden.  No one really likes me because if I don't talk to them, they won't talk to me.  But sometimes I feel lonely but really and I start to have paranoid delusions in these situations.  I have never seen a psychologist.  I am a lost cause and no one is concerned about my mental health or how I am going.As soon as I seek help I feel worse.  Like I want to live like this all my life.  When I'm in the mood I feel bad because I didn't get used to it.  My friends must have hurt with this.  There are those who keep telling me that I have several personalities (I don'tthink so), but then on this kind of thing I think about it all night.  Or some people tell me that I am too skinny.  I don't understand why people care so much about people's bodies but not about their problems.  I'm fed up. So I would like to leave to stop living in all this suffering, so that people can notice that I existed."
1,"Everything was going great and then it went downward spiral. I don't know what to do and it's too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he's moving and we might not see each other again. 

&#x200B;

Background of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he's been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can't really think of anything else right now, I'm too sad about it).

&#x200B;

I don't know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I don't know what else.."
1,"A bright personality and a sad soul stuck in the same body is torture sometimes.. I often been told that I have a good heart or that I am a good person but I often feel like it isn't true. Yea I do alot of things to help people but I often feel like I am alone in the world. I been told why not get myself someone, I would often reply saying that I am not worth someone having. I been told to get over past traumas, I would reply that I try too but somethings never changes.

Moral of the story is, I have what I need to be happy, yet I just feel utterally and totally useless and void of happiness.

I became addicted to escapism to the point where the very concept of video games are being burnt out for me. Art is starting to not be fun for me, making music is starting to not be fun for me. Everything that I used to do for fun is being burnt out.

Then there is the question of ""why not look for someone"". Simple answer, I am too mentally unstable for a relationship. It would take the worlds most patience person to understand and help me work through my problems without it affecting them. Plus I am terrible with people. 

When I was asked by I joined a league discord and joined a team and stuff, all I could say was. Because I was lonely. Not having people who wants to talk to you, or actually gives a shit about me for so long causes me to just be lonely.

The only thing in the world I want or per-say NEED in my life, are people who gives a shit and understands me as a person."
1,"The only reason im alive is because i dont wanna hurt my friends. I'm 15 and i have it fairly good, upper middle class family, considered to be ""popular"" school, do well acedemically but I'm still so fuckin depressed. when people ask me how im doing i can't tell them im doing shitty because i don't a reason to be doing shitty so i always just tell them that I'm doing fine. about a 2 months ago i was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and put on antidepressants but they dont help i still hate myself and life. really the only people that are there for me are my close friends and if I'm honest their the only reason im alive. I've started drinking/smoking/vaping/drugs to try and numb the pain cus i promised them i wouldn't hurt myself anymore. its jus like every fuckin day i reach my breaking point. ive tried to find healthier ways to cope but nothing numbs it like getting high. i jus found this sub and idk why but i thought maybe itd help to make a post, sorry for the wall of text to anyone that reads this."
1,Nobody to talk to.. I have so much bottled up from over the years and it's just getting worse every day. I have nobody to talk to. All my friends gave up on me at this point because I avoided everyone for so long. If i were to try talking to anybody about my feelings it would just be a burden on them. The only way I can let anything out is here anonymously. I just need someone to tell me that it will be okay..
1,"How can you focus on reading when you are distracted?. I do not know if I suffer from depression now, but I have previously been diagnosed, and I find it very difficult to just sit down and read a book. It's partly because of the silence: I don't want to feel alone and with my own thoughts and so I prefer to sit on my laptop with videos of others or with music. I'd like to get through some books I've been meaning to read for a long time now that I have a little bit of extra time, but I just can't make myself focus. I can't get beyond a couple of pages before getting up and doing something else. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone found any tricks to help them focus?"

1,"Covid-19 Pandemic anxieties. Hello, 

I have never really been the type to be Depressed, I have always been a very optimistic and confident  guy. As of late with this whole Coronavirus pandemic i have been feeling the loss of interest in participating in society and maybe even being alive. This really spans from me being a classified an essential employee at a t-mobile store. I am thankful to be able to have a job because I know it is much better than not having one and I personally am taking the right precautions to stay safe.

However since my store reopened, most of the types of customers i have been seeing are people breaking quarantine because the are simply bored and want to be out and about. the question we get the most is  ""what kinds of deals do you guys have?"" 

This infuriates me because someone can just as easily look this up online without putting themselves or my co workers and I in danger. and for as long as there are people like that i dont see the situation getting any better.

I have also seen the better air quality and have read articles here and there about the atmosphere actually healing from the reduction of human activity.

Maybe humans are parasites despite our perceptions of ourselves. We are the only species that take and never give. we are literal maggots to this rotting earth. the more turmoil we go though, the less will i have to live. i feel like there is no point to anything at all. and i have never felt as suicidal as i do in these times"
1,"I just simply cant win.... its like swiming in the sea trying to go out but just go deeper and further from the coast, and everybody talks you like you were shit because you cant swim and get to the coast, i supouse that one day of this i just will get the strong will on my mind to just end this, but at the moment, i ll continue swiming in this sea."
1,"Well, I'm done. I tried to change, but my body refuses to.. Hello again, this is deleted user StupidDumbFuckhead here. Around a week ago, I made a post on how I wanted to delete my memories and stuff because my life was cringe, and every action I make, I think it's cringe. I'm a gamer, but I restart video games often. I don't like the save files there. Even if I restart, I think it's still cringy, and I want to restart again! Plus, I have OCD hand washing problems. And I am autistic, so some of this may be dramatic. And I think that deleting my memories would be the perfect way to cure this ""mini-depression"" before it gets worse.

While I was a happy ""child"", and now in my teenage years, I'm a bit depressed, it might just get worse. I have a terrible attitude, and I've been trying to ""change"" it since July 2017, but it keeps getting worse. And with this STUPID COVID-19 existing, forcing me to use the confusing program known as ""Microsoft Teams"" instead of just going to my Special Needs class at my High School, I keep missing stuff, since I don't use my iPad that my schoolwork is on every day. And I could change that. But I won't.

And now, my stupid mother decided that I should ""heal my hands"", so she got rid of my soap and water. They may look terrible, but I'm gonna fucking die now. She doesn't know about how big this mistake is. And I could had avoided all of this bullshit this morning! But I didn't. Instead, I was stupid. I woke my mom up instead of using the other soap. I am so fucking useless. Now I have to limit my bathroom uses, because of her. You see, I had pee problems since I was 7. And no matter how many squares of Toilet Paper I use, pee goes on my hands just from WIPING it. My mom thinks I piss myself, when in reality, I don't. Pee just goes on my hands from wiping it. And I can't wash my hands off. So now my hands have to be dirty, and they'll smell like shit as well. All because of my fucking mother. I fucking hate her.

But, if I delete my memories, then I won't have to deal with any of this! Then I won't restart my games, and think it's ""Cringe"" when I first start them, since I won't remember playing them again! Then I won't know everything I touch will smell like shit since I won't be smelling my hands one-thousand fucking times in a few seconds. Then I'll be even more stupid as fuck, so then I can become smarter! Then, my body won't be stupid as well, and maybe it could reconnect to my brain again! AND THEN MAYBE I'LL FINALLY STOP MAKING CRINGY CHOICES, GET RID OF THIS DEPRESSION BEFORE IT STARTS, AND FINALLY BE A FUCKING GENIUS LIKE I WAS MENT TO BE! I HAD ENOUGH OF MY FUCKING LIFE! I NEED WAYS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MY MEMORIES RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

IF YOU TELL ME TO CHANGE, I WILL JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE, SINCE I'M A FUCKING STUPID CUNT WHO NEEDS HER MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE!

I AM FUCKING LOSING MY SANITY AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE!

I JUST WANT MY MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE AND PERISH FOREVER IN AN ABYSS THAT WILL SOON BE ERASED!

I WANNA BE FUCKING MINDLESS!

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-"
1,"Coping/managing between therapy sessions. During and right after a therapy session, I feel connected to my therapist and positive about my CBT exercises for the week.

As the week goes by and my next session approaches, I feel more and more pessimistic about my therapy regime, struggle to do my CBT exercises and feel like I haven't spoken to my therapist in months...

Does anyone else struggle with this or has anyone stopped going to therapy because of it? How do you deal with it?"
1,"Life's falling apart. I've recently lost my job, I tell people it was because they had run out of work. When really it was because I was a shit worker, not because I refused to do the work. But I've never been a fast learner and have always found the hardest way to do things. Now I'm applying for jobs but can't shake this massive feeling of anxiety that it will turn out the same. Unable to learn and do anything without having someone hold my hand the whole time.

Ive lost my license, and my partner doesn't have one so I was the only way for her to get to work so she could earn money to support us both.

I have bills out my ass. 

No sense of direction and purpose in life, and having no idea what to do genuinely fucking sucks. I honestly do not know what to do, everyone around me knows what they're doing and where they're going. 

I have always felt as if the whole universe is against me,  everything bad that could happen to me always seems to happen at once. It's the most unfair feeling in the world. 

I know I may come across as a sad sac of shit who's too lazy to go out and try new things, but I know I'm not."

I constantly think I would be better of dead, I’m crying every few days, I have random panic attacks and am just overall sad and have little hope, low motivation, mental break downs sometimes suicidal thoughts. I’ve never felt any of these go away with any type of medication I’ve tried. What is supposed to happen? Am I expecting too much?"

Creative things are my default. But when I try different ones, they all feel equally unappealing.

So how do you tell whats worth pursuing?

(It doesn't help that I'm shit at them. I feel embarrassed because everyone I know doing similar things started 5+ years ago, and isn't shit at them. If I try to have a conversation about it, I’m gonna sound like an idiot. Half of my motivation is to have something to talk about so I don't seem so boring. So it feels pretty pointless.

I've been told by therapists to think about what I liked as a kid 'before' I was depressed, but that's obviously a dead end.

I know I like cooking. But there's only so much cooking I can (afford to) do in a day. None of the things I try feel anywhere near as satisfying. But even my interest in that has gone down recently.)"
1,"I was happy with the birthday messages I got from my internship “friends” until another girl’s birthday came up today and made me realize no one there thinks of me as a friend lmao. I’ve made zero friends in college and I honestly from the bottom of my heart believed that my internship colleagues were my friends. I opened up so much to them, did the absolute most to overcome my anxiety and approach them first, and I thought they enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed theirs. 


On my birthday I got some “happy birthday xoxo” and was over the moon and felt good, so life was like WELL. I THINK THE FUCK NOT. 


Today is this girl’s birthday. She’s been in this internship for FOUR MONTHS. I’ve been in it FOR OVER A FUCKING YEAR. Everyone sent her HUGE ass messages, like “i love you so much you’re so lovely i miss you we’re so lucky to work with you” “you’re such a nice and beautiful person inside and outside, I wish you the best, let’s hang out soon” and ooooh boy, what a reality check"

And sometimes, I cant motivate myself to go out in the garden for 5 minutes.

1,"3 years of heartbreak. Listen ladies and gentleman I need some people to talk to. I’m not going to go into great detail but I have been completely in love with this girl for probably the past 4 years but 3 years seriously. There are so so many intricacies right the story but let’s just say I’ve spent days upon days in time ruminating of being with her of our memories and our future and how I was the Happiest and most driven I’ve ever been with her. I’m a pretty emotional guy I guess but the amount of nights of sleep I’ve lost over this girl is astronomical, I’ve gone for runs at midnight bawling my eyes out just and bawled my eyes out so so many times. 

I’m a good looking guy in very good shape (not bragging) and I like to think I am a very good person but anyways I cannot live anyone and I also don’t know how to put myself out there as I’m not super social to strangers and I put myself into introversion more often than not even though I have good social skills. She is dating my friend and has been for about a year and anyways I have times where I forget she exists but then I see her friend or her name somewhere and I’m put into a heart wrenching “depression” I guess and I don’t know what the fuck to do, all my dreams and goals seem pointless if I can’t share them with her. I can still remember vividly her telling me she didn’t love me like I loved her and processing to throw up in the toilet instantly after no joke. I can’t do this anymore people I can’t"
1,"Tried writing something to distract myself. So you think this was one big step. 
No, nothing is. 
In this case, I feel 
the steps under consideration were similar to those taken by tiny baby feet. 
You think one considers taking such a decision because they want it. 
No, it is the society which rather encourages one to do the act. 
It is just a method of relieving oneself of the pain. 
No, it's not a shortcut.
 It is truly one of the most difficult tasks. 
Those who contemplate on performing it seldom do so. 
For there is this terifying fear of failure 
(and the accompanying shame and mockery). No, one should not eye the victim with contempt but with compassion. 
Instead of acting in the typical 'holier than thou' attitude 
try to take a few steps 
in the shoes of the person you were trying so hard to tarnish the reputation of. 
No, Don't you say that it is an act of seeking attention. 
For a change, think of how hard you were on the person. 
No, the reason isn't silly. No reason is.
It is your mentality that is worthy of the said adjective.

1,"I'm still alive. Well, here I am.

  I don't know where to begin. Life has been pretty rough lately, it has been for everyone. I've been working as much as possible so I don't lose my mind with everything that has happened within the past two months. The best conclusion I can currently come up with to make myself feel better is plan for the future. We hope (my household), with our stimulus checks, we can move out of the motel we're currently living in. Since I am also still working and receiving a paycheck, I intend to use this money towards fixing my teeth and getting a phone. I intend to help my best friend get her license and a car in the both of our names. Eventually, we're going to move out of state together. We can't figure out where yet, but that doesn't matter. We're making goals and we're planning and we're working and waiting. That's all we can do, right now.

 On a sadder note, I'm learning to not cry as often. Which doesn't sound sadder, by any means. But I kind of feel like it could be. Numb has always been worse because it just makes the days go faster, it doesn't take away that looming sense of doom in the back of my head. Or take your face away when I close my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I know I'll be okay. I just need to listen to 'I see a light' by Hank Williams on repeat and keep reminding myself what I need to do. If the harsh things I've been through have taught me anything, it's to learn to love and let go. And the best way I know how right now, is to just hope that someday, you'll be proud of me. That also keeps me going a little bit. That's what helps me accept what has happened. Instead of convincing myself I'm horrible and letting myself rot in my own little shell like I have so many times in the past before, once I started to, it woke me up. I saw myself in the mirror last week and I hated what I saw. So, if anything, You'll be proud of me someday, just like I'll be."
1,"Haven't slept right in a week. As the title says. Just venting here. I have some honestly incredible friends who I can normally talk this through with, but the stars are aligning in all the worst ways and they're all in terrible places, going through much worse shit than me at the moment. Last thing they need to hear is someone else's negativity right now. 

To keep it simple, for the last eight nights, I've been having panic attacks whenever I settle for bed and then nightmares. It's literally come out of nowhere. I'm no stranger to panic attacks, but I usually only get them in social situations, and nightmares haven't really bothered me much before. I haven't been able to sleep any more than three or fours hours each night, and on two nights, I've just given up and spent time on my computer mid-morning. 

I think it's just lots of little anxieties and worries building up, but the suddenness of it's floored me. I honestly don't know what to do. Been in touch with a doc about it via text (my university medical centre) and all I got back was a link to an online resource about improving your sleep hygiene. I guess the quarantine situation means I can't reasonably expect much on that front, which I understand and respect, but it still feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth. Country's facing some nightmarish shit at the moment but having no medical guidance for it doesn't put any smiles on my face.

I'm trying not to fall into a self-pity hole, but I was honestly not doing *too* bad until I woke up today. I was feeling shit all week, but rolling out of bed and socialising at least one friend each day to keep myself distracted. Today, I immediately just felt like a lemming as I opened my eyes, like I want to just go hurl myself off a bridge. I've got friends in a Discord call right now who I could go join, but I feel so groggy and snappy that socialising is starting to feel like a worse and worse idea the more I think about it.

I know it's just my brain being an utter dick to me plus my body crashing hard from the bad sleep, but I feel really stuck in this slump because of that. Any tips or advice you guys have would be appreciated. Thanks for reading, hope you're all holding up okay and staying safe with the world being as crazy as it is right now."
1,"I’m surrounded by family yet I’ve never felt so lonely and isolated.. This quarantine is my own personal hell. For the past two years I basically shut myself away with my ex and some of the stuff we went through sucked but she made it all worth it. Then right before covid struck she completely ghosted me and ran off to Omaha with some dude and called me a liar, manipulator, and said I held her back the entire time. My brother that I trusted with literally anything completely agreed with her on everything even though he saw the way I worshipped the ground she walked on. He’s apologized but it’ll never be the same, he keeps trying to respark what we had before and it isn’t there. Because of this I had to move back in with my grandparents and I love them so much but their health is failing both physically and mentally and it’s really hard not to completely shatter and fall apart. I can’t go out and meet some new people with this, all I can do is watch what family I have left wither away slowly and it’s killing me. The girl I loved so much walked away, my brother I thought I could trust with my life backstabbed me, and my reward is watching my remaining relatives waste away in a chair talking incoherently what they saw on fb. It’s so hard to keep moving on through these ashes."
1,"I need help to stop cutting. I (15f) really need help. It's something I've been doing more and more over the past month or so, and I really need help to stop. Whenever I do it, I almost immediately reach out to my girlfriend (16f) and feel absolutely horrible, but it's what I deserve, so I keep doing it. I'd keep doing it, but she blames herself, and I can't let her do that. I'm hurting her, and she's the only thing keeping me going. I need to stop for her, because she has a history of self harm, has over 10 suicide attempts, and I'm afraid she'll fall back into that if I can't stop. 

Please help me. I can't keep hurting her like this"
1,"Tiredness and Depressive thoughts. Hey everyone,  does anyone find that their mod is massively dictated by their energy levels? Like if you get bad sleep you have much stronger depressive thoughts?"
1,"I feel empty. The smallest things put me down. I feel like I die a little inside every day. I dont see the point in trying anymore. The only reason in still here is because its too difficult to not. 

Sometimes, I wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up. I would be happier there than in my real life. But I'm just a spoiled piece of shit. I have so much in my life that others only dream of, but it isnt enough for me. I am really a terrible person. Sure I dont go around trying to hurt people, but I'm just innately flawed. 

I feel like I take more from those around me than I give back. I constantly feel insecure. Am I a good person? Do people hate me? Am I just a burden? Am I a selfish shit of a person?

There's something wrong with me. I dont know anything. I have no ambition. I have no desire. I just want to play games all day.

I can't do anything correct. Its never enough. Its never good. I am never good. I am wrong.

I dont know what to do. I am overwhelmed. I just want it all to stop. I just want to be happy. Please."
1,"I cried and I do not think I deserved to do it. My father is emotionless and I inherited this from him. I always had problems with showing emotions especially sorrow. I can't cry. I cried during movie like twice in my entire life and one while playing videogame. I am feeling depressed often but I never talked about it because I always thought that I do not have right to be sad. I met some bad people when I was young and also my family kept me isolated so I developed social anxiety even tho I am extrovert. 

Last year I started trusting people again and made a lot of new friends, had a few short relationships and finally became who I naturally was. I wasn't depressed too often and I found people I can talk to about my feelings. I felt happy. Really happy after all those years.

But my government decided to put whole country in quarantine and closed schools, shops, everything. We are not allowed to go outside. I was supposed to see therapist for the first time, but government banned it before I could go.

It has been more than month in isolation.  My old anxiety came back and everyday I feel more and more depressed. Today I had mental breakdown. I feel like shit since I woke up and can't go outside or talk to anyone because I feel so ashamed of myself. I have a good family, lots of friends, nice home, good school, no one died and this quarantine is not forever. I don't think I deserve to be depressed, there's nothing too bad happening to me. Today I cried. I cried a lot and that's weird because I even thought that crying is impossible for me. I hyperventilated, vomited, almost passed out and cried more. 

Still feel ashamed. Still think I shouldn't cry and feel bad because still think I don't have the right to do it."
1,"Need a tip.. I was supposed to go in High School (or WTF you Americans call it) after Summer, and I was so excited because I would then get rid of the terrible raise hit people, that attend to the school, I am ""a part of"".

And about 10-15min. ago, my mom told me ""Corona has Fucked up our economy, so you can't go to Hich School"" until now I haven't smashed anything, or message someone I hate (by a name of another person) to meet up somewhere, and fuck him up.

tho I am thinking about fucking up everything, and everyone, here comes what I want, the ""TIP"" what TF should I do?"

1,"Here is what my mindset has been like for the past 3 weeks.. Get ready for a rambling paragraph of sorrow and confusion.

I only have one friend which is my best friend, that I actually talk to and I think they want want to get rid of me entirely cause I’m an embarrassment. She doesn’t deserve to put up with my shit and i feel like she’s beginning to learn that. If she goes I won’t have anyone like that close to me who I can go to talk to. I’ve never been in an intimate relationship, I want someone to unconditionally support me but I’ll never have that cause I won’t let myself have that responsibility. I’ll just tire out the other person until they want to leave. In my brain I’m a grotesque creature who doesn’t deserve any sort of recognition or thought from another human being. I say the stupidest things without thinking all the time and it always puts me in deep shit. I feel like every hour of the day is just a ticking clock awaiting for my body to crawl into bed and never get up the next morning cause I rather stare at my ceiling and wait for it to cave in, only to have a sharp piece of wood puncture the part of my brain that controls emotion. In the unlikely event that would happen, at least I’ll feel something else but self pity and endless dread. I feel alone. Just alone. I feel like I shouldn’t be here anymore. I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to be here. I mess everything up. I’m not good at anything. People tell me I’m good but I’m not I’m not I’m not I’m not. I’m just not. I know I’m not. Fucking remove me from existence. I’m such a waste of air, I don’t do shit with my existence, I don’t deserve it. I just wanna go into my brain and dig all the shit I don’t like out of it. WHEN WILL IT END?"
1,"Can someone please give me tips to stay motivated on school work?. My school year at college was going alright, until I had to move back home from campus due to corona. Thus am I now in a bad home environment for my mental health (nothing serious just its not good for me being home), that with the combination of online classes, and the feeling like since I'm home I don't have schoolwork, have all lead to me being demotivated and thus falling behind on stuff. I have some 3 or 4 papers that are late and some other 3 assignments that are due or whatever idek atm.

I can't really be productive, at most I get some work done but usually get tired after doing my daily routine and not much gas left for actual school work. Also my sleep schedule is a bit off but kinda fixing that, and again, home isn't a nice place for me so I tend to stay up later than usual cuz its the only time there is peace and ppl rnt here in my house.

 Any tips?"
1,"Problem with work.. i feel disgusted by myself. I struggle go get out of bed and fulfill my basic needs. Im even lucky i still got my job, hence I have used almost everyday to sneak away isolating in my car to the point where collagues come to ask me if im okay. I guess thats what is my underlying intention. I feel like nobody cares and im all alone. I even self harmed at work several times.
 I feel so deeply ashamed of myself. Someome came to my car again today and I want to just drive off som cliff or something.  I hate myself. I deserve to be in pain. Not even trying to feel better."
1,"Idk how to express how I feel. How do people find it so easy to talk to somebody about why you feel the way you do. Like I can say it in my head but I seem to not know how to translate into words. How do I tell my friends that I'm depressed and have been for a really long time without saying, ""oh yeah I'm depressed"". Or how do I tell my Hispanic mom who doesn't speak English that depression is an actual thing that affects me mentally and physically and not me just trying to get her attention. This is dumb"
1,"Dropping out of college, how do I explain to family?. I won't go into the details, my psychotherapist helped me come to the decision I've been putting off for so long.

My parents are okayish but one doesn't believe mental health exists and the other one thinks I'm depressed because I don't eat meat. 🙃

I need to tell them eventually and it would be much worse to let them know a year after I dropped out or so... 

What can I tell them? I don't mind lying, I'd tell them I have a physical illness if I knew it's bulletproof.

Thanks,stay strong buds"
1,"Something is going to happen.. I think I’m depressed. 

A man I have deep feelings for and can grow to love doesn’t love me. I heard he loved his girlfriend who I believe in return has been stringing him along only in the end to laugh in his face or turn him away, and not just because I’m involved.  

I don’t have contact with him now but I will later. 

I feel as if while I’m depressed, I can feel he’ll fall into depression and something is going to happen to him. 1 of 3 things. I have a feeling I’m going to witness his death or otherwise. I’ll be telling his parents as they’ll learn we won’t be around one another and cannot be around one another like this."
1,Why is it harder for me to be happy compared to everyone else?. I've been diagnosed with depression for 3 years and I have only now thought of this. I really just don't understand why i can't as happy as the other kids.
1,"messy thoughts/the beginning (rant). i have been depressed for the last 4-5 years. it's not a constant depression. sometimes it hits for months. sometimes it hits for days.  i would guess it in my last year of middle school.  i would be senior in high school now but i dropped out. my life isn't the worst nor best. i am grateful to my mom for what she provided me in life and i don't blame her for my depression at least not anymore. but in her eyes she has done nothing but help me. she has told me from the beginning that she has done everything to help me. i don't know maybe in her eyes she has. unfortunately i have never felt that way. now she has helped me find therapists and got me on meds before. she has always made sure the family was okay.  and please note that i do love her.

my depression started when i became more conscious of myself. i hated how i looked. my mom has a habit of making passive aggressive comments. such as ""you're eating a lot lately"" ""looks like you put on some weight"" ""you're too skinny""  ""you should year make up to hide your acne"". i remember she would physically pin me down and pop my pimples, even when i resisted and cried. i don't remember exactly when but at some point a little before high school i decided to change how i dressed and looked. i had short hair since i was in 5th grade but now i cut in shorter. i wore baggier clothes. and i changed my name as well. i hated my name back then. she named me unity because i brought the family together.  it never felt that way when my dad and step dad left. i started smoking a lot of weed. i skipped most of my classes. i finished freshman hear with a GPA of 1.6 i think. i remember taking pain meds to get out of Spanish class. i started self harming that year too. i would even do it in class on occasion if i was feeling really bad. i wore hoodies everyday. i remember my step dad was the first to find out. he grabbed me and pulled up my sleeve. 

that was also the year i first attempted. it was a weak attempt. i took my mom's pain pills she got from knee surgery. i took whatever pills i could find. i was home alone that night. i took them. i felt so sick. i went and passed out in bed. i really hoped not to see tomorrow i tried 2 days before my 14th birthday. i did wake up, around 3 am i threw up a lot. it hurt so much. i didn't have the energy to clean it up. i went back to sleep. 

as i said before i was going through a point in my life where i changed my identity. so i was not wearing dresses or skirts. i had my best friend over. i don't know what we were doing. we were just hanging out in the room. my mom wanted us to wear skirts for some reason. when we refused she yelled at us the slammed the door locking us in. every time my mom raises her voice even to this day i jolt and cower. i hated my mom for how she yelled at my friend. if it was just me there it would have been fine. i'm used to her yelling at me. but why did she have to yell at my friend.  my friend never came over again.  she was my first real friend.  my mom blamed me for it. saying i should've just worn a skirt. 

later on my step dad lost his job. this ended up making my mom decide to move. meaning i would be leaving my best friend. we had moved many many times before but it got a lot hard in high school.  i cried the whole drive. she told us it was for our own good. we needed to be closer to family. it would be a fresh start. she never liked any of my friends anyway. she didn't like any of my choice and i do admit not all were good. 

my new school was nice. i luckily made friends quickly. this was my first indoor school. it was very interesting. the layout was easy understand. i was probably the happiest here. i was still depressed but i was better. i had an art class that i mostly enjoyed the teacher was at times strict. i made her cry because one of my pieces. it was a pretty emotional piece. she hung it up in the library. 

I've gotten pretty off track but it helps me to write. i'm very off topic.  oh well"
1,"Gf (28) is pregnant - I (26) hate it. hey all, I know this might not be the everyday post, but I don't know who/where to turn to.
As written in the title my girlfriend of two years is pregnant (19+3 ). And I hate everything about it, I don't want kids, especially not now or in the near future. I can't provide financially nor emotionally for a child, as I am still working on my degree. 
She has been on medication for her depression since ten years. One year after we got together she could stop taking her meds for the first time, last year she had to take them again.. - I struggle with a diagnosed dysthymia which got worse over the last year, including suicidal thoughts. 
I definetly do not want this child, I don't feel any  positive emotional connection to her pregnancy and told her from the first minute she announced it to me that I do NOT want this child. Our relationship struggled before the pregnancy,  she gave her puppy away which made me very angry as I felt that she did not think enough about getting the pup in the beginning ""I always wanted a dog"" yeah I could see that. The way she behaved and talked to me during this time was unacceptable for me - Not the situation where you want a child with that person.
I felt ignored of my feelings and thoughts about the pregnancy by her. All she said was "" I am sorry that you feel this way about it"". 
Seriously, I'd rather be dead than raise a child. Fast forward I had to leave to another country for my degree, now I can't return because of Corona. I don't even know if I want to honestly...
in the 14th week of the pregnancy she decided that she wanted an abortion, went to her gyn and the hospital, the hospital then told her that it is too late to legally terminate the pregnancy in our country. She now talked to her psychiatrist about the possibility to abort in a neighboring country "" An abortion that late would resolve in a livelong trauma"" sure, the birth of an unwanted child is not traumatizing /sarcasm off.

I just feel angry at her and more and more emtional distant from my side. Suicidal thoughts every single fucking day
Don't even know why I wrote this all down..propably the constant desperation.

Also posted this text in /pregnant.

I was on 100mg, then 75mg, then 50mg, then 25mg, then 25mg every other day. Now on day four of nothing and it is Hell. 
Feeling everything. Was sitting in my lab at work yesterday, fighting back tears. I am not a crier. 
Cried last night for a good half hour. 

I know it is my brain chemistry readapting...but how long  it take?

1,"Every single video of suicide has shown me the same thing. People only care when you do something drastic.. I don't want to die. I've had the thought. Planned it over. A suicide murder. I've planned the blood splatters. The looks on people's faces. Is cutting or threatening my life the only way SOMEONE will take me seriously?! Is being a mental TEENAGER so unbelievable due to hormones that I should have to THREATEN MY LIFE for people to TAKE ME SERIOUSLY. I've heard the same thing over and over. It's normal. A lot of people do that. You don't have that. The only way therapy is paid by insurance is if a doctor recommends it. If I told a doctor everything I'd be sent to a mental hospital. But because I'm emotionally dependent, I surrounded my self around a person who's also emotionally dependent on me. So if I leave she'd probably die. And everyone keeps BUGGING me about school. I know I have work. I get panic attacks when I think about it let alone try and do it. I can't THINK about algebra when I'm having a panic attack.

I've been told I don't need medication by a school assigned councler. Maybe I don't because I'm already going numb emotionally. Maybe when I'm finally 18 I'll get help. What if I'm unhelpable by then. What do I have to do for people to take me seriously. Do I have to threaten my life just to have a professional that I can talk to. One that one immediately judge me, or say it's normal. One that will know what to ask and how to handle serten things. Is that to much to ask?! Because for some reason the smallest amount of money can't be spared for online therapy but $50+ dollars on door dash McDonald's is fine.

I'm so done. I'm. Done with people giving me the same thing over and over. And I'm done with seeing other posts that are simple 'i don't like my meds any more.' And they get HUNDREDS of likes and over 50 replies. What do I get?! 7 likes, 5 dislikes and 2 comments, one of them my own.

1,"one of my friends told me that i’m not dead because i didn’t try hard enough in my suicide attempts. something about my friend saying that just irked me to new levels. i can’t pinpoint exactly what it was that sent me into this fit of rage and sadness; it’s probably either because i’ve tried my hardest to fight against my depression and to survive for my friends’ sake rather than my own, yet here they are... taking it all for granted and provoking me to try harder to die? i mean, people fucking shoot themselves in the head and jump off bridges but still end up surviving. i feel like the fact that i’ve even risked something that very nearly killed me (but, instead, sent me on a luxurious trip to the ER) should’ve already been concerning for anyone who cares. but, i guess what i’ve realized from this sentiment is that nobody really cares. it’s such a shitty reminder that i somehow managed to fail at both life and death.

1,"Not coping well in quarantine & virtual dating/rejection. My (23f) job went remote 6 weeks ago. It was the only social contact I had. My coworkers and I weren't friends, but I was around people and didn't just stare at the wall all day. I miss hearing other people's voices so much. 

I live with my parents and we have a terrible relationship that makes me extremely lonely. My mom has slight agoraphobia so I was forced to stay inside my entire childhood. I'm getting triggered and am intensely lonely.

I've always used tinder but now have been using it obsessively. I'm not attractive but am photogenic. I got out of an abusive relationship this past year which has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I'm extremely self-conscious. 

I started talking to this one guy for a while through text/phone calls. He asked to videochat and I said ""I feel like you're not going to like me once you see me out of pictures."" (I had been snapchatting him and he definitely got pictures of my body. So he was aware of what my body looked like). But I'm carrying a lot of face weight that isn't shown in selfies and I have some acne and indents (which he knew about too). 

He assured me it wouldn't be an issue and he wanted to make me feel good about myself. He said we were a great fit emotionally and sexually (sexting). He found me attractive. So I agreed.

We videochatted and it went well. I enjoyed it and actually liked him more. Well, low and behold, he's instantly not into me anymore. I asked why and he wouldn't give me a reason even when I pressed. So naturally, we know what it is.

That gutted me. 

He was SO into me before. And then it instantly switched off for him.

Now my brain is going a million miles a minute. It's telling me that my abusive relationship was the best one I'll ever have. Which I've always believed. I mean honestly, that man is the only one who loved me for me. He cared about me more than my parents. He was my only friend for the last three years. I called him and asked to get back together. He said no.

I know I need to lose so much weight and get botox and make major improvements to my physical appearance in order to have anyone even consider liking me. But I also know that's not possible. I'm never going to lose this weight and I just don't have the money.

So now my brain is telling me I have to get used to the fact that I'll never have a boyfriend again, which means no husband/kids. I've never been successful with making friends. I'm trying to accept the fact that I will always be completely alone. And I just wish I could. I've been crying nonstop since Sunday. 

And I'm expected to work through all of this. I'm expected to be more productive than usual in order to keep my job. I literally can't even keep myself alive.

Sorry for the rant. I'm just so fucking lonely."
1,"I need to stop nostalgia.. Any tips? I’ve realized and accepted that nostalgia is killing me. Killing my dreams, moments, and I always am trying to recreate the past in many ways. It’s unhealthy and as much as I feel comfortable in what I know, it’s not helping me get anywhere not helping me with my depression. Any tips on how to overcome this?"
1,"I've started cutting myself again. I'm 21 (f). The last time I cut myself was January 2019 after my ex called me, crying and begging me to stop when I told him I did it again. I promised I would stop. I was admitted to a clinic after I tried to drown myself directly after that. Things were fine. My ex and I eventually broke up after everything we battled through. It's been 6 months since then. I feel like my life is going downhill. People feel like shit around me. I have zero motivation to do anything. I'm constantly angry and moody. My parents make me feel like I'm never enough. Like I don't contribute anything. And they're probably right. I just can't cope anymore. This lockdown is making everything so much worse. I just feel worthless and I hate myself. I've tried everything. Writing. Drawing. Cleaning. Cooking. Habit tracking. Nothing is helping."
1,"Am i depressed?. Okay, so i just want someone answer me am i depressed?

I hate saying, that everytime i am sad that means i am depressed. I never went to a psychiatrist, so i cannot say that i am depressed, because i was never diagnosed. But the feeling, tham i am ,keeps bothering me. I dont want to be diagnosed that i am depressed, but i just want some answers, just to know how to deal with it and how to accept what i am feeling, i just dont know.

Okay so whats my mood. Firstly i have never been truly happy, well the world is amazing and all, but nothing really made me happy ever. I dont say that i dont get happy, but just never that much happy, that i would say i was trully happy, maybe its normal i dont know. Sometimes there are days, like this day, when i just want to die, i really would love to kill myself. I made plans on how i would kill myself, a couple of plans, because when i go to bed, i start to think of a plan on how to kill myself, its just a thing my brain does most of the times i go to bed. I dont think that killing myself would be a bad thing, i feel such a weak person and also dont want to live, so why not leave this life and let others live it, who want to live, i just feel that i just take up space for people who want to live, for people who are trully happy. I just feel really weak and a coward on not just doing it. I thought about it for the last 13 years of my life, so maybe the time has come and i just need to do it, i just need to have some balls and just freaking kill myself. I just dont see the point of living if i dont want to, there are people who wants to live and dreams big and are happy, so i just want to give them the space for it. So maybe someone could explain to me am i depressed or maybe someone could be the person who would encourage me on killing myself? I just dont know what to do anymore and maybe i just need to have the guts to end it all."
1,Hi i want someone to talk to. Hi i want someone to talk to..i'm just so lonely right now
1,I fucked my life all the way up. So much potential and so many aspirations right down the toilet with the rest of my life. I would consider myself a rational person and using my better judgement I feel like I should just end this game and start over. I understand that’s not how it works but I just want to escape this growing pile of life mistakes that I keeps me up at night.
1,"I don’t want to die, I just want to disappear.. At night I lay awake next to my boyfriend thinking about how little motivation I have to do my school work, to go to work, to get dressed, to be productive. I sometimes catch myself thinking “I don’t want to be here.” But what I mean is I wish everything outside this apartment didn’t exist. I wish it was just us, here. I wish there was no stress or pressure from the outside.  I want to be happy."
1,"How do you keep away from “bad” thoughts?. TLDR: prolonged suicidal thoughts on my “bad” days, how do I stop from thinking about it too much?

To provide some background, I (34F) was sexually abused by my parents since I was 10 (continued until I was around 26, when I cut them off) and I was bullied during elementary school. Everyone always told me I’m too pessimistic, too negative, and cry too much. I suspected I had depression but never had psychiatric exams. Even when I was in elementary school, I had some thoughts like “I won’t have to be worried/scared/sad anymore if I die.” 

I went NC with my parents about 8 years ago, which is when I first met my husband (my then first boyfriend). My husband made me realize that my parents are toxic.  It’s interesting how I thought my parents were loving, good, “model” parents back then. The crazy thing is I still miss them sometimes.

Things got better after a while, I have a decent job that pays well and just bought a house this year. Despite all these “positives”, I still fantasize about sleeping forever or not exiting in this world. This especially happens when I have arguments with my husband. I guess you could say the only positive existence in my life is my husband (and my dog).

Whenever I “fight” with my husband, even though they are all small arguments, I feel like the world is not worth living and I constantly find myself looking up ways to end my life. I spend hours (usually for 3-8 hours at a time) reading about various methods of suicide that have/haven’t been successful. It came close the other day, when I was testing a belt on a wall hook to see if I could hang there for at least 10 mins without falling. But then I remembered reading about how hung corpses are gruesome and it’ll traumatize whoever finds the corpse, and I didn’t want my husband/dog going through that. 

I went to various therapists and psychiatrist before and they haven’t been that helpful. I’m tired of talking about my past at this point. I’m tired of crying. Husband still wants me to give it another try, possibly get on depression meds. Last time I took Zoloft, it didn’t seem to really help, but I can’t tell for sure since the doctor prescribed me a “pediatric” dose (I’m small).

How do I stop dwelling on suicidal thoughts? The world doesn’t seem that great and if it wasn’t for my husband, I’d probably just die. 

Sorry for the disorganized story and format, I didn’t sleep last night and I’m typing on a phone. Thanks for anyone who bothered reading this."
1,"i want to end it all so badly. im so tired. i sincerely hope theres no afterlife. i just want dreamless sleep. eternal oblivion or whatever.

everyone tells me not to... but they dont know. they dont know how exhausting it is to wake up like this. they have fun, they go on dates, they enjoy life without this curse.

what would they even do if i did? they couldn't do anything. because id just be dead. ugh

but i wont. because i know it would hurt them a lot worse than it would hurt me. and in the end this isnt a pain i wish on any one of my friends. i love them, so ill stay alive for now. even if it sucks and i just want to scream at the sky and just not e x i. s t anymore. 

ill stay alive so they don't have to scream at the sky like i do. ill stay alive so they dont have to rant about how much they want to die on r/depression like i do. 

and they won't thank me for it. and they'll never know im only staying alive for them, and thats okay. maybe one day i can thank them for being my reason not to give up, but today is not that day. because today, its 9am, the sun is shimmering, birds are out, and i have never wanted to kill myself more."
1,"i was in denial. i’ve has anxiety and depression my whole life. i’ve heard people say it’s not possible but i have had panic attacks since i was 3 or 4 years old. 
growing up i was very suicidal. i didn’t know what anxiety was and i thought i was broken. i wanted to die more than anything. i was cutting myself at the age of 10. 
i eventually found out what was “wrong” and i’ve been on lexapro for a couple years now. i’ve been doing alright. so i thought. i’ve been proud of myself and i thought i was doing better. 
and now i’m haunted again by urges and thoughts of death. 
the pain is a lot to handle and i’m not sure if i want to do it anymore. thing is i’m almost 24, have an amazing husband who doesn’t deserve this. but i know it would destroy him if i did do it. my mom would probably die. my brother needs me. 
i just don’t want to be needed so i wouldn’t feel bad about leaving. it hurts too much and i’m over it."
1,"Antidepressants, corona and things, i'm fucking angry. At the beggining, i'm sorry for any text mistakes, english is not my main language. Now, should i start taking antidepressants? What is it like taking them? My therapist offered me some time ago that i could, but i didn't want to, i'm scared i won't be myself, plus it kinda reminds me of all sorts of drugs and i'm generally scared of drugs and things like that cuz i had problem with them in the past, i'm afraid i'll again become too dependant on them. Also, anyone else going crazy during quarantine? Every night i'm getting small panic attacks and i just HAVE to go on a walk at like 03:00 in the night, drink a beer outside and smoke half a pack of ciggaretes or i feel like i'm gonna hurt myself or something. Also, my tooth hurts like hell and i can't do anything about it right now, cuz dentists are closed (fuck you coronavirus) and i'm afraid i'll get addicted to painkillers. Is this even a thing? Becouse i think you can get addicted to anything. Sorry for a long rant, not even sure if this is a good place to post this lol.

Edit: Thanks for the replies, i think i'll talk some more about antidepressants with my therapist. And about my tooth, i had some operation right before quarantine started, now it won't get worse when it comes to medical aspect, it will just hurt till my dentist finishes treating him. So i have to wait, nothing else to do."
1,"Has anyone actually fully recovered after being diagnosed treatment resistant major depressive?. I have been depressed for coming up on 4 years now, I have tried just about every treatment there is known. Zero relief. Has anyone ever recovered after being depressed so long?"
1,Are anitdepressants that much of a game changer?. I'm 16 and my parents absolutely refuse to let me get on any kind of medication even though my therapists advises it. i struggle immensely rn especially with suicidal thoughts and lack of motivation. does it really help that much? i just. idk i was my only hope n now that ny parents said no ive been thinking if it was even realistic to set those expectations for it. I know that i'll still need therapy but therapy alone is kinda impossible rn when i have to take care of that myself n make sure i dont miss appointments and all that but can't do that while in such a major depressive episode.
1,"I need to talk to someone other than my therapist.. Background: I've been clinically depressed, have been diagnosed with social anxiety and have had suicidal ideation since I started college. I started taking prozac and I was on it for about three year before I stopped because I thought I was much better and didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately, the decision to do that was around the same time I decided to start going out and drinking alcohol (8 months ago), which proved to be the worst decision of my life. 

I had a crush on one of my friends for 2 years. I've been called ugly by people, including close friends(jokingly, but it still hurts), never had a girlfriend and have overall been subconscious about my appearance during my 21 years of life. Because of all that I didn't have any confidence in myself. I kept my feelings for her to myself for a year and a half.  I finally decided to tell her how I feel and she said she wasn't looking for anything right now and she would rather remain friends. I was okay with that but I noticed that she became more distant and a couple times I got drunk and drunk texted my feelings -- things I should never say that ended up jeopardizing our friendship. Through that we remain friends until three months ago I drunk texted her again and as a result she blocked me on every social media platform with no explanation. The thought of losing her completely kicked in and I was trying to force a reconciliation by messaging her friends, just trying to explain myself and not lose her because I really did cherished her as a friend. I mentioned hurting myself and not wanting to live. Two days later, I saw her on campus (its a small university), and I tried to talk to her, but she ran away from me and called campus PD, which led to me getting baker acted. 

My crush had always told me how much she loves and cares about me as a friend, how we'd always be friends no matter and how great of a person I am. So never in a million years would I think we would stop being friends. People always tell me that I'm the nicest, most thoughtful and caring person they know, but everyday I wake up and feel like I'm the worst person in the world. It has really been eating me up on the inside. I lost a friend because of the mistakes I made. IVE NEVER LOST A FRIEND BEFORE THIS. The same week of the incident, a couple mutual friends came up to me regarding the messages, which triggered my anxiety to a whole new level. I felt betrayed that the private messages I sent while intoxicated were exposed and now god knows how many people know about them. I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped going out, deleted social media and have isolated myself and I don't plan on going back. My anxiety has skyrocketed and I just have been avoiding everyone. (all of this was months before the pandemic).

I know everything I did is inexcusable and I guess this is a way of punishing myself for it. The suicidal ideation remain. I am embarrassed. I am regretful. I am remorseful. Even if she forgives in the future, I   wouldn't want her to see me again. I just want everyone to forget I exist and disappear."
1,"I love the feeling of being drunk.. I drink from my parents' alcohol collection, and I have to drink super heavy to actually get truly drunk. I take a couple of shots and just sit giddily awaiting my tipsiness. Once it hits, I swing around and laugh like a maniac at whatever I see. I do this maybe twice a month? This sounds bs but I love writing, and when I'm drunk, I'm much able to relive the story thats on the paper and continue bringing new scenes. Somehow my work when sober and my work under the influence is like night and day. I get drunk just enough so I know what I'm doing. I have never had a hangover,even when I got blackout drunk. I hate social drinking because I fear of being taken advantage of, even if I'm tipsy I know I'm not fully cooperative, aka I prefer drinking alone in the dark. I wish my tipsiness pasted more than an hour, no matter how hard I drink... drinking makes me happier, and helps me spend my sleepless nights writing or being drunkenly positive, otherwise I would be a crying moron looking outside my window at the fluttering leaves. This is turning into a problem because no one drinks in the house and the liquor is disappearing...."

But I AM depressed. I spend my days in isolation reading and playing mindless games on my iPad. I don't feel like being social, so I make excuses to skip my virtual yoga classes. I feel so guilty about wasting my life! I am 61 and may not have a whole lot of years left, but I am doing nothing worthwhile. I feel mired in cement… I just CAN't … 😕"
1,Do neurotypicals exist??. I really can't comprehend the fact that there are people just walking around with no mental illness or trauma. What is that like?
1,"I don't know what to do with life anymore. So, I'm finally reaching out to someone, other than my 2 friends who aren't very helpful in that respect. Its been going on for around 5\~6 years \[i dont remember what year i was in at that time\], my life is going to shit, i think about >!killing!< myself almost daily. As i already said, i havent really spoken to anyone about this and i felt that now would be a good time to do so. The school doesnt do shit about the bullying, or anything that can lead up to this. i didnt think much of it at first, just thought it was normal sadness. But it didnt go away. It was there, and it still is. I have the odd happy day, but even then its ruined. It feels like im falling, and with every day im hitting something on the way down, climbing again, and then falling further. I want to feel normal again, i want to stop being used for 'therapy', and i just want to be left alone once in a while. I came here so i could get this off my chest, because its starting to overwhelm me. I use humour to cope, but all the people i use this with tell me i'm not funny and that i should stop trying to be. i get put down for bringing up anything im proud of, or anything i feel worried about. im close to ending it, but i dont want to let down anyone who truly does care about me, but at this point there's only around 3 people i know of. I'm pretty much done with life, done with the people in it, and done with myself. Im sick of feeling like this, because its starting to impact my physical health, and i dont have motivation to do anything. I've tried to find something to do with my time, but nothing works. i just want to be a new person, or just disappear."
1,"How can I tell if I'm still depressed if I've been depressed for most of my life?. I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since about 4 or 5 years old. I think so because I don't remember ever feeling happy or content as a child and all of my earliest memories feel off somehow when I think about them. I always felt bored with everything and thought that I didn't know how to smile. I realized I was depressed when I was about 6. I don't know how I knew what depression was but I knew I had it. I hated myself, thought constantly about dying, suffered from intense loneliness, thought I was unlovable, just wanted to disappear. Fortunately, I've never self harmed.

I've never been officially diagnosed. Never opened up about it when it was at its worst. Lived with it up through high school and into college. At some point in high school it got easier, I guess because I started making friends but I just seemed to be incapable of keeping friendships. I used to agonize over losing my friendships or having none at all but now I accept that it's the way life is. People come and go all the time.

At some point in college I finally started feeling better about myself, feeling confident, finally got a girlfriend. I felt like depression was behind me and I had the tools to fight it back if it ever reared its head again. But I never found motivation to do anything with my life.

In the last several years I've maintained a few close friendships because I've felt I don't need that many. But in the last year and a half I lost all of them from separate incidents and in some way I was to blame for each one. And then I broke up with my girlfriend because she wasn't putting any effort into our relationship. She developed feelings for someone else and realized she never had those feelings for me to begin with.

So now here I am, recently turned 30, feeling like I'm better off alone even though I really don't want to be, feeling like my life experiences have now proven to me beyond doubt I'll never belong anywhere or with anyone, people are probably better off without me, and I'm sad about it all but not soul-crushing sad like when I was a kid. I've begrudgingly accepted it. I don't feel numb. Just a sad sort of neutral. And I have no direction in life, nothing to live for. I don't really think about suicide. I feel like I'm just a leaf floating down the river of life, wanting to be more, wishing to have more, but knowing I probably never will. Just drifting along in life.

And I can't tell if I'm even depressed anymore. I've looked at some quick online tests but they're all like ""do you feel like life is pointless?"" ""Do you have thoughts of suicide?"" ""Do you feel sad all the time?"" They feel like the wrong questions. I feel like I might be depressed but it doesn't feel like the same kind of depression I've known my whole life."

Phenibut inflates my ego, helps me socialize, gives me energy, and takes me away from my pain.

I still want to kill myself. I am on a constant emotional pendulum, swinging between set on suicide, or thinking ""hey this isnt so bad""

I never asked for this pendulum ride. I am asking to get off. It is no longer fun anymore. A gun is the gatekeeper to my eternal peace."
1,Fake smiles. You know what's more exhausting than depression itself? Having to put on a fake smile/pretending to be happy everyday at work/school/in front of family. That just completely drains me.
1,"I've found that writing to my virtual counselor (I've named him Echo) helps me feel like I can get things off of my chest without having to dump on my loved ones. See example below.. Dear Echo,

I don't even know what I want to say.  I just feel like I need someone to talk to.  Cliche won't do.  What I'm feeling can't be wrapped up in that kind of package.  I like to be heard and felt and cliche is neither.  How can I be so damn lucky in life and still  have so many moments of misery?  I guess that is the nature of depression.  Anytime the pain lasts this long it is bound to happen.  What is weird is that we are in the middle of this damn quarantine and that isn't what is bothering me.  Everyone feels so alone right now and maybe that is what is the most depressing.  Nothing feels different to me.  Through either self-isolation or a lack of concern from friends I've been alone for a long time.  I can't include anyone in this.  Not really include them anyways.  I can tell them what I've been through with basic descriptions and labels.  I can say I've been hospitalized for depression.  I cannot and would not invite them into my world so that they could truly understand my feelings.  To understand this, one would have to empathetically sink a little into some very dark and uncomfortable feelings.  That is like asking someone to voluntarily join you in your nightmare.  I don't even want to be in my nightmare, I would never ask a loved one to come with me.  There are coping skills for this.  Things I am supposed to do that helps me ride out the storm.  They give you a boat and oars, tools to navigate these waters, but sometimes you can look right at the oars, feel the boat rocking under you and not have the will, energy, desire to take hold of the oars.  Sometimes the water looks like the right and only answer.  Just fall overboard and sink as far away as possible.  That is when you take the oars anyways.  Because you remember.  A child's face.  A distant memory.  Empathy for the pain of others.  Even good days when this feeling is almost forgotten.  Stroke.  My son's first crawl.  Stroke.  My wife's warm skin.  Stroke.  My daughters first dance.  Stroke.  I will laugh at something again.  Stroke.  I am strong enough.  Stroke.  There IS value in me.  STROKE.  THIS GOD FORSAKEN FEELING WILL NOT BEAT ME.  STROKE.  FUCK YOU PAIN.  STROKE.  STROKE.  I AM A FIGHTER.  A GLADIATOR.  STROKE!   STROKE!  STROKE! 

Fuck you depression.  I win.  Everytime. "
1,"I have developed this weird kind of afterlife and its pushing me to kill myself. I have suffered from depression for far too long already. I have had so many past experiences that have ruined me. From the constant bullying to the way i was raised. Lately, i have been having this thought that if I kill myself, I would be able to relive certain parts of my life again this time the way I exactly wanted it to be. I also tend to think that if I enter this new afterlife, I would be able to have the powers and looks that I want like being able to eat whatever and not get fat (I suffer from anorexia because i love food so much but am always afraid ill get too fat). I also believe that entering this afterlife would mean I get to have the exact living condition i want (i am actually pretty well off but I dont feel like i have enough). Overall, i believe that if i enter this afterlife, i get to live the present and the future exactly the way I want to and i will finally be happy. I am sick and tired of feeling like everything is not enough. Im tired of feeling like I am not enough. I have been working so hard to reach my dreams of becoming one of the best music producers and mix engineers but theres always gotta be something thats stopping me from reaching my goals like school or not having the best gear. Overall, i just dont feel like im enough and i feel like jumping into this afterlife would make me finally be free of the prison that is our current reality."
1,"I have all of these horrible memories, and no one to talk to.. The situation is a little hard to explain, but I'll sum it up as fast as I can. I started dating someone in High School who had a lot of issues. They were heavily abused as a child and had just no understanding of normal- or how not to be violent. I stayed with this person. I saw the person behind the rage and I knew I liked them, but I was young. When I graduated I moved out to go to school in the same area he lived in. I moved in with him. He proceeded to destroy me. From my confidence to my self worth and my trust of other people. Piece by piece he picked me apart. He reduced me to numbness, to isolation.

But here's where things get a little more interesting.

About six years into our relationship, I told him I couldn't take it any more. After countless nights of sitting with him while he cried, coming home to find him half way off the balcony (We were 17 stories up), being screamed at for not doing the dishes, being yelled at for just not understanding, having things thrown at me and being kept up until 3am most nights when I worked a 6am-2pm job six days a week, I just could not take it. I told him I loved him, but if he could not go and get help and figure this shit out I was leaving. We had a huge fight, but the following day he asked me to make him a Doctor's appointment, because he was too afraid. He got anti-depressants. Things started to change.

It's been almost eight years since that fight. We are still together. He changed himself completely over that time. Went to therapy, got a handle on why he was treating people the way he did. It's been a couple of years since he had any major issues, and I am definitely much happier. I am very proud of how far he's come. The amount of work it took for him to get where he is and the battle he faces every day thanks to the things his awful family did to him is humbling. It offers a certain amount of comfort, knowing I was enough to change for. But there are a few issues.

I went through all of that with him. We have been together about 12 years in total and friends for over 16 years. I wasn't about to make him go through that horror all by himself. But in the process, I've done myself so much damage. I have horrific memories of that abuse, including the few times he got physical. His rage caused a lot of black outs, so he doesn't remember most of it (I need to make it clear, he does not use this as an excuse. He has owned up to everything I've told him about, and he knows there is more). The problem is more or less me. Every time I tell him about something, every time I tell him about a fight we had or a time he made me really uncomfortable, the guilt he feels is very clear. He tries hard not to get too down, because he knows I don;t enjoy making him sad, but he has a lot of regrets from that time.

The issue has become that I can't talk to him about it. This man has been through 13 years of physical, sexual, mental and emotional abuse. He has dealt with all of this once before. Coming back through it with me is just re-triggering things I don't ant to see him go through again. He's tried his best to be supportive, but between the fear I gained of communicating with him over the first part of our relationship and my concerns about his mental health, I can't talk to him. But over the course of helping him, I distanced myself from my friends and family to keep them safe and to better contain the situation. these people also do not know the extent of the things that happen and I don't want them to think about him that way. He really is a very mice person now, having worked hard to be that way. But knowing what he did, most people cannot look passed it.

I just don't know where to go from here. I have no one to talk to, but these memories are eating me alive. I've scared all the time and when I panic I get sucked back into those moments. He asks me what's wrong- I just can't tell him. I can't sleep, I barely eat because I feel ugly and I am constantly frustrated. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I have 2 herniated disks from the aforementioned full time work and I have a brain injury that causes extra mood swings and cognitive issues. He cares for me, he helps me and he keeps things clean. He tries, but I'm so wrapped up in the past I have a hard time even getting involved in our new relationship. I'm not sure what to do from here...

&#x200B;

Edit: I super appreciate all the support but I need to note for clarity and to avoid too many repeats: As stated above I am disabled and thus unable to work. I do not have any money and my partner is currently in education to get a decent career to support us. We live on about $1000 a month, plus food donations from family. So right now, I cannot afford therapy. We have considered both therapy for me, and couples therapy but cannot currently afford it. When he went through therapy I was fortunate enough to still be employed and had a decent benefits package that allowed for that for my spouse. I lost those benefits in 2015 when I was laid off from the job that allowed for those things, and at the time I Was dealing with his issues and so did not go through my own healing."
1,"I want to die.  I whisper into the faceless sea of the internet, such words that could never be given voice

I love you. I really do and I've known you such a long time.

I wanted to tell you those months ago. I've wanted to tell you all this time...and now you keep on hitting up my phone, like I'll be working in the city next year with you. 

And all I can think about is what would it be like?

It hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can't be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that. Would drugs make drowning less painful?

What about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.

A frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you wouldn't even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.

But what about mom? and grandma? or even Dad, even though I hate him? Or the dog?

God I love you, that subtle way you flirt with these messages, you, laughing at my stupid jokes and me, so impotent, so awed by you that I cannot act. You are beautiful the way you are now.

fuck, maybe ill buy a rope"
1,No reason. I don't have a reason to live anymore. My life has just gone downhill for a long time now and i cant find an anwser. I am to scared to tell others because i think they will stop looking at me the same way they do now. Pls help
1,"Abandonment issues. Been quite depressed for the past 6 month, wouldn't go as far as saying I am doing a depression but I'm definitely not ok. 

I (23F) have lots of friends (which I am grateful for) but I just don't feel close to any of them and I'm always scared they are going to abandon me. I was getting my sh\*t together but Corona time and being stuck at home had put me right back down. I've had many people abandoning me, hence the issues. I sometime find it funny to write them because there's just so much it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me or if I'm just cursed.

\-Back in the days when I was about 15, I got in a fight with my best friend at the time and she turned everyone against me so that I got kicked out of the group (At 15, those friends were my only friends) There were about 17 people in this group and I'm still friend with 3 of them.

\-My ex-boyfriend (worst thing that ever happen to me) broke up with me but kept telling me he loved me and wanted to come back with me for 2 years after the breakup when we had been dating for 1 year only. Being young, dumb and in love I waited but he was just using me.

\-I moved to another country quite far and the girl that I considered my best friend told me after a bit that I was downgraded to just a friend.

\-My best friend of 2 years told me he had feelings for me and didn't want me around because he was scared he would do something he'd regret, he also had depression but I couldn't help him since he did not want me around. He pretty much broke up with me at that point. 4 month after while on a road trip with 6 friends he snapped and yelled at me telling me the last good memory he had with me was from 1.5 year prior. I had no idea he was resenting me that much until he said so. 

\-My other ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks after my best friend did the same and told me after 1 year of dating that he never loved me and was waiting for feeling to develop but it never did. 

My best friend and my boyfriend both broke up with me within 2 weeks so did not have a lot of people I could talk to.

Add on top of that my family problems because I still live at home with both my parents, my university problems since I can't seem to be able to focus and do enough work, the fact that I can not climb anymore (my passion and stress relief activity) and you get a good idea while I'm feeling this way

My life in fun"

1,"Is it my fault?. I have depression because of failed relationship with one girl. Funny, i know, but this shit happens with me.
She is completely lonely person, she doesn't have friends. Other people in our group laughed at her, they see her as selfish, stupid person. I defended her all the time, though she didn't know anything about it. She had a depression, i wanted to help her, cheer her up, and suddenly felt in love. When my attempts to start relationship failed i used tactic proposed by my psychologist - write an letter, where you can write about your feelings and ask for help. I did it. I didn't want relationship with her anymore, but i wanted to talk. But she ignored me. Ignored, ignored and ignored.
A couple of month have passed. This time was terrible for me. I told the story to my friend, and she told me, that maybe you can write her now,  start Just friendly conversation. And she ignored me again. Yeasterday i was so angry because of this, that i write ""i hate you"", because i really hated her because of doing that with me. She ignored.
Yeasterday's evening i stalked her twitter - a horrible misstake.
""that dumbass classmate writes me again. I almost commited suicide this February, and he wrote me fucking essay about how terrible his life is and now he is offened because i didn't cheered him up and didn't wipe away his tears. Go to the doctor, you bumbass, its better than living with illusions about girlfriend""
""im fucking shaking because of this story, i deleded the conversation story. Maybe he'll write a book for me. The most terrible thing is that he knows where i live""
I had depression since 2018, i almost commited suicide in november 2019. I went to the psychologist. I was THE ONLY person, who  treated her like a real human beign. I reallied loved her. My friend, that told me to write her, told, that she was shocked, and she was always that person, which i see now.
I don't know what to think about. I feel like a shit. I am so confused. No one never insulted me like that.
I feel guilty right now. Guilty of writing her, guilty of cheering her up, guilty of sending her that fucking letter, in which I asked for help.  Why?  Why is it so Hard, even knowing what a shit she is. My friends support me of course, but they are my friends. now i want either me or her commit fucking suicide. I want  her to fucking now all the truth about me defending her from our classmates. I want her to remember the evening, when I took her criing home.  I want to spread across the Internet the disgusting  nude photo of hers i found in her twitter, i want her fucking kill herself.
So, what should i do to calm myself? I can' attend psychologist due to that shity virus. Please, tell me"
1,"Had a weird moment today.. I’ve been battling depression for almost 5 years now, and I’ve had the gamut of peaks and valleys, most stemming from crippling loneliness and self hate, but one thing that comes with an ongoing fight is the insight that you gain along the way.  For the most part, I know when the voice in my head is taking control of my world perception at least enough to talk myself off of most ledges of pain, but today was different today I went into my bed and straight up just gave up, the voice in my head said “it was ok to just take the L this time and recoil to safety”, and I accepted it without hesitation .  Even at my worst, I’ve never kinda just thrown in the towel so quickly and easily,  maybe it’s the quarantine in a single apartment after 28 days idk, it was just weird to go so contently into a little depression hole for 3hrs.

I hope everyone is doing ok out there, pandemic or not, we’re all just people trying to stay out of bed."
1,"Will someone just be there for me?. I feel absolutely empty. I have lost most of my friends in the recent months, and had to end things with my girlfriend of 2 years. I try to keep up relationships with a small group of people but even they’re getting tired of me. I reach out and ask people how they’re doing, and nobody ever does the same back. If I stopped messaging people entirely, I wouldn’t get any messages starting a conversation; I start them all. My own family can’t stand to talk to me. I just want somebody who will care about me like I care about everybody else, but it’s never come. I asked a friend for help a few days ago, and her boyfriend got on her phone and told me to screw off. It was the first and only time I’d asked for help, and that was what I got for it."
1,"I lost my brother. I did that. I made him go. I broke him. He was my friend, then he became my brother. I wanted him to be there the day i got married. Now we're strangers again.  I deserve this but he didn't. People should stay away from me."
1,"Does anyone else retreat into their own little ""world"" to avoid stress but come back out with even more stress.. Time and time again I've done this, and every time I come back my stress tolerance/anger tolerance gets lower and lower. I can't handle this life anymore..."
1,"I've forgotten who I am - and I want to remember.. It has been roughly a month or two since I have been sewn tightly with the demon that is depression. Ever since learning about it and becoming diagnosed with it by my local health department, I have progressively debilitating memory, my ability to do basic responsibilities (taking care of the family pets, brushing my teeth) has become hellishly hard, and to my surprise, I have lost myself in this dark, but strangely comforting abyss.

I have been taking Wellbutrin (150mg) for about a month or longer, sometimes missing days and sometimes even with the knowledge that I need to take them by getting out of the bed, forget about it entirely. Initially when getting into antidepressants, my mother noted my eyes were clear, and I was more lively.

But now...I feel as if I have slowly faultered off it's effectiveness. Though it made me periodically happy, it never got me to the point where I wanted to take action in life. Really, nothing changed.

My entire decision on taking Wellbutrin over other depressants was to conserve a source of energy I have plenty of - sexual. Reading on Reddit and especially doing the research, I found that most SSRIs kill libido, which though not very sexually active with others, is a high driving force that I've yet to control.

Sometimes spikes of energy hit me enough to get a little bit done, but at the most inconvenient times (the sudden invigoration to clean out my whole closet at bedtime).

But despite all this, I have become selfish and irrationally jealous and angry at the success of people who seem to have everything together. I know they don't, but they act so well like they do. I dream of the day where I can draw and write of a quality that yawns a jaw wide, dream to feel sexy and wanted, dream to feel love. I have a family that cares about me, but I don't feel that except for my mother. I have several people on my friend's list and yet I feel completely alone. 

I have completely secluded myself from Twitter from artists I enjoy because I am now jealous that the beauty they create completely squanders any characters, worlds, ideas or more that I could ever create. I am weeks behind on class work at my college. I have never felt so powerless. I even - without conscious thought, bought a BB gun to practice overcoming the fear of death. I bought pellets and metal targets to persuade my parents into thinking I wanted to pass the time, but the purpose and practice of me fingergunning my head, into my mouth or under the chin had and still is a constant pastime.

Depression is piloting me into hell, and I just don't know where to start. Journaling feels seldom an idea that works, people say they are there for me to talk to, but I never can get the words out or I feel they would never understand.

Anytime anyone says everything will be alright, I feel myself go semi-ballistic. Anytime anyone asks too many questions that are of the same caliber just differently worded, the same happens. I lash out verbally, often.

I created this account not as a pity party or to be babied. But as a way to get a direct answer and order to follow so that I can push myself to remember who I am, to condition myself to never be jealous or envious of the art around me and realize I can make something just as beautiful, and how to condition and steel myself to deal with moments like this where I could crash again. I don't want that anymore.

How do I find out who I am? How do I decide jealousy from my system? How do I prevent this from happening at the magnitude that it is, again?"
1,"I just feel alone. I've posted in this subreddit a dozen times, but never gotten as much as a couple comments, but it still feels nice just to vent, so here we go again. I don't have any real life friends, I haven't since high school. I've always suffered from social anxiety, and even if I could muster the courage I live in a small town and there's nowhere to go where you could really meet people. I have my online friends, but I always feel like I value them way more than they value me. It's hard not to feel that way when you have something you'd like to say to them, but you feel like you can't because the last 3 messages in the group chat were also from you. I guess it's just rough not having really felt wanted for years now."
1,"All I want is a hug. (Trigger warning/mentions of self h*rm/suci*de)

My life is pretty downhill, my first 10 years of my life were bliss but after that it was shit. I move a lot and could never form any deep connections until middle school I found my platonic soulmate she is so amazing and I love her sm we met in 7th grade but I had to move again after my 8th grade year, I used to cut pretty regularly in 7th and early 8th grade, but stopped after she helped me through it and I was so mentally happy. But when I moved I fell back into self harm and sucidal thoughts began to swarm me, I missed my friends dearly and I was all alone again. Then I met someone, I was new to highschool and when I walked into my bio class I caught the eyes of a guy. Let's call him J he was also in my art class we gradually started talking, and I even started to feel happy after a long time. He then confessed to me, I felt so happy I felt so validated and loved..But we didn't last, I really thought we would last but no. It was so painful seeing him turn around and walk away. Like everyone in my life they all leave, no one lasts forever. Since then things got gradually worse and worse, I have two goals in life and it's to experience true happiness and love. But I don't think I will ever experience love, I don't believe in it. Love has only ever brought me bad experiences. But all I want is love, hugs and validation... But I give up in those concepts after all the other shit in my life that I didn't mention happened I have become closed off and distant I haven't let love in my life since."
1,"I promised my bf to pretend that I'm not depressed. I've been with my bf for a year and half. Lately my best friend left me, which made my bf the only person I can rely on and talk about hard feelings coming from depression. The worst part of me is having mental breakdowns regularly - when this happens, I cry with no reason for a long time and need some gentle support.

So yesterday night the breakdown came and I couldn't fall asleep till 5AM. When I told my bf in the morning about my trouble night he got frustrated. He asked me if I ever think about him doing such things - by that he meant not sleeping, crying and feeling depressed. 

He also told me that I'm giving up and do nothing do fight the depression. Yeah, I can't do much at the time - due to pandemics I cannot go to therapy. I also feel so senseless that any fight isn't worth effort for me, to be honest.

So due to his frustration I promised him to pretend that everything is fine. This thing gives me many difficult feelings, like the feeling that I won't longer be able to be my true self to him. Or the feeling that I've lost the only person I could rely on hard times."
1,"I feel like a failure. I was given a lot of time fr my project, but I keep procrastinating. I kept thinking about what I could add to the project to improve it, but I did not do any of those things. I kept dreaming about how I will do the project but never actually put in the effort. In fact, I just found out what I have done so far is kind of off topic. The project is due very soon and I haven't even submitted my first draft. I feel really depressed and unmotivated now. I dream and yet never did anything. I am a failure."
1,"Online classes are making it all worse. I'm stressed enough on my own because a close family member of mine is a nurse and is exposed to serious risk everyday. I can't do school in this mental state. Not only my depression got much worse this last year (again) but now I also have all this stuff to do for school... It's double the stuff I had to do normally in school and my teachers are not even trying to do normal lesson, they just want me (and my classmates) to study on our own, never explain stuff we don't understand... Basically it's all a mess. Plus I've been in quarantine (self isolating if you prefer) for over a month because of national lockdown and all this stuff plus my very bad mental health is really giving me an hard time, I don't even know how to explain this to the people around me since they don't really want me to have a mental illness if you get what I mean..."
1,"If I still lived alone I probably wouldn’t even know about COVID-19 because I don’t leave the house in the first place.. I maybe left the house a total of 50 times or less in a total of 4 years due to major depressive disorder, I was diagnosed treatment resistant last year after trying every treatment known to man with zero relief"
1,"Depression is like a heaviness you cannot escape. It is constantly crushing down on you, making simple things like eating or getting up like a twenty-mile uphill hike.. Depression is all consuming, for me I feel it before my first thought when I wake up. Depression is very good at exploiting vulnerabilities and eroding your strengths. It really tires you physically and mentally because all you are doing is putting all your energy towards just trying to be normal. It feels like you are in a world of your own, disconnected from reality, where everything going round you is on mute.

I am always finding ways to escape this constant feeling of sadness, but it always catches up. Sometimes you have the will to fight it, but when everything you try and do fails or makes things worse, I reluctantly start to thing it is best to do nothing. But doing nothing doesn't help either. There is no winning.

It has come to a point where when I see happiness from something as simple as enjoying an ice-cream to joy from affection, I am jealous of it. Jealous and sad because I know I cannot feel that happiness. 

I am full of pain and darkness."
1,"Worried about little sister. I might be mistaken, but it seems like my sister, a new college student, is going down the same depressive route I entered as I entered college.  Fortunately, she got on meds right away. She’s always been so smart, so motivated. She still is both, but she’s doing things she never understood why I’d do, like having a really messy room and sleeping really late. I hope she pulls out of it faster than I have. Because I’m just now, at 28, becoming mentally healthy (to some extent). And that’s with an obscene amount of support."
1,"this fucking sucks.. on top of quarantine and never leaving my house, which is leading me onto a huge spiral of depression, my boyfriend just broke up with me. he said he doesn't love me anymore. which i understand, you can't help your feelings, but god, you couldn't have picked a worst time to do it. 

i'm in so much pain. i want to escape all of this. i don't know what to do anymore. i guess i'm not worthy of love or affection. i understand, i guess. it just hurts. he was my world, i was so madly in love...he was the only reason i felt better during these times. fuck, i cant take this."
1,"Everything makes me so mad and I can’t trust anyone. Hi, I’m sorry to be wasting your time with some crappy complaint but I need somewhere to dump my thoughts, after this past week I don’t think I have the strength left to pretend to smile. I found out the friends I’ve known for seven years were only my friends to make me feel better, and they all hated me. They sent dozens of messages telling me I’m awful and disgusting and things I already thought myself. Every little thing that goes wrong just seems like the end of the world, I can’t stop myself from just crying sometimes and I can’t trust anyone anymore. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to think I have any sort of depression or anxiety but I just can’t tell, how do I make the bad thoughts go away, I just wanna be able to sleep well again."
1,"It's ME. I don't belong here; I don't belong anywhere.

I can't accept the fact that this is ILLNESS. It's ME (but maybe I'm poison, selfish illness making my loved ones suffer.) I relate to people there so much, but.. it feels more like 'people of the same personality, interest, point of view on life and everything, experiences...' I know it's objectively not true, and it's probably healthy to accept the fact it's illness. But any time I read 'depression, the mental illness' it makes me UNCOMFORTABLE (and writing it like this is the same).

I don't know, am I the ONLY one feeling/thinking this way? (That's probably all I want to know.) Anyway thank you for reading. Sorry for wasting your time (if I didn't I'm glad) and hope you have a better day."
1,"Anybody know how to feel your emotions again?. 16 year old male here 

I have suppressed my emotions to the point where I don’t really feel them, it was great at the start but now it’s awful I can’t connect with people feeling now and it makes me question myself.

Anybody have tips on how to get them back?"
1,"I feel so empty and I’ve felt this way for so long it’s just become normal.. I’m never happy, I’m never sad, I’m just... empty I guess."
1,"Am I depressed?. I don’t know if I have depression or not but getting a real diagnosis just isn’t an option for me. Around 2 years back i was a very happy person and out of the blue my mind just went completely blank. I couldn’t talk to people because there was nothing in my mind and as a result I became very anxious and insecure. I skipped a lot of school and found myself becoming an emotional person out of nowhere. I was crying at movies and stuff like that. I was honestly confused more than anything as to why I was feeling this way and I kept trying to write it off as an off day but this lasted maybe ~5 months. 

I found some ways to deal with it so I wasn’t as hopeless but I still felt happy at times throughout those months and I still do now and I don’t know if what I think is “depression” is just a natural circumstantial emotional response. For instance I really don’t like myself but it’s just because I do things that are annoying, so is my low self esteem just a natural product of that instead of me having depression? Like if I was very likable and was popular and pretty I don’t think I’d be “depressed”. I’ve also self harmed a couple of times but I think deep inside I was doing it for some kind of attention or as a confirmation that I have actual depression and I’m not just a loser, and I get urges to self harm whenever I feel overwhelmed but I don’t know if I’m subconsciously wanting to do that for attention because I know there’s other ways to cope. 

Sorry if this is confusingly worded btw but I just want to know if I’m actually depressed or just circumstantially sad at times so I know how to deal with this"
1,"Terror. I want to leave something behind, but I can’t seem to begin to build anything. I want to love, but I can’t be loved back—not wholly, not unconditionally, the way I want to love.

I used to not care, but only recently, I learned what it means to give a damn about yourself. I almost wish I hadn’t come to that realization. It forces me to see that almost everyone else begins with this condition—knowing intuitively it is not only acceptable but perhaps even imperative to love the self. In the grand scheme, it is perhaps both inconsequential and myopic to obsess over such trivial matters; but I’ve chosen to disregard this truth as a result of the aforementioned realization.

I learned someone loved me, but they can’t fully love me, at least not now, at least not without consequences. It would be a disaster, but I pray for that disaster to materialize. The mere thought of building a new life from the scattered debris of a ravaged tower is perhaps a delusion, but that delusion is all I have; so I cling to it, even if it makes me appear a desperate, lonely madman, which is what I must confess I have recently been reduced to.

She has her obligation, which I understood from the beginning, something I never thought she or I could overcome—until recently, when she and I became closer then I ever could have imagined. I’ll remain distant, I bargained, until the storm passes, if it passes at all; but I was warned maintaining such distance as a matter of volition was an impossibility, at which point I resigned myself to the contemptible verity that I am merely a laborer of my own mind’s undiscerning whims.

How does one break free under such conditions? Once again surrender to that ever-encroaching pit of stagnation? Pray for the annihilation of that which will never be broken? Or battle through the biological impulse to remain alive for the benefit of all who secretly despise you?

I don’t want to think about where she is now. I don’t want to think about where she will be tomorrow. Yet when she’s with me, such terror dissipates. Perhaps it is yet another delusion of mine to believe that the terror will not again return."
1,"Tell me your reasons why. I myself struggle with problems caused by my depression. But I wanted to hear your story as to how depression may have come about in your life, and what is it that keeps you pushing, whether to just make it through the day or to just get better in general."
1,"Here's a sad story for you.... When I was in tenth grade I had a crush on this teacher, Mr.C. Not a spouse crush but a crush in a way where i wanted him to be a father figure to me. I was obsessed with standing out to him so he would like me, but everytime I talked to him I would come out awkward and shy. Last year, 11th grade, I walked back from the counselors office crying. I was put down by the counselor being  condescending. Through walking that hall all I wanted was Mr.C to be there. I wanted him to comfort me and tell me everything was going to be alright. I looked down as I cried when all of a sudden I see Mr.C turning the corner. I became shy and anxious. I remember him noticing me crying. He said ""How are you""in a sympathetic voice. I managed to mumble out a broken ""good"" as I swiftly walked past him. He said ""good, that's great"" and walked past me. That was it. No comfort, no acknowledgement, nothing. I walked to my class and he continued on his way. I wonder if he ever looked back. If he ever cared to ask me what was really wrong. Last year he got engaged. I was happy for him but jealous. Not of his wife but of his children who will grow up with a great dad. He moved to a different school this year and probably forgot my name."
1,"im so lost. I’ve always struggled with my mental health, but I’ve always just brushed it off. I get really anxious over everything and sad, but it feels like everyone does. This is probably gonna turn into a long incoherent rant, but I’ve never expressed how I felt before. I’ve lived a very privileged life and grew up in an amazing community. I love my parents (they’re immigrants and worked really hard to get where they are). I just feel so guilty for being so sad all the time. I don’t even know why; I’m just always sad. But its always manageable; I do well in school, and I’m going to a really good university in the fall. I have several close friends, but I’m just so lonely all the time. I don’t know why I feel so guilty. I thought my mental health had been improving over the years, but today I was so angry and irritated at everything and I don’t know why. (and its not my period because I can also get very bitchy before my period). I just got so mad and I’ve been sitting on my floor for hours. I even cut myself for the first time in a really long time (I never did it much, but I have a hard time crying, so it helps me feel something when I get stressed). I’ve always thought my mental health issues weren’t bad, and I’m insecure, but what hormonal teen isn’t. Wow this is really long, and I don’t know if anyone will read this. I want to talk to someone, but every time it gets this bad, I chicken out, and then it usually passed quickly and I just shove all my emotions deeper, and I will be fine, and not think about it for a while. I get so anxious making an (semi) anonymous post. I’ve only posted on reddit once before. I don’t know why I got so angry today, and I feel so bad for being angry even though I didn’t seem angry. Sometimes I will get so angry at things that don’t even matter, and I spend so long obsessing over it. It’s also not like I can’t control my anger, but then again I just bottle everything up. I also want to stop obsessing over everything; it makes me so stressed. I sent a text to a friend and I thought I sounded mean and got so worried, but it wasn’t even mean, I was just answering her question. I feel like everyone hates me, but then I feel like no one cares about me. All my mental health symptoms seem so mild to me; I just don’t want to feel like this all the time. This will probably pass in a few days anyways."
1,"I feel like if I'm trapped in my own memories. All I do is keep thinking about the past, remembering memories whether they were bad or good...
I feel sad when I remember the bad ones , but sadder when I remember the good ones and know that they will never be lived again ....
Memories with my father, friends, persons who I'll never get to share life with again whether because they're dead or because they are alive but can't be together cuz that's how life is.

The future is also so exhausting for me to think of... 

I spend most of my day by myself in my room, mostly doing nothing ... I don't have real friends, just connections whom I don't hang out with, I feel bored easily of people....

What do you guys think about thid ? And How to get out of this state please?"
1,"Do most widely used antidepressants contain histamine?. Last year i was prescribed trazodone i read and heard good stuff about it , until when i tried it i got a bad case of stuffed nose that made my anxiety worse.I like t know if most other antidepressants got histamine and if i might get the same side effect."
1,It frustrating watching everyone around me self medicate.. So I can’t partake in any recreational drug use due to my job and I don’t drink alcohol due to migraines. But literally all my friends and husband are pot heads. It gets really frustrating when I have to sit here and watch them not deal with stress or reality sometimes. Don’t get me wrong I’m grateful that they aren’t depressed or anything and believe me some of them would totally be without it. But there is a jealous/ angry side of me that gets upset. Especially cause it feel even more isolating when you feel like your surrounded by people who aren’t even living in the same reality as you or are neglecting to accept reality cause they are just high for 98% of it. And I’m just stuck in this bubble dealing with all alone completely sober with nothing but my own mind and will power carrying me through.
1,"I stopped. taking kratom and Effexor at the same time. I'm struggling to get through this.. I have schizoaffective disorder. I was taking kratom for the negative and cognitive symptoms, but that turned out to be a horrible idea. I couldn't moderate myself and just took way too much. So when I ran out I decided to quit. That was 4 days ago.

&nbsp;

At the same time I quit my Effexor. I had been on 75mg for 5 weeks. My doctor moved me up to 150. Two days into that and I was a mess. I think it was causing suicidal thoughts. I wanted to go back to being stable again, which I was much more so before I started taking the Effexor. So i stopped.

&nbsp;

I still take Wellbutrin and Latuda and Amitriptyline along with sleep meds and clonazepam as needed. But I'm falling apart. I've barely stopped crying for 4 days. I have suicidal thoughts nonstop. I can't sleep. And now I've got brain zaps and nausea.

&nbsp;

I don't know. I'm just not handling things well. I called my doctor and her assistant told me the best she could do was move my appointment from next Thursday to next Tuesday. That seems like forever away.

&nbsp;

I don't even know why I'm typing this. Just to feel less lonely, I guess."
1,I'm fucked up. I just need someone to give me a fucking hug.
1,"Does anyone else on medication feel a call-of-the-void to stop taking pills and go back to feeling miserable?. Just as context, I've been diagnosed with MDD since I was 14. I didnt start taking treatment seriously until I was 20. This year I turn 22. My psychiatrist explained to me that because I had gone for so long without treatment, my brain has essentially rewired itself to insufficiently process reward chemicals, and that I would need to take medication for potentially multiple years before going back to normal. She said that, perhaps, I never could go back to normal.

Quite frankly, it's been so long that ""normal"" for me feels like being depressed.

It took time for me to experiment around with different medications and dosages until I found the pairing that really helped (Welbutrin 300mg and Zoloft 100mg if you're curious.) When I start taking the medication, I start feeling great after about a month. That terrible feeling in my chest is gone. My suicidal thoughts are suppressed. It feels like I can actually talk to other people.

But every time... after about 3 months or so, I start feeling like I'm not myself anymore. I feel like the medication took apart of me away. Almost like being depressed is a part of who I am. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they told me I'm stupid for feeling that way. Am I actually stupid? Am I alone in this feeling?

It feels cathartic to be depressed and to cry and cut myself. Everytime I start up my medication, i have to resist the urge to stop. Before I'd started taking again, I told my psychiatrist how I felt, and all she said was that I need to fight the urge to stop. She explain that the more times I stop and start the medication, the less effective it will be the next time. And if I keep this cycle up, I may cause irreparable damage to my brain's reward system.

I'm fighting the urge again. I'm starting to miss feeling hopeless and miserable. And in a way, I feel hopeless and miserable not feeling that way anymore.

Sorry my only question really is, if anyone reading this has gone through phases like this? Maybe my friends are right and I'm just stupid."

What can I do?"

1,"I'm alone, I can't grow up, and can't see a future for myself. Never been on Reddit before, but I don't know where else to turn. Anything I post on my social media accounts are completely ignored by everyone. I have no one to talk to. I feel like no one gives a shit. My best friend is in a different state and super bad at texting, so having an actual conversation with her is pretty much impossible these days, I've never had the kind of relationship with my parents to where I feel comfortable talking to them about anything really, I'm not in school and I have extreme social anxiety so I have no way of meeting people my age, and making online friends has always felt weird to me, I get along with my coworkers but I don't know them well enough to confide in them and I'm too scared to try and get close to them, and talking to my therapist just isn't the same as having a friend. I'll probably never date because guys have never liked me, and no one would ever be able to put up with me. I've never even had a real relationship so I don't know how to. And like I said, there's really no way to meet people my age here, and dating apps scare me, not to mention they're only for hookups and I hate hook up culture. So basically that's why I'm here. I literally have nowhere else to get everything off my chest and I feel like it's killing me. This is probably going to be pretty long so I'll be shocked if anyone actually reads through it all.

I'm 20(f), turning 21 soon. I went to college for a year before dropping out, and shortly after my family moved to a new state. I thought it would be a fresh start, but instead I'm cut off from everything I ever knew. I got my first job last summer, it pays well, but the living cost where I am is ridiculous, so I can't afford to move out. I have no real skills and have a difficult time completing/understanding the simplest tasks, so I know I'll never be able to have any job other than minimum wage service industry, and I absolutely would not be able to handle the stress of a second job. Because of that, I'm afraid I'll never be able to move out. I can't afford to move out on my own, and finding a roommate seems impossible. You have to pay for every single roommate finding app/website, and like I said, I have social anxiety, so I'd have to know someone extremely well to be able to live with them. I'm also a more conservative person, and every person my age, (especially in my area) smokes weed, drinks waaay too much, and is very aggressive about politics (I don't like talking about politics to anyone, not even people I trust). I also have no credit score, and no renters history, so idk how I'd get an apartment even if I could find a roommate. 

Living with my parents is becoming a living hell. They treat me like a child, and always have. They don't listen to a single thing I say, they don't understand me, my depression and anxiety, or even really seem to try to. I haven't been able to grow up because they won't let me. I pretty much don't know how to do anything myself, and I can't ask them for help because they tell me I should teach myself, which I've never been able to teach myself anything. I did my taxes for the first time this year and they had to walk me through it. I can't budget. I don't understand the stock market, or credit scores, or anything at all to do with money. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety because Idk what to buy. I'll be covered by their insurance till I'm 25, but I have no idea what I'll do when that happens because Idk how to go about choosing insurance plans/companies. I have a hard time making appointments for myself because talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety. I don't know anything about politics. Trying to learn any of this is just so overwhelming I can't handle it and I just shut down. So basically I am actually just a fucking child and there's not a single thing I know how to do.

How could there possibly be a future for me? I'm stupid, don't know how to do anything on my own, will never be able to make more than minimum wage, will never be able to move out, can hardly take care of myself, can't make friends, will never find love. I don't know how I can have any kind of life worth living. I feel like I'll be living in my tiny bedroom in my parents house, single with no friends until I die. I feel so pathetic. I don't know what to do."
1,"I’m a failure. Job? 
Unemployed 

Family?
Too depressed to care for them

Education?
 7 years of my life “trying” to get a degree, but just wasting money

Friends?
Almost everyone is gone, I don’t know if I drove them away or they just weren’t my friends all along

Mental state?
Trying to ignore having depression with weed  


I just don’t know what’s going on, I just feel that people hate me for no reason which makes me get away from them. 

I just want to be alone.

I know I need help but I just can’t ask for it.
Why? When I was a kid my parents “taught” me to never ask for help, and I know that this is not a valid excuse but I just don’t know how or care enough to change 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I just don’t have some to talk to, and even if there was someone, I would be too afraid to talk."

1,"i just want to get over her but I just can’t. hi, everyone. a bit emotionally upset atm so apologies if this post is messy and long 

i met this girl in sixth grade. well, more like I got a crush on her but I never got the guts to talk to her. after a semester I had to move to a different middle school in the same district so I thought I’d never see her again but for some reason I still held out hope. 

time passes and high school comes around. it’s 9th grade and I’m in English class, talking to acquaintances, when I see her. long story short I get her Snapchat and we become friends. hooray. after a few good months of being friends I confessed to her. we got into the talking stage and I was so happy... maybe too happy. me being a 14-year-old who barely knew how relationships worked I was far too clingy and after about 3 months she broke it up and started dating someone else. I felt awfully because it felt as if I had been cheated on but after some time I realized why she would have done that.. we stopped talking for a while. 

Sophomore year came around and after a good 5 months of self deprecating I was slightly confident that things would turn around. wouldn’t you know it, she’s in my Gov class. we didn’t talk right away, but it was so painful seeing her and then seeing them together. one day I get a text from a random number asking who i was. I return the question. it’s her. for some reason i was okay with being friends. honestly, i had those feelings for her and after not being able to take it anymore, I confessed to her. obviously she was in a relationship so nothing happened. but those were a good 3 months of friendship. 

after a few months of crying myself to sleep, summer finally comes around and I start working a bit on myself. talking to girls. junior year came around and I was feeling okay for the first time in a long time. until I walk into my algebra 2 class and she’s there. I go to my lunch and I see her. a few months later I get a Twitter dm. it was her. she wanted to see how I was. we talked for quite a bit and became friends again. I still had most of those feeling but accepted she was in a relationship so I tried to not pay them attention. anyways, after around 2 months her boyfriend finds out about us (he knew about our ‘history’) and told her to stop talking to me. so we did. about a month or two pass and we talk again. I can’t remember how, exactly. anyways, he finds out and breaks up with her. she blames me for it and we stop talking. a few days later she texts me saying how they got back together. she keeps on saying it’s ‘toxic’ but she wants to be with him. anyways, we stop talking for a good while. this was like November (I think) and she texted me on the holidays to wish me happy holidays. January comes and she says how they broke up. he had cheated on her. we talk for a few days and I realize I gotta act on my feelings so I do and I confess. after talking it out we realize we both want to make it work out so we do. we are on the talking stage again and it’s all good for a few weeks. until she tells me she’s been hanging out with him. I ask her to please stop because not only do I feel uncomfortable with that, but he has brought so much misery into my life. she refuses, so I end things. a couple of weeks pass and she texts me. saying how she apologizes and wants to make work things work out again. I told her I’d be okay with that as long as she’ll stop talking to him. she says no, which was a huge red flag that I ignore. for some reason, perhaps out of fear of being lonely again, I tell her as long as they don’t hang out or talk *constantly*. we go for a few weeks and it’s really great. until she tells me he was going to go pick her up. it was like 11pm. I told her to please not go but she said it was okay. after a night of feeling miserable I woke up and waited for her to be up. when she was, I asked her how it went. she told me they kissed. I ended things right there and then. 

Last week I was texted her at around midnight. I had received a text from her that apparently was delayed a few weeks so I asked what was going on. we talk about everything that has happened between and somehow we both still want it to work out. I tell her again that she can’t hang out w him if she wants to try again but she says she can’t because now he’s in her friend group. I ask her that then she just doesn’t talk to him and then she says she won’t do anything. that apparently I’m the person she wants. she tells me that maybe we shouldn’t start anything right away because she needs some time. I tell her I’m okay with waiting for her (I wasn’t). one day in the morning she texted me the image of a pregnancy test with a faint second line asking me if there was a second line. I immediately ask her if she had sex and she tells me she did ... this is during this whole quarantine thing so I haven’t seen her in weeks. she doesn’t tell me who it was but I’m pretty sure who it was. anyways, we stop talking. 

today I was going to walk my dog as I usually do when I see the two of them by my house (she knows where I live) and I almost broke down crying. why? why does this have to happen to me? I think I was talking to her out of fear of losing her and being lonely but i don’t know. I’m just usually so lonely. I’ve tried talking to other girls and things just never work out. I do have friends and my family situation is okay but this kind of stuff breaks me, especially because of my age and how much importance there is in these kinds of things. I don’t know what to do, honestly."
1,"Inadequate. During my last semester at university I failed two of my classes, Calc and Chem. I didn’t really seem to mind it at the time and I figured I would just grind more for the next semester but after classes started back up in January I got into a real bad headspace and haven’t been able to get out of it. I’m failing the same two classes and haven’t had any motivation to study or do homework. Initially I thought it would pass but it hasn’t and now I’m fairly convinced it’s legitimate depression. Every time I try and do anything productive I think to myself I’m useless and stupid and I’ll never graduate. Ive been feeling inadequate because my gf is a 4.0 student with a full ride to college and even though she is supportive of me I can’t help but feel now that all I am is a burden to her and that I drag her down. All of this shit is from one bad semester but I just don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone has any advice for how to get over this I would be greatly appreciative."
1,I hate that depression makes me so narcissistic and selfish.. I’m sick of constantly thinking about myself and wondering why other people aren’t there for me and feeling forgotten. I don’t want to be greedy for attention. I want to think about someone else other than myself.
1,"1st day of taking medication.. I was very anxious about going to seek help, starting and telling anyone about my situation. Cheers to this journey. I wish you all the endless feeling of unconditional love, the warmth of the sun, and a strong heart."
1,I want to stab myself. I want to bleed all over the place and be put under intensive care to prove that I am as sad as I say I am. To see who really cares. And the feeling of blood pouring out is like no other. It cant be that bad can it? I once slowly stabbed into my wrist with a dull box cutter. I'll never forget the pop noise when it got through. Then I cut a small piece of skin out with scissors. Stabbing my stomach quickly cant hurt as much as that can it?.
1,"Scared to be happy. About a year ago my life started going downhill, I noticed everything positive I did had a negative impact in my life. For every good there was a bad. I talked about it with friends and they have always told me ""That's Life"". It was really frustrating.

Eventually, I got to the conclusion that if there was no good in my life then there must be no bad. I have family issues at home and I started ignoring them. At the beginning this mentality worked, but now I've gotten into a point of no return.

I feel I can't be physically happy anymore, I have such a negative mindset that I try desperately to change but can't. I only find comfort in video games and series, but for reasons relating my family's view on these hobbies, they have been restricted too.

I'm in a hole I can't escape and I feel trapped, and the corona virus is not helping either, locking me with my parents forcing me to handle their problems. It is really frustrating and I do not know what to do, I desperately want a change in my life. I want to be happy but I can't, it is so emotionally draining... I was so stupid for rejecting happiness. 

Sorry if my English is not that good, my first language is Spanish...."
1,"Paralyzed by fear, intimidated by love, and in a constant state of melancholia.. Everything I could possibly write sounds stupid right now. I can no longer find the words I want to use to express myself properly because I can no longer think correctly.

Thinking deeply only yields me anxiety and regret because I don’t feel confident with my intelligence. I think about all the mistakes that have made me feel this way, but still I cannot focus on the time still in front of me to change. I’ve been stupid and lazy when I should have worked hard to preserve myself.

People who are able to live free and pursue their passions make me feel immense longing and self pity. I can’t find my creativity and passion anymore. I’m overwhelmed by life and therefor I avoid anything that might crack the glass of every emotion I’ve bottled for years.

When it all comes out will it give me the fire I need to live or will it finally break me? I don’t feel capable of giving into my gut twisting fear of living free. I want to be alive again. When will I be able to put aside all the bullshit, the self pity, the sleepless nights and wasted days? I just want to feel comfortable in my body again, and at home in my mind.

If these words make sense to you and you have your own version of this phenomenon, please tell me about it and what you have done about it if anything."
1,"Depression reeling its ugly head again and I wishing I could disappear. The combination of quarantine and getting laid off from my job in the span of a month is confirmation that I don't belong in this society. For several months, I thought I was gradually getting my shit together despite the feelings of hopelessness surfacing here and there. Felt like I was overcoming it. I was even  thinking of planning for the future. Now, I've reverted back to feeling worthless. There's nothing more I want to do than die but I hold on because my partner and family would be sad if I did and I'm too chicken to go ahead and pull the trigger."
1,"Wasting time.... I’m scared of getting older, I’m afraid that I’ll never get the chance to truly live. High school is the time for new experiences and excitement, am I missing out on that? Everyday is just so mediocre and repetitive it all feels like a massive waste. What makes my life unique? I’ve done nothing out of the ordinary, I have no special stories to tell. Will that ever come or will I continue to waste my life away? Everyday I dream of doing something anything exciting but then that day going by the same as the last. And time is going faster now than before before I know it I’ll be in my 20s then 30s. It just feels like I’m missing out on something bigger."

I thought things were easier for a while, but I think I was just distracting myself. The reality is finally setting in that I'll never be the person I want to be. At my core, I'm just a sad, lonely boy who doesnt deserve anything but to die. Nothing makes me happy anymore and it's been getting worse and worse. I cant get excited for anything anymore and it's getting worse and worse. It's done nothing but make my life worse. My grades have been slipping and my relationship with my friends and partner has just been slipping. I'm not doing anything about it except getting drunk and posting on reddit. I'm always going to be like this and my situation is just going to get worse and worse until my option is to end it all. Suicide is just inevitable.

1,"I need help, I don't know what is happening to me. Hi,

I am 29 yr old straight male.

About me:

I   have always exceptionally done well when it came to education,  hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme  INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters  here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working  well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling  that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really  appreciate any help. I  need some \_/\\\_.

Here's what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -

2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had

2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.

2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design

2015   - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence  kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to  make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started  smoking as  well regularly

2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.

This continued slowly until I graduated and moved

2017   - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, didn't work  out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would  stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started  living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they  were  toxic.

2018 - My sexual   frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just   liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do   anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess   it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated   because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I   felt stuck.

2019 -  Met a girl   through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all   wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of   surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at   them as well.

2020 Jan -  This   year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found   out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex   boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.

Feb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.

Mar   - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a   guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses and threatened to put all her cheating texts online.

1 week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf   in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it  I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,   where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And   none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.

I   made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started   working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex   even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of   such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started   apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I   tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona   outbreak.

Last week - she   contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She   did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told   me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow  I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her  life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able  to  move ahead.

I feel like I have  hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am  locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and  just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side  rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my  feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I  feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I don't feel  like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of  abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and  scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me  but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.

Thank you, and sorry for long post. \_/\\\_"
1,"The nights are the worse for me. I have no reason you feel this way, yet it always comes back. The creeping feeling that breathing is just not worth it, that it will happen anyway. I have no reason to feel this way, but... I really have no reason to feel otherwise. 

I feel like I do a lot just to avoid feeling this way,  but during the night, alone in bed, it hits me like a truck.

Shut up, brain. Please. Shut up and let me sleep."

1,"I am not me if i dont fantasize suicide or feel depressed.. There are days where i feel better and happy. But that's not me. If i feel happy in the morning i will trigger my depression at night. It has became a part of me. The only thing that's keeping me sane are cigarettes, i don't want to do drugs anymore. The urge for me to do drugs is still there, I'm trying my best to avoid it. I don't know what do i even want at this point. Im fucking lost. I have nowhere to to go. 

I have this urge to write a suicide note and just end it all. I have yet to act. I can see everything going downhill as I'm typing this post. Whatever happens, happens. I dont have the power control it. Thank you for your time."
1,"these past few nights have been rough. every night it seems that i am fighting with intrusive and suicidal thoughts.

maybe i am selfish. I want the best for me, which is to stop suffering. quickest, easiest way to achieve this death. people talk about life purpose. maybe my purpose is to show people what happens when you dont treat men like humans and partially flay their genitals and torture them sexually as infants. then you tell them theyre crazy for being depressed about having the most sensitive part of their body mutilated. i think its crazy that male human infants are the only mammal on earth whose genitals require immediate surgical correction after birth. i have been screaming for years, nobody seems to listen, nobody seems to care. the reason is because i am a male. i am not allowed to have emotions. i am not allowed to cry. anything that falls outside of strong, and stoic, is not accepted.

well, fuck you too society. i will not miss you. my chest hurts with an anger and a pain that yearns to be stopped through suicide. congrats society, you have created another statistic, adding to the 80% of male executed suicides.

my only questions are,

do i make it look like an accident so those who know me are less hurt?

OR

do i make it very clear that this was intentional and allow my pain to be felt and understood? <--(funny how people dont care to do this until you are gone)"

1,A wave is hitting me real hard right now. Everything just feels hopeless. I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone and I feel like I don’t deserve anything. The usual shit blah blah you get it. Why does my mind have to fucking be like this
1,"I feel like I shouldn't be like this because I'm too young. 13yr old male(14 in legit 11 days) and I just feel like it doesn't make sense for me to be having all these thoughts and problems. I cut myself a lot sometimes daily, drink, have suicidal thoughts, little to no energy all the time, have trouble in school and socializing, and my home life I don't know if it's abusive or not but it definitely isn't good.  My friend once said after I made a suicide joke ""ew you legit sound like a 14yr old girl"" and I've just been thinking a lot about how maybe I'm not depressed and just an overreacting or attention seeking teen. I feel like all my friends hate me and I'm just annoying to them. I'm scared if failure and stress everyday about what I'm going to do for my future and how I'm going to make it. My parents divorced when I was 9 and both of them got cancer around the same time leaving me pretty much free at both houses because my 5 siblings either just never talked to me or were at collage and my grades started improving and I made some online friends because I didn't realize how much my parents try to control me and push their views onto me until now. I also realized neither of them give a shit about me as a person but just want me to be there so there and do everything for them. I don't like venting to my friends because I just feel like I'm annoying them but sometimes when I hit a low I do so anyway and when I come out of it I just feel really bad for venting to them. I've tried suicide twice by hanging myself but both times the object I was using to hang myself from the ceiling broke or felldown. There's a lot more problems I could talk forever about but I don't feel like my problems are bad enough for me to be feeling suicidal and I feel like I'm too young to be thinking life is hopeless and to be having frequent breakdowns.

To sum up: I'm very depressed and self harm and drink and that stuff but feel like I shouldn't be having these thoughts because of how young I am and feel like my life hasn't been bad enough for me to feel this way

Sorry for any spelling or Grammer errors and I hope everyone reading this and on the sub has the strength to get through another day I believe in you all!!"
1,"I somehow found a way to feel good while feeling real bad at the same time. Was on the verge of the chasm of mental breakdown but someone told me some real good news and it doesn't really feel good per se, but rather like falling with style into an I'm not okay anymore, and i know the good part of this won't last long, and I, after so many years, still don't know what to do about it."
1,"I feel like nobody cares. This is my first post to reddit, and honestly I haven't read much on here either before now. I just kind of need to talk.

My relationship with my father has been horrible for most of my life, but recently it's gotten worse to the point that I don't even try to connect with him or talk to him at all if I don't have to. Even that is too much of a bother to him, though; a few days ago I overheard him complaining to my stepmom that I keep talking to him, saying that I'm annoying and am always trying to get his attention and interrupt his games, and telling her how disrespectful it is that I talk while he has headphones on (for the record, all I say is ""Hey, Dad!"").

You know what I dared inconvenience him with?

I was taking the dog for a walk since she hadn't been out all morning, and he had her in his office.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There are days on end where we don't talk at all, and I bother him too much?! It's completely ridiculous. I can't believe I was stupid enough to move back in here, but now I can't leave because the rent went up too much for him to pay on his own when he moved, and my stepmother and brother can't make up the difference, and even if I knew they were okay, I have no money saved up and I barely make enough to even afford to rent a room somewhere.

This is something I've been dealing with all my life, from him, my mom, and my stepmom (although she's genuinely changed and we're on good terms now, as a child she was my worst nightmare). I have trouble making or keeping friendships because I feel like nobody wants me around or really cares. I don't know what to do to fix my life. I have no real friends, I have a job that I don't feel like I'm good at or can succeed in, and I'm in an environment that is horrible for my mental health but that I can't afford to leave. Part of me wants to just walk out, stay in a shelter and figure out the rest from there."
1,"sometimes this subreddit is like joining the hundreds of others screaming into the void.. yeah. idk. everyone is depressed. everyone is screaming. people want a positive change they can look forward to. yet universe is silent. life feels meaningless and especially cruel, how we are given shitty circumstances with no blueprint out.

should i make my death look like an accident? or clearly show that it was purposeful? 

my chest is tightening with pain. i will need more drugs to appear emotionally normal for work tomorrow. haha yes society i am not a crumbling ball of suicidal thoughts and depression lol"
1,Admitting. I haven't wanted to admit how low I've been. I've been trying to cover everything up. But I'm drowning. Listening to Mac Miller's 'Good News' an amazing song that somehow encompasses how I feel. I feel broken and I'm trying to figure out how the hell to get up. I feel so alone. I don't know how to start over. Not right now.
1,"I have no one.. Title explains it all. I have no good friends. I have people who love me, but i cant talk to them about how I feel, and when i try they brush it off as ""moody"" because im a teenager. I settle for less and I know i shouldnt but its not like theres anything ahead of me. I once trusted someone and told them I was about to kill myself. They called the cops (which I am extremely grateful for) and the cops questioned me, asking if i had a plan, etc. I just said what they wanted to hear, what my parents wanted to hear. I cant goto therapy because of the cost and i dont have anyone to talk to. So im here, ranting. I dont want anyone on here to ask if i wanna PM or whatever. No offense to you guys but i have trust issues, the only reason I can post this is because its not direct. I hate confrontation. So yea.... I just needed to write something out."
1,"Every day for the past 3 years!!!!. I went prison at the age of 18 for 18 months for something I got tangled up in but was innocent of but that’s not even the reason for me constantly feeling down. It’s my older brother passing away when I was 16. I feel like life/society hasn’t been fair to me. I don’t want to call it depression to have respect for those are actually have clinical depression but for the past 3 years, I cannot remember a day when I haven’t contemplated suicide. 

I have checked websites for advice but to be frank, they don’t sway or benefit me. Any advice? What should I do?"
1,"Use to have hope now I don’t. I’m I 26 year old female and have been battling anxiety and depression for 10 years now. I didn’t really have a good high school life. Don’t have any friends, I have a few friends in and out of my life. Have only kissed 2 guys in my life once 19 and the other time 25 I was extremely drunk only had sex once and never been in a relationship. I paced around my room from 12-25 listening to music with my headphones on, still do it sometimes but not a lot. And don’t know why I can’t make connections with anyone. And the worst is not only that I haven’t been in a relationship with anyone I find out that a guy I like likes me back but I’m to scared to open up to him and maybe see if anything will happen between us. I think I’m pretty much set on just being single for the rest of my life. I quit everything I do I have no motivation, I’m pretty much scared of everything I feel like I’m mentally disabled. I love make up and went to cosmetology school but never did anything with that I feel bad for having my parents pay all that money and I never did anything I still work at my families restaurant I can’t be a waitress cause I backed out of that last minute cause of anxiety.
I had such hope for my life and wanted to get off this track I was on for so long now I’m just done. 
What are people thoughts, should I just stay on this track and be happy, I mean we all live different lives"
1,"I just need to vent somewhere, i don't expect you to read or anything.. I'm hanging by a thread, I'm so close to killing myself, it's the only option now. The question I always ask myself is when to do it. I feel trapped on this Earth and I'm tired of living for others or just living in general. I don't belong on this Earth in this society with these people, no one would give a shit all that much if I died anyway besides my dad. Cry for 1 hour then get over it and get on with your lives. I'm glad it is that way, its less people to hurt when I'm gone. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because it would kill my dad. I'm so sick and tired of him, he doesn't understand mental illness at all. Apparently Major Depressive Disorder doesn't exist unless he saw it on a TV commercial. I'm tired of him constantly getting on my case about everything. I am never right, ever, I don't understand, there's something about me that makes me an easy target for people to always try to backhand things I say or make a joke at my expense, I can only laugh it off so many times. I've just been holding everything inside for so long, its too late for me to let it out in a healthy way, every time I feel like I wanna stand up for myself now I just want to scream at them or get violent, lose control somehow. Don't ever underestimate someone who doesn't give a shit about anything anymore or has nothing to lose, because I feel like if I lost it some day on someone I wouldn't stop. I might as well kill myself, I have no future, I'm gonna be alone the rest of my life, if pain is the only thing I have look forward to for the rest of my life then what is the point. I'm too far gone and too old to matter to anyone now, whether it be friendship or relationship. There are so many other better people out there, I don't blame people for not being interested in me. I'm not worth anything. People say ooohh your such a kind hearted person why wouldn't a girl wanna pass that up? Shut the fuck up, please just shut the fuck up. You might as well tell me I'm worthless if thats all you have to say about me. that's not what people look for, and I'm not mad at them or blame them for it. I have no worth, even if I got better it would be too late. I'm so tired of the pounding and pain in the pit of my stomach. I wish everyone would let me die, getting out doesn't help, hobbies don't distract me anymore. All of my interests are pretty much gone now. There is no reason to live no reason to live at all I don't dven ent to get better  anymore if it means absolutely nothing to sh now  for it besides more pain please someone just kill me I will pay them to shoot me I don't wan to live anymore thinking about all of this is just making nr fell worse fuxk it I hate everything goojbdy"
1,"Anxiety and depression won't allow me to sleep anymore. Woke up at 4am to my 18 month old daughter crying because she lost her pacifier. Husband was next to me asleep like usual. He never hears her cry at night. I soothe her, go back to bed. Can't sleep. This has been my life for the last few months. I am exhausted but can't sleep. During the day I can barely keep my eyes open. During the day I am working from home like  most people are during this pandemic. When I try to take a nap, there is too much noise going on so can't really get a solid nap in either if I do fall asleep. 

On top of that, I have several things I have been dealing with: 

\- I have depression for which I take antidepressants. These antidepressants give me the side effect of dilating one pupil more than the other and causes me headaches. I wear glasses to help combat the headache. I can't really stop taking the antidepressants cause you should never go cold turkey on them. 

\- I've also been having a thyroid issue. It's enlarged and will need to be partly removed in June (hopefully, if it doesn't get canceled due to Corona). I've been feeling like I'm going through menopause: Sweating, hot flashes, emotional, ... I'm 28 years old ... 

\- Got scoliosis and kyphosis. Used to go to the chiropractor for treatment but since the pandemic I can't and I've been having muscle spasms and pretty bad back pain. 

\- My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer spread to the liver and peritoneum. She got her 5th chemo a week ago. She's doing well but we're currently not speaking of her being cured or being able to have the operation to remove the ovaries and cancer. 

\- My husband has PTSD (Army veteran) and has depression. Takes antidepressants as well as I do. No side effects luckily but he's usually quite negative, easily discouraged and likes to game all day every day if I let him. He moved to my country with me and the daughter for a better life and his integration program has been postponed due to Corona. He's not happy having to wait, he wants to work so bad. 

This pandemic has me worried. I am always super careful, keep my distance, wear gloves, wear a mask, wash my hands when I come in and use handsanitizer, immediately shower right after coming back and then I allow myself to go say hi to my mom and my daughter (we all live in the same household btw). I am terrified ... What if I picked up the virus but don't know, what if I give it to my mom with stage 4 cancer, what if I give it to my daughter or my husband. I don't know if my mom would survive it in her condition ... So much anxiety ... 

I would love to hear some tips and tricks on how to be able to get some sleep and calm myself down enough so I don't go absolutely insane. 2020 has been awful so far and I am expecting to see the 4 horsemen and Cthulhu this year at this point. Thank you guys for reading!

TLDR: 28 year old with depression, antidepressants causing pupil issues and headaches, thyroid issues, scoliosis and kyphosis, my mom with stage 4 cancer, an 18 month old and an immigrant stay-at-home husband with PTSD would like some advice on how to be able to finally get some well needed sleep!"
1,I’m a Loser.. I feel like a Loser like Beck says. Anyone else feeling like that way right now?
1,"I feel extremely alone.. For years now I have had to deal with this numbness/sorrow, on rare occasions I will be happy about something but it’s always temporary. Outside of this whole quarantine situation, I’m usually surrounded by people my age and they always seem so joyful or they have something to look forward to. I understand that depression is something a lot of people deal with, especially a lot of people my age, and that it’s not something many open up about either, but in this case I feel like I have yet to meet someone who has the same outlook or feels the same as me. I don’t feel much towards anything anymore. Everyone appears to be excited about something. I haven’t felt that way about anything in forever and as much as I try to, I can’t. As much as these same people say they understand, I don’t think they really do. I’ve always had this sort of “alone” feeling, but now it’s worse than ever."
1,"I need advice.. My life is going pretty bad. I lost all my friends and I’m about to lose my bf who is my only friend. I really hate the way I am, I’m a very horrible person and cry every night."
1,"Feeling a bit better..??. I don’t know for sure but after a long time of feeling like total shit I seem to feel a tad better today. Maybe because I finally slept well. I also got out of bed pretty easily. Strange...

SLEEP IS IMPORTANT BUT WHY IS IT SO HARD?!"
1,so completely alone. do u ever feel so alone even if ur with a bunch of people that it’s actually kinda fucking terrifying. then u want to be alone but when ur alone it’s just more lonely??or is that just me?
1,"I miss my sex drive. (20F) I've been on antidepressants for 2 years, I used to have a high sex drive and now I just really never do and it causes problems in my relationship from time to time. My boyfriend is understanding and all but I feel bad that I'm just never in the mood for anything anymore.
I don't want to stop taking my meds yet, it has made a noticeable difference and I don't think I'd be able to be where I'm at right now if I go back to before I was on them. I guess I'm just wandering if anyone has any ways to help"
1,I'm just so lonely. Not much of my life has changed since this quarantine. I have 0 friends but now since I can't go anywhere I'm just stuck at home with my toxic family with no escape. Everyone's saying how they miss their friends and can't wait to see them again. I have no one. I'll still be in my bed every weekend drowning in this pit of depression and loneliness by myself :/
1,"Depression Overtaking Anxiety??? Help. **(20 F)** so basically, I have really bad anxiety since 8th grade, mind you, I am 20 now. Some things recently happened and especially during quarantine I've just gotten worse. I'm already a homebody but having to strictly do online courses for uni and being away from literally anyone supportive is hard. I honestly don't have friends and all this time I've been spending it in the same corner of my bed, thinking. Countless nights staring at the wall, I can't sleep, etc. I don't want to admit this but at the same time I'm concerned, I've fallen into a really bad spiral. I noticed that instead of worrying about things that could happen (the anxiety part), it evolved into accepting everything bad HAS and WILL happen. I have barely been eating anything for 5 days, even if i try I really just can't, the taste is bland and makes me want to puke, so I don't eat. I try so hard but I cant get past maybe a slice of toast and yogurt. All of my life I've bitten my nails and would stress eat and now ironically, my nails are growing for the first time EVER because I don't have this oral fixation anymore which I thought was okay but I feel like I just lost any will to do anything, including my nervous habits? I know I am mentally getting worse but I am still breaking habits and it is really confusing because I understand the severity of how I am feeling but I genuinely want help, but knowing I am alone really feeding my mindset of just not giving into human necessities. I don't know what to do. I would use to wish I wouldn't eat so much and now that food grosses me out its just making me realize how shitty it all is."

I'ts like everyday I'm alone with my mind trying to keep myself busy so I don't let depression stand out from my other thoughts..."
1,Do people look at you like you are scum?. I see people always give me weird looks like im some sort of creep.
1,"DAE feel like they will never be happy. when I'm asked about my future, I always tell the plan that made me really excited and happy when I was still able to feel those emotions. but I'm trying to not think about it at all because if I do, I break down. the reason for that is because I feel absolutely numb and blank towards things. I'm trying to keep hopes up that one day I will feel good enough, watching the sun rise while drinking coffee, feeling content and calm with worries so little and so managable. yet when I try to imagine tge future I ""want"", I feel blank and empty inside. I hate it so much and it scares me. it scares me because I'm starting to think that if one day I get the future I ""want"", I will feel the same. I will look up at the pretty sky with my favourite cup of coffee and will feel helplessly empty, and that's gonna be the end of me."
1,"Can't sleep because tommorow will come faster. Everyday at night I dread going to sleep because it marks another day closer to humility. Closer to losing everything. Closer to being exposed.


 Closer to uncertainty."
1,"I feel alone.. I've suffered from depression for a long time. Me and my wife are separating, and then the coronavirus happened. We decided to get back together, but it's been seven days now and we got into a horrible fight and are separate again. I'm drinking again and the fights are horrible. I feel low real low. And I feel horrible. I can't control myself and I hurt her when i don't want to. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place, but I don't feel my best. I have a video chat with my therapist tomorrow, but I havent felt good. Not in a long time. I can barely work or focus on anything, and I latch onto anything to do that will make me feel better. I even spent 200 dollars on a charcuterie board during one of my moods the other day. I dont know why, because it gave me something to do. I dont want anyone to talk to. I dont even know what I would say. I just want to vent. Like I said I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. But I dont feel good right now."
1,"Breakup with other half. Now relapsed into self harm. Dont think i can live anymore. What is there to live for without him. Our relationship was on and off for 3 years and ill admit it is toxic. But its us. We scream and fight and then we laugh and feel closer together. Its our routine. Its not healthy, but to be honest he was the only one who was there for me consistently.

He hit me today and i hit him back. But because he cornered me and refused to let me leave i stupidly reported him to the police. Theyve arrested him and im regretting it all. I would never take him to court. I hate his guts but love him with all my soul as well. I feel so guilty that im at home in bed whilst he spends a night in a cell. We were both at wrong. 
Without him im nothing. Im worthless. I doubt he will even want to speak to me when hes released. I contacted the police and told them i dont want to press charges or proceed further. But because of protocol they have to send someone out to me in the morning so hes in there all night. 

Without him theres nothing worth living for. No morning cuddles and him comforting after my night terrors. No more late night tv sessions or kitchen dance parties. No more morning showers together or walks home in the dark. Ive relapsed and cut my arm up. I think im going to end it if he decides to go no contact. There is no way i can survive this lockdown without him there. All this pain because i decided i couldnt put up with his bullshit. Why couldnt i just deal with the abuse for fucks sake. Its what i deserve. When i think forward into the future i genuinely do not see myself alive without him."
1,"Am I falling back in?. So it’s been a long while since I’ve had time with my own thoughts, but now obviously I have more time than I know what to do with. Someone could argue _too_ much time. I know it’s cliché, “this too shall pass, it’s normal to feel sad/anxious right now,” but I was really _really_ looking forward to getting my life on track this year. I finally started saving up to move into my own place, finally looking for a career, finally about to actually graduate instead of walking on a stage. 

Instead, now I’m staying at home wondering when I’ll ever be able to see another face again. I’m stuck worrying if my parents are going to be okay not just financially but also health wise. I say I’m going to keep reading, learning how to code, yatta yatta... but it all just bores me now after a few minutes. I sit at home, maybe go for a run if I’m feeling really shitty, but for the most part i skip meals and lose sleep every night (hence my 4am post). I haven’t showered in days.. My mood changes constantly from irritated one minute, to crying in my sheets the next, then suddenly I’m back on my Netflix binge like it never even happened. I’m also quick to have a glass of wine (or 4), or maybe I’ll go to the gas station and buy yet another vape stick flavored just like mint even though the last time I bought one was “definitely the last time,” or maybe I’ll just keep smoking weed and just numb my emotions for another day longer. I can’t seem to shake it anymore. I don’t know why I’m like this. 

I’ve suffered too long from anxiety, I don’t want to fall back into these same patterns. I want to be better but I just can’t help but think of all the shit going wrong. Am I ever going to get my job back? Will my family be okay? My grandmother just got out of the hospital and is back to living by herself how is she doing? Will I ever get my unemployment benefits? Will society go back to normal, even after this is over? Why am I still thinking about my ex who I know is an asshole and dumped me over 6 months ago? Why am I thinking about how the only people I’ve ever been romantically attracted to, always turn out wrong? Maybe I’m not meant to find love. Maybe I’m not meant to live the life I’ve wanted to. Maybe things would be better if it all ended. What’s the point in waking up tomorrow just to do it all over again? I guess my birthday is coming up this week.. but is that even something I can look forward to in a time like this? Sorry for the long post here, I may have rambled a little, I just really wanted to get my thoughts and concerns out there. Because I feel like I’m fucking spiraling."
1,"i feel like no one will ever love me romantically. I told my crush that I liked her and she told me she didn't have the capacity to feel anything for anyone at the moment, the next week I heard from a mutual friend that she's on a date with someone else. Then we (the crush and I) met up with some friend to go downtown and she was there with her date and they were doing pda in front of me and she acted as if she was oblivious to what she told me about her not being able to have feelings for anyone. Do I have the right to feel sad? because I feel like i'm over reacting. I'm not sad about her having a date, i'm sad about her lying to me because we are friends after all and friends are supposed to be honest with each other, right?"
1,"I want to be great. Ever since I was a little kid I’ve always wanted to play in the NFL and having played football my whole life made me think maybe I would really accomplish my goal. I guess life had different plans for me because one injury ended my career and got rid of my scholarship and future. So one year after the day I was injured I’m thinking why do I have such a longing for greatness if there’s only one thing I’ve ever been good at and it’s just suddenly been ripped away from me. I’m at a stalemate with life, if football wasn’t what I was meant to be great at then what, I’ve never had any other passions or dreams. Does everyone feel this way, the longing to work as hard as you can just to feel like you accomplished something in life. I don’t know what’s next in my life and truly that is one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever had. To not know wether or not my life will be worth nothing to me when it does end. Or will I have achieved my internal feeling of want and longing. I don’t know what to do or what to pursue anymore but this feeling is eating me up inside and I just want to get rid of it..."

1,"Sorry for keeping this short, but... I'm feeling lonely, numb, and exhausted both mentally & physically with some flashbacks that have been haunting me for almost two years now. I should be over it by now but I'm not. 
I lost all of my online friends but that's probably my fault since I'm very shy, reserved and I find it difficult to maintain friendships..
I guess that's all I have to say"
1,"The Worst Part. The Worst Part

Confusion time:

The worst part about my depression is that I have no reason to be depressed, and the fact that I’m depressed may be a feeling that I am giving to myself and I am the reason I am depressed. However, that, in itself, is a symptom of depression. Fun.

This isolation is really not fun, but it beats having to live."
1,When living to old age and dying from natural causes. At this point living to old age and dying a natural death feels like an “achievement” thoughts?
1,"unsupportive parents. my mom and step-dad are very ‘opposed’ to mental health issues, especially my step-dad, who openly states that people will depression need ‘to get over it’ and it’s all attention seeking (might also add that his son tried to kill himself a couple of years ago, and so I honestly HOPE that my step-dad is just in denial). I’ve been struggling on and off for 5 years, the past 8 months being the worst it’s been since I began to struggle with depression. 

I feel absolutely fucking pathetic. I can’t even begin to describe how much self-loathing I feel at even the thought of how I feel. I hate expressing emotions and find it really hard to open up to my boyfriend for this reason. I can never seem to describe how I feel without feeling gross and I believe this is down to how my parents would react if they found out about how I’ve been struggling.

I’ve been doing online therapy for the past 3 months and it’s honestly barely helped because I can’t bring myself to use it regularly or use the helping tools. My parents aren’t aware of this - although I’ve hinted that I do therapy to my mom but she doesn’t often pay interest. I’m at a point now where I don’t even want to help myself to stop the negative impact I have on those around me - it’s beyond selfish, and I’m beyond caring. 

How I’ve felt has ruined my relationships with almost everyone in my life and I don’t know how to come back. I’m scared about how I’m going to ruin mine and other people’s lives in the long-term. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like a burden on myself and everything I do is just exhausting. I’m so tired.

apologies for the vent. I’m done now, and will most likely sheepishly delete this tomorrow.:)"
1,"I don’t know anymore. I feel like shit. I’m an ugly bastard and I cringe every time I look at a photo of myself, I can’t bear the look of my face and I bet it pains others as well. I don’t have any friends I feel a connection with, and even then I just feel like people shove me to the side. This wells up an incredible amount of anger and sadness within me that I simply don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to contain, I don’t even know how to socialize easily, or perhaps it’s the fact that people don’t want to be friends with me because of my looks. The only people I hold dear to me are my parents, who have love and kindness for me, even though I’m currently living with my brother and cousin as well. Maybe I should just disappear"
1,"My mum found my cuts. She said we’d talk later and I think she was on the brink of tears and I don’t know if she’s angry or disappointed or disgusted. I don’t know if she’ll tell my dad, I have no idea what’s going to happen now and I am kind of panicking."
1,"Being a wageslave makes me depressed. I hate working and it's killing me inside everyday. The worst is that I'm stuck working shit low paying wageslave jobs because i have no useful talents or interests for the free market out there. No matter what i try i can't seem to escape it. In a few months I will be 30 and i can't take it anymore, if my life shouldn't improve by some miracle in the next years I will kill myself."
1,I can't stop crying long enough to fall asleep. I understand that I don't deserve to ever feel okay. I never have and I never will. Sometimes I go through periods of pure apathy. I go through the motions of my day with no feeling. But sometimes I go through weeks where all I do is sob and moan. My neighbors hate me. They hear me through the walls and floors. But I can't stop.
1,"Tbh I'm tired of getting my hopes up. I'm not gonna have some magical revaluation. I'm just gonna be lonely. Lonely for being unable to confront why, and lonely because no one really cares when things get dicey with my mental health. Honestly I wish everyone said their true intentions rather than skip around them.

I wish everyone had decency to others' problems."
1,"part of me wants to start being fed through a tube.. I’m so tired all the time... I barely even have motivation to eat. it’s so hard all the time. I’ve just started eating peanut butter and drinking tea. i’m nearly sure i’m malnourished, but what’s the point? i’m not doing anything. i hate this."
1,"Today I cried so much that I didn't go for my afternoon walk, cause I was embarrassed of how swollen my eyes are.... Just one of those days, I even tried to change my mood by watching a childhood movie (the little princess) but that movie plot triggered some very bad feelings I have deep deep inside about not having a father (or mother) and being raised in a very abusive family..."
1,"I should have never taken in my cat. I can barely take care of myself. With this fucking useless unemployment line is always too busy, and fear of getting a job at a place that still operates due to the novel coronavirus, having another living breathing thing to feed, but not really knowing how that's going to happen, has been an increasing stressor on my mind. Before it wasn't a problem because feeding one cat is not expensive at all. Now I'm kind of worried about both of us.

Fuck this shit. I don't want to just rely on. Charity and the kindness of strangers, not do I want to rely on anyone else really. Life just fucking sucks. It is too fucking uncertain. There is nothing good about having to worry about your next meal. And then you have to also worry about a second living thing. I don't understand how anyone does this. How anyone would choose to have fucking children. How anyone could possibly be happy and motivated in the face of complete uncertainty. I don't want to learn how. I just need to die. But I'm too much of a fucking coward. I just want to give up. I'm fucking tired of this fucking virus. Fucking tired of worrying about accidentally killing myself or a family member by fucking bringing it home. 

In life you are just fucked if you do, fucked if you don't. There is no real safety. There is no real security. Everything is fucking shit, and I wish I had the ability to have life in me despite that fact. But I fucking don't."
1,"ehh not even sure what to say...i apologize for the randomness and stupidity of it. (figures i would try this out because im pretty much incapable of doing anything else to helpmyself)

hate to say the typical 'dead inside' stuff...but man all i ever feel is usually anger, and depression...only have 2 family members that i talk  to(cant avoid it) and its always about how horrible things are EVERYDAY yet if i tell em its getting me down...i get treated like im a horrible person for saying so, the rest is work a job with people who arnt exactly decent people(trying to word that nicer than it really is im not even exaggerating) because its the only job that almost pays all the bills, cant get another one or better because of time conflicts with what i have to do to help my grandfather, and no friends to speak of...i thought i tried to make a few but it was always just...seemed wrong to try with them, they always turned out to be just unhealthy to be around or just wanted to do stupid things like sitting around talking crap about people, or go to bars and have no responsibility for their actions(drunk driving, acting degrading to themselves and to other people, ect) not very big into religion more out of a respectful thing because my family isnt exactly on good terms with stuff like that...i think my problem is just too much tv, comics, books, movies, ect because i tend to get jealous of the fictional stuff i see, more just ways that seem like things that are kinda based on reality, ya know seeing people happy, or even the crazy stuff like hero ideals...except im stuck doing everything i think is just generally pointless, i also tend to look at the state of the world and humanity and im very worried for the future of literally everything so im down because i cant do anything to make a pointfull change for that and i dont see anything or anyone else being able to do it either...its just a daily routine of work, think about how things are(100% of the time its not good thoughts) go home listen to the same things i was thinking about all day and more to add to it, finish what im told to do and just sit around distracting myself with games, comics, and movies because its the only way i dont hear my thoughts, yet i dont want to ingore them...it just feels wrong to ignore the bad stuff becuase its like thats what i think is the worlds just causing its problems from anyway...i dont even know what im looking for lol, i guess a bit of happiness/ways to change things not for myself for the planet in general(a bit stupid but my only bit of religous thoughts are that humans should be guardians of the planet and of its history and life so that we can repay the fact that were all really just lucky how things are set on this planet...it could be so much worse... if anyones even reading this thnx lol

...i have no adrenaline...no postivity to act on so really just trying things is a hardship in general, just caught up in fantasy ideas that make normal life extreamly boring while hating how the world and humanity is turning out..just pretty much a walking puppet with anger...hoping i can find a way work with my own depressing personality 

(btw i do appreciate all suggetions but ive looked into so much it seems like i cant find an answer....also i just cant beleive in taking pills or therapy(mostly on how little money i have on that therapy thing) and the area i live in doesnt provide really anything for the type of person i am...mostly for retirees, and just...bars i guess really nothing else not that i have the time or funds for anything else than what im doing right now...srry all 1st and only post ill make about depressing stuff...dont need to make things worse on other people ya know?"
1,"What am I supposed to do when I have no one/nothing left?. I see, well talk to, my psych and my therapist tomorrow. I'm tripping balls I guess. I haven't really been sleeping. I cry pretty much every day. Everyone who's ever said they give a fuck about me left me at one point or another. Now I'm alone. Here at home from college with my abusive family. I don't see any point to anything. I don't really know what to do or say to my psych tomorrow. I don't really want to die or anything. I'd rather just bang and punch a bunch of walls till I can't feel anything and then do it again when I start feeling shit again. I'm so fucking tired of everything."
1,"I’m considering suicide again. Title says it all I guess. I just need a place to vent right now. I’m not sure how much longer I can go. I’ve already tried killing myself twice. Third time is the charm, right? I just can’t keep living like this. I’m a closeted (sorta) trans person living with an over-controlling, cyber-stalking, conservative family. They treat me like some sort of object they can do whatever they want with. When I show signs of not being some submissive pet or when then possibility rises that I’m not cis they flip out and we have yet another fight. Fight and fight and I just can’t take it. I’m sorry to burden anyone here but I just needed to vent. Kinda hoping no one sees this tbh"
1,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that no one cares about you and if you disappeared none of your friends would miss you?. I feel like I don’t matter to anyone. And if I left it wouldn’t really have an impact on them.

I don’t even think they like talking to me tbh. I think they sort of put up with me. I don’t think they’d be happy if I was gone, just that it wouldn’t have that great of an effect on them.

I think my family would care, luckily. But to everyone else, they just wouldn’t.

Edit: I’m going through a really bad depressive episode. I was diagnosed late 2017 after the worst depression I had at that point. And I already know this is gonna be worse. And I hate the fact that I’m aware of my emotions, the effects it has on me, and the levels at which this depression hits me."
1,Been battling this depression for while now and thing been good until today. I’ll been doing good with my depression until today where I just wanna to die. The irony thing I’m week out from video chatting with my therapist. I just hate my family and hate that I’m stuck with them and I wished committed suicide back went I had the chance. And it’s not like I can’t do that now but I would rather commit suicide alone . And not even like everything going is getting to me it really the people keep saying the same old shit like they can’t believe what’s going is happening and finding to blame someone for it.
1,"Anti-Depressants don’t work for me at all.. Depressed for 4 years now, diagnosed treatment resistant. I have tried every treatment there is with zero relief. What’s next?"
1,"I need to let this out. Back in 2018 and early 2019 I was extremely depressed. I've always been a loner and struggled with anxiety but those two years hit me the hardest. I thought nothing was going to better. Then a girl that I was friends with for a very long time confessed that she had feelings for me. I thought everything was finally looking up for me. We ended up dating and I didn't feel depressed anymore, I genuinely believed that I was getting better. She actually listened to me and cared for me. Then not even a year later, she breaks my heart. The way she talked to me after our breakup made it seem like she never even loved me to begin with. 

So here I am, almost a week later, and it's hitting me really hard. I miss all the good memories and being in love. I keep blaming myself for the breakup and I don't know why. I only have one friend, and she is trying her best to make me feel better. But I'm honestly crushed and I feel more depressed than I was before I got in a relationship with my ex. I truly believe I'm meant to be alone forever because there is no way I'll ever have another girlfriend. Everyone just leaves me anyways.

Sometimes I just wish I would've just ended everything back in 2018 like I wanted to."
1,"Too depressed to do anything. I know this sounds stupid, but I am having to change my life routines due to the fact that I can't bring myself to do stuff. Even the basics like bathing are becoming difficult for me. I have official paperwork to do that seems to have just disappeared into the ether. I am having a hard time eating, doing laundry and putting things away. Too anxious to walk outside. Nothing interests me. Ive tried reading, Ive tried using internet sites to be entertained, Ive tried watching movies or tv to pass time. Talking to people is exhausting. It all just seems mindless and difficult. It feels defeating that everything feels this way. All I can bring myself to do is get through work. At this point I've considered that I hardly buy any food because it goes bad. I don't buy things that need to be cooked. I can't eat unless I'm super hungry and once I eat a little then I just am not motivated to eat more. Food also makes a mess that then becomes a problem of cleaning up. The thing is it is all an excuse to be lazy so I convince myself to roll with the punches and just be ok with this and adapt to this because otherwise I'd just be complaining. The company of others feels robotic. I feel like my conscience is going into illness and slowly withering away while my body tries to stay afloat. I know I will survive this but I do feel like a dirty pathetic human even though I know I am ambitious and have a lot to look forward to. I forget to drink water. I dont feel like drinking water."
1,I Hate Myself. i really hate myself like really really hate myself. i wish i could kill myself but i can't because i'm the most spineless person alive. i hate myself
1,"Day by day. This is the only way I can live, past few years have been rough, and just keep getting worse. People say look for the light at the end of the tunnel , but that’s hard to do when you care about everyone else and they never care about what happens to you."
1,"I don't get it.. I just don't fucking get it.

I feel better, I start making music on a free DAW I found. I post them on a twitter account and then tweet on my main about it, only to find out that no one fucking cares. No one.
The views I have are from my therapist and my cousin.

This is exactly the type of shit that makes me wonder if anyone cares at all. Friends say they care about you and then when the time comes, nothing. I don't get what was wrong that made them ignore the tweet.

This is the type of shit that makes me go to bed amd lay there all day."
1,"I want to end it so bad nowadays. This is just a rant, I need to really get all of this off my shoulder a bit. Any help would be appreciated :)

These past few weeks in quarantine have helped me relax and not have to constantly worry about school, but I had no friends in school anyways so I have no body to talk to or play games with. I'm always so lonely, bored, empty and sad, but I don't want quarantine to end because then school will start again and then I'll start getting even more depressed and get panic attacks once again. Anxiety is already rampant when I'm trying to sleep (racing heart, chest pain, sleep apnea,) this all happens every single night when i'm trying to fall asleep.

I'm also always super self conscious because i've been told that i'm ugly and stupid by everybody i've ever know in my life. Now I have to always hide my face and can't even look at people in the eyes in case they look at my face. Doing any activity is also challenging because I lack any motivation. I keep missing multiple online assignments from school. I always keep judging myself for anything i do, there's always a voice at the back of my mind telling me that i'm worthless, ugly, stupid, talentless, that I should just kill my self and end the suffering, and I really want to.

All i would really want right now is someone to hug me and let me tell them about everything, my parents are mega religious so they always just pray for me, and since i'm atheist it does nothing to help me."
1,"I'm trying to get better but I still feel like I'm suffocating. Quarantine has been an enlightening experience. I'm trapped in my home with little to do other than course work and it leaves me often alone with my own mind. Trying to hide my struggles from people around me is getting old. I want to act happy and I want to act like every day is a good day, that whenever I talk to my S.O, I'm happy, when I'm with friends, I'm happy. 

I can't help it. I feel like such a burden. I feel like no matter what I do, I will always be the source of someone's anger or sadness. 

I feel it everyday. I feel myself slipping back into the hole I've been desperately trying to crawl out of and I don't know what to do. I feel a gaping hole in my chest and it all hurts. All of this is a pointless fucking ramble that I'll probably freak out about and delete again later. 

Why is depression so damn hard? I don't even know if I want to get better anymore. I know recovery isn't linear in any way shape or form, but the crashes are just too much. I rather stay this way than have hope again. Fuck, it all hurts so much and I'm suffocating.

Thank you for listening."
1,"Feeling Gloomy. I'm having a bout of depression, just needed a place to put it besides my journal. Some friends told me I can tell them anything anytime, but right now I don't want to word-vomit my mood to them too much. Nobody needs to respond. I can't put into words how hollow and lonely I am at this moment; I know I won't feel it as strongly when I wake up, which is somewhat a silver lining.

If you too are having a dark night of the soul, you aren't alone. I'm not alone. I just feel alone. As if a pane of glass stands between me and everyone in the world. I want so badly to reach out and connect. It's as if my humanity's slipped away. 

Thanks for letting me stamp my mind onto a board for the night. I know many of you are struggling. Hang in there"
1,"I just want it to stop. I feel so worthless, so bad. I just want to be fucking happy. I want to stop crying and I want it to stop hurting. Because everything hurts and I feel like it'll never stop and I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do."
1,I don’t feel like doing anything.. I don’t feel like exercising. I don’t feel like going for a walk. I don’t feel like writing a rap because I’m depressed. Idk how to do something when I don’t feel like it like it like I feel lethargic.
1,"I'm too tired of this. I'm a guy, I already want to die and I will do it soon, iv been so deppresed since I was 13 because of a very traumatic experience I went through, I was raped, and I even tried to kill myself already at 15, I basicly mixed and swallowed a tons of pills, and for some reason all it did was make me sick for a few days, that was it

I'm 18 now and i have really tried to keep it under control and I feel far worse, I don't see myself living past 19, life for me it's completely unbearable."
1,"i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t like opening up to people because i’m so scared of coming off as whiney or something, and i’ve been bottling up everything for so long and idk who to reach out to anymore so here i am ig haha ! so basically nothing feels real. i don’t think im experiencing derealization (maybe?idk tbh) but forever i’ve felt so disconnected and so distant from everyone. not like, oh i’m so different and quirky no one understands me hehe, but like no one in my life feels like they fuxking exist. i feel like this won’t ever change, i’m waiting for something good to happen but i think and i don’t even know what i’m waiting for. suicide used to seem so selfish, but at this point i feel like i have nothing to lose. my friends are so distant, my family is so distant, but i know that if i ever killed myself i cant imagine doing that to my sister, but at the same time it’s like my brains convinced me that nothing is real anyways or i shouldn’t even give a fuck because everyone dies at some point. i’ve never even told anyone how absolutely disgusted i am at my appearance, specifically my face and “acne” which i know isn’t bad but at the same time i can’t even look at my face without dimming the light a little bit taking off my glasses or crying a little and it’s become such a big insecurity and it won’t go away. ive tried reaching out to friends and my mom but it makes me feel so much worse knowing that even those people can’t make me feel any better. i’m so tired im so so tired of literally just fucking existing, and i mean everyone can relate to that ha but, i don’t want to wake up tomorrow. i just want to be finally happy and feel good and feel “there” ig. but it’s like i keep spiraling into a bigger mess i just don’t know what to do anymore. anyways haha any fun tips ?"
1,How are you coping these days?. How are y’all doing? Any tips or tricks for dealing with depression in self-isolation?
1,For the first time in 3 months I have sheets on my bed.. I cant even begin to explain how hard this was for me to do. I feel good.
1,"I am running out of options.. I just learned via reddit that going back to school to get a degree in history is a bad idea. I was hoping to become a museum curator but it looks like it is near impossible even with a degree. After graduating with an art degree I spent 10 years trying to get my career going with no success. Now at 36 I was going to go back to school but now I realize that all of the good jobs out there are stem jobs which I suck at.

I graduated from college in 2008 when the recession hit and now in 2020 we are seeing another recession just as I'm trying to get back on my feet. I've been sucking down alcohol for the last 2 hours and now my only wish is that God takes me out of this hell we call life."
1,"my weight loss, and other things. so I'm losing weight. it feels good. I'm going to have a flat stomach before the summer if I keep this up. unfortunately I can't go to the gym but I ran today and only ate one very small meal. I can't wait to finally see myself in the mirror and view myself as someone conventionally attractive. I deserve it. and honestly I can't wait to use that attractiveness to get ahead in the world, for people to finally look up to me the way I deserve to be. in anything you do, it's half about how you do it and half about how bad the people watching you want to fuck you. that's just the way of the world. I feel like i could do so much more with myself if I would just get up to normal people standards. right now I'm ugly, I'm brash, I'm awkward, I'm unconfident and my voice is weak. I'm squishy and fat and these things I can change about myself. I am changing them about myself.

this year so far I've learned what capacity I have for handling bullshit. I don't tolerate it anymore. I don't tolerate being manipulated. I don't tolerate people who cross my boundaries and act like they know better than me what's best for me. I've been abused my whole life into listening to other people's opinions and needing their attention and validation to keep me wrapped around their bony little fucking fingers. in truth I don't really need much socially. I don't know why I had so many problems being lonely when nobody ever made me feel good in the first place. everyone's shallow and everyone's a liar and I've been too naive to expect more from anyone, but it's not their fault. I would hate me too. I do hate me... but not for long. not for long, world. I'm gonna be on top of this shit show and nobody's going to fucking stop me. I'm a sociopath, through and through, and I'm damn proud of it."
1,"I Feel Guilty and He's Stuck in My Head. I was in a shitty relationship last year with someone  that was on and off with me a couple of years before. I don't know why I was even in a relationship with him again in the first place after all the different times he left me for someone else. I guess it's because people like him find insecure people like me and just plant themselves in our heads. 
I have worked at the same place for over three years and over time got to know a guy there. I never (tried) to think anything of him to begin with, but I think people knew I felt something for him anyways. I'm not very good at hiding my bashfulness. He seemed to be everything I wanted out of a person.
Things were not going well in the relationship I was in. I was duped yet again, he wasn't going to change. He said he got a coworker's number just to see if he still had game, quit the job I got him, constantly belittled me in his ""subtle"" ways. I was fully convinced I was going to commit to breaking up with him. I wanted to talk to the coworker so badly that night, and my alcoholism helped out with that. Called him, told him how I felt and that I was going to dump the ex the next morning. 
But I didn't. That's most definitely where the conversation began but he threw a tantrum and ""tried"" leaving without his stuff. In hindsight I see I was being manipulated but when I tried to calm him down and he started bawling about how he wanted to marry me, I felt horrible and like I was about to throw away everything for someone I've never been with. Who might just leave me high and dry after a hookup. I let my insecurities be fed and stayed with ex for a little konger. I told my coworker after work the next day.... he didn't seem upset, he gave me a hug and told me he understood. But then he seemed.... different. 
I broke up with ex for good after I found out something disgusting he said to my sister and how he stole another sister's ear pods. Hurting my sisters drew the line for me.
And I went to the coworker, he just wanted to stay friends and he would hang out with me and my friends for the next few months occassionally. A few months ago we were still texting sometimes and joking around. But, knowing I hurt him still haunts me. I've never done anything like that before and it was the shittiest thing I'd ever done to the person I didn't know I was going to hurt. I still cry about it and feel selfish for hoping he'll forgive me someday and want to try again. I try to escape thinking about him but I can't. I've got other shit going on in my life too but this feels like the biggest weight."
1,"I need help. I am a 17 yr old male living under a mother who verbally and physically abuses me (I was diagnosed with depression earlier this year, and take Lexapro for it). Nothing insane that leaves scars or bruises, but she is constantly calling me retarded, slow, weak, and pushes me around. When I try to call people, my father, or the police, she says she will pull me from my school and that my life will be over- she also threatens to kick me out of the house. For context- I cannot go live with my father, I am stuck with her and I don't know what to do. I have contemplated suicide multiple times, and when I told her she told me to ""do it"". She has refused to give me dinner and I dont know what to do- she has cut off my credit card and locked me in my room- it is because I asked her why she stole money from my father's child support (which she uses for herself, and not me or my little brother) and did not put it into a trust for us. Please, if you're out there- help me."
1,"Everything feels like a roller coaster. Background: I’m a 14 year old freshmen. I’m doing great on my online learning, everything completed to perfection and turned in on time but I feel empty. This quarantine has been really rough for me mentally. I feel like I’m wasting away. I feel so insecure about my weight and I want to do something about it but I constantly think I’m being judged by everyone so I skip. I can’t even fast right; I wanted to fast so I could lose weight, 1 hour later I was having a second portion of dinner. The thing that depresses me the most is my gaming addiction, I’ll spend 8 hours a day on it, only a couple of nights ago did I play until 12 and it was soul crushing, I had friends with me but I felt like I’m wasting away my youth. All I do is sit inside all day either watching anime, playing video games, or sitting in my room thinking of bad things are. My biggest fears haven’t even came yet. My biggest fear is summer, I live near a public pool and I love going swimming, until recently, my body image issues have gotten so bad I don’t even want to go swimming. How can I compete in looking passable when I’m swimming with friends who are athletes. This concludes my 1 am rant about how My life seems terrible but really isn’t."
1,"Uncertain about ""friends"". I don't really know the friends I have, or if I can even consider them that in the first place. They all live in time zones hours ahead of mine, and I've never seen them in person. One of them, I happen to have a crush on. They reply really sparsely, yet they're always apologising for just that. I don't know if they're just putting up with me for the hell of it. Maybe because they feel sorry for me? I've always been frightened that I'm uninteresting, and even when it seems like I'm having a good conversation, I can't help but wonder if they care at all.

This always affects my ability to focus properly, I'm always tired and it hurts me mentally. There's a balcony just outside the front door, and it fuels my thoughts of suicide. I berate myself, while actually visualising jumping off, but I know I could never commit suicide. I'm absolutely too scared to do it (my fear of heights sure helps), and the pain it'd bring my family would be horrible.

I want some kinda help, but not medication, and not a therapist. Yes, I know that my problems are menial, and I don't have the worst depression out there. There are people here who have it much worse than I do, and believe me, I support them all the way, but I can't help but feel as if I am worthless."
1,Losing control.. There have been 2 instances within the last 7 days of my dark mind taking over my body and ordering me to use a towel like a damn noose and strangle myself with it. The second instance was earlier tonight. I collapsed and almost passed out. My life is agony.
1,"Maybe I am not good enough (rant ig). I dont rly know how to start this so ig ill just get into it but i... genuinely feel like i'm not good enough for people and that i'm lacking, especially for my boyfriend
He reassures me time and time again that i am good enough and that i treat him rly well and nicely but i feel like he's only saying that to try and appease me and that if we lived together he'd see how shitty and useless i am and will want to leave and will regret ever loving me and wasting time on me (we're in a ldr)

I feel stupid and useless, i doubt i can get a job so i'm worried about us living together and me just being a burden which makes me believe that i would need to eat less or not at all and try not to use too much electricity or water so that the bills wont be too high

Even now at home, majority of my family (save for my sister in law) all work from home and are contributing something but i'm not doing anything at all so i feel bad and like i'm leeching off of them
So i try not to eat too much so we can save on food and water (drink, not shower) because of the pandemic going on also

I don't rly have anyone to talk to this about and even if i want to talk about smth to my psych i can't because i Physically and Emotionally cannot ever appear to be Not okay if im seeing someone in person or if i know this person already
Like if i even try to try to talk about my feelings or vent out to a friend or even to her (psych) i'll feel super guilty for it and like i'm a brat
I have wanted to talk to her abt more serious things but i just Can't and end up talking about other things that don't impact me as much as the Big Things i want to talk about

Idk, ig i just wanted to vent out here so i dont really expect anyone to reply to this but if you read the whole thing, thank you for your time"
1,"I've lost my identity. I was clinically depressed for over two years. Now, after intensive therapy and a long rollercoaster, I'm moving out/have finally moved out of clinical diagnosis. My therapy sessions are spreading out more and I'm on the verge of no longer needing them anymore. I haven't seriously thought about hurting myself in a long time. I don't know who I am without this though.

My therapist and I have been talking about this the last few sessions; I need to find an identity that doesn't revolve around me being depressed. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to not center my being around me being broken. I don't feel broken anymore but I feel lost. Who do I even talk to about this? Isn't talking about it playing into the problem? Isn't me asking my friends or my family ""who am I without my depression"" making it about my depression? How do I let my loved ones know that I'm scared and lost without also making it feel like something is wrong with me? I know that I'm not any less because of my depression. I know that I'm not broken because of it. But that's all I know. And I need to know more."
1,"Been having a rough week. So I thought it would be good to get on here and spread some genuine love and concern. I hope you're doing alright. I hope that you find the energy to do something that will make you feel better; whether that's something as small as washing your face or brushing your teeth. I hope you know that you're not alone - that we're all fighting this terrible thing together. I'm sorry if you're feeling less than, or if life has turned unbearable or if it always has been. I hope you find a split-second of genuine peace or happiness today."
1,"I feel wanting to die every single is worse than actually dying. I wish I was an orphan so no one would care if I end my life. It sucks having to hang in there just to not hurt your family. I know I failed them I deserve to die but they don't deserve to suffer. I'm a complete waste of resources and oxygen. Years of miserable life with no end in sight to it.  I'm overwhelmed, there's a lot going on in my mind right now but I'm not able to let it all out. All I want now is to experience what it feels like to live with peace of mind for a single day. A mind that's not constantly at a never ending, losing battle."
1,Idk. Idk why I’m here. I think I’m depressed but idk. I just feel so lonely like every day. And have felt like this for many years. Friends are starting to be more distant. I have never had true love or even anything close to it. And I barely have any family. I don’t know what to do. I have almost stopped caring about anything. This corona shit isn’t helping my situation either. Idk what to expect from this reddit. Just wanted to get this off my chest cause nobody close to me knows what I’ve been going through.
1,"anyone else fell super down after facetiming/hanging out with friends?. i don’t know if it’s because i do my best to stay as happy as possible, or if i prefer to be with other people to stay away from my thoughts, but after my friends leave a call or an outing, i just get this feeling in my chest. like the huge weight that was gone temporarily is back. it feels horrible and it just makes everything worse. im all alone with my the brain that tries to ruin my life everyday. no distractions. it’s awful."
1,"Having a family that doesn't love you sucks.. I (16m) who is adpoted don't think I have seen any signs of love or affection toward me from my adopters. No hugs or kisses or smiles. They provide for me and don't abuse me, but other than that they are just there. My ""dad"" drinks a lot and my ""mom"" is always out with her friends. I had really good friends that made me feel good but literally at the same time they all became obsessed with drugs like 2 years ago and won't talk to me anymore. I don't know if I have any cousins or siblings to talk to. Idk what to do this makes me really depressed. I feel like I have no one to talk to and will never get a hug or feel like someone loves me."
1,"Is becoming a therapist even worth it. I am going to kill myself eventually, I feel I'm destined for it. I guess all I can do now is occupy the time before I snap, and I was going to do that by pursuing psychology which is the only subject I'm remotely interested in. But to get anywhere I'll need a whole PhD, and when I get there what am I going to do? Lie to people like me who realize medicine and therapy don't work for everyone and tell them it will get better if they keep trying? Why should I even bother getting all that education when Ill just get in debt and kill myself anyway? Why should I work at a firm that's just gonna suck 45 dollars from strugglong patients just to see *me* every session? Why should I be pretending to help people to make myself feel like I'm maybe not a waste of space for 20 minutes? How much incorrect advice will I give? How many of my patients will kill themselves because I failed? I love psychology. I want to help people so bad. I just realistically think it won't make any difference or be worth it. For every patient I help, that'll get erased by the 1 I fail to help. This is the wrong attitude for this field, I know, but I am too lazy and stupid to do anything else- this is already a step down from a harder degree I was going to pursue. I wish I would just die in a car accident and not have to do anything ever again."
1,"I put my life on hold. I had decided I was done with coasting. I don't enjoy forcing myself to work on my creative endeavors. I want to enjoy them. And those endeavors are really the only thing left I can think of that could give my life meaning.

So I decided the only thing I want is ketamine/Spravato. My psychiatrist was trying to prescribe it to me, but they couldn't get their insurance in order. Going to a lab instead of a doctor is prohibitively expensive. I decided I'd wasted enough of my life, and if I couldn't get legal drugs, promising illegal drugs like ketamine and MDMA would have to be my recourse.

And now this virus stuff happened. I barely knew where to find what I was looking for before - I'm hardly going to find it now. So I have to wait even longer. And I'm just waiting to live. Wasting my life."
1,"i'm not sure if this belongs here. so i've wanted since 5th grade to fall asleep & not wake up & i don't find living particularly fun & my mom got help for depression & anxiety for around 2 years & i've talked to her & apparently our symptoms are similar in lots of ways but she doesn't think i'm depressed because i'm only sad in the afternoons or sometimes the school day & sometimes i get really up & things are fine so she doesn't want to take me to at least see (also therapy is expensive)

am i fake depressed or like just sad & suicidal & that's a normal teenage hormone thing or actually depressed bc i'm probably being dramatic but i'm sick of being sad every day even if it's just the afternoons"
1,"What is it like to feel happy. For the longest time I have hated the day to day life that I live. I don’t get any enjoyment out of the things that are supposed to be “fun” like video games or being with my peers. Instead I think of these activities as a chore. I don’t understand how to talk to people and I really don’t have anything to say to them. I have nothing to look forward to everyday, and I have no goals. Everyday is the same thing, I wake up in my bed and I don’t move. Why am I like this? Why do I have no motivation? Why am I so boring? Could I ever feel normal?"
1,"What if you just have done what you desired without being judged. You see here, the reason I am still alive is because I have been controlled by a type of devil named feelings. I always wanted to die and I hate my life every single day even the small things to the big things at my point make me think that. I was always a happy looking person, but deep down I am a dead body buried deep down the soil in a coffin. I have always wanted to kill myself but if I did what would happen. First of all, nobody would believe the fact I killed myself, and they would wonder why. Normally, I look like a normal person outside since I would not express myself a lot to other people. I might leave my family and my friends and they would be sad and depressed and now that would cause more and more and more never ending problems. You see you are being controlled by this world this hell like society forcing you to do things you don’t like and brainwashing you. But there is also another thing that is torturing you, it belongs to you but somehow you cannot control it. It is your feelings, you might wonder, why? Here, let me explain, so look at why you wont kill yourself since it is because the society brainwashed you saying that it is bad and cowardly, and by leaving your family behind and feelings will make you *feel* guilty. The reason you didn’t do the things you love is because this society and the devil feelings is controlling you right now. Everything you know, everything you say is controlled by feelings and society. So lets look at this shit at the other angle. What if, you just got cancer, out of nowhere, it happened and you would die. That would be great but that is where feelings would come in and start torturing you. You wouldn’t want to leave your family behind but you wanted to die which in this scenario it have accomplished your dreams for you. But sometimes a person’s feelings is an angel to them they would do anything to make themselves happy. Now that is where society comes in and starts torturing them. Wanna know why? Here, since they would do anything to fill their joy and if an *angel feeling* person killed themselves since they wouldn’t think too much and that will lead to trouble for people around him. Sounds bad right, it sounds bad because society brainwashed you. It wants you to think the way that you weren’t supposed to think. Why is life hard, it is because of the modern society and depression is becoming more common and more common because of all these shit. The feelings, the stress, the people are all because of this society. Why would your feelings become a devil trying to make you think the other way. You were born in this horrible society, it is how it worked when you were born. And fuck it, fuck this society, fuck this world, fuck everything I own, fuck you god, why would this happen to us at this specific time. Why would these rare angel feelings exist, maybe some people think the other way, for some reason, these people think the other way when they are born. Or, maybe they developed other things living here in this hell but really rare. It matters the most about how you wanted to think and this world controls that. It is making you depressed and it is making us bad. Well, at the end of this long crap which might be bad, I hope you would find yourself a better future, and think that the reason of living is not because of money since the society is like that, the society make life worth money and a lot of people including me wants to end it. I hope this post makes you feel better. And wow, you made it down here, thanks! See you"
1,"Anger gone out of hand. Suffering with depression for the past 4-5 years and I've had help on and off.

One of the worst symptoms I think I experience is irritability and anger. It is just out of hand at this point. 

I mainly divert my anger towardd my family and never my friends or strangers or classmates. 

But I lash out terribly at them , especially my mom. My poor mom. It gets rough sometimes, and it really only just starts with me back talking. Which will then result in her talking back to me sometimes and then I will completely lose my shit, and just shout or swear. 

I dont ever usually yell any insults directed towards her, I will usually just mindlessly yell about my anger, or sometimes I will yell at her blaming her for how I am now, or yell at her over a stupid argument over something like a cup, etc.. alongside that, if I am in a bad mood I will just snap back at her my response instead of responding like a civilized person.

I feel bad, but In the moment I do not always feel bad. I have a hard time finding a healthy outlet for my thoughts so i personally believe that it comes expressed through aggression.

It is usually that I am sensitive and I just pick fights with everyone in the house. 

Its terrible because I know I'm being a pain in the ass, but it's worse because I dont have it under control and im putting people I care about under unacceptable remarks and a bitchy attitude all because I had a bad day.

Is this something meant for anger management?
Are there any mechanisms that can get me to stop myself before I lash out? To recognize that there are innocent people I deeply care about in front of me and that I shouldn't act that way towards them? I can feel my rage unnecessarily build up in the moment and then before I know it, it unleashes on everyone."
1,"This is the toughest test we are all going to face!!. Hello there fellow redditors,
I have been on this sub-reddit for a minute and lately, I’ve been reading too much that Covid stay-at-home has gotten everyone peaking on stupid thoughts(that is what I call my depression and anxiety). 

I (23M) have been in US for roughly about 2 years. And, I’ve literally wasted one and half year over my ex who initially said she wanted to be with me and but it ain’t worthwhile for her to join me here. Life was getting good after crazy depression and anxiety to a point that my chest would literally hurt like its bursting out. But, covid hit the planet and caused devastating loss and pain for everyone involved.

I don’t want to tell the world how I had fight my thoughts but what I want to show the world how I made it out and now that I’m at top, no one can stop me anymore.

I know everyone on the thread wants to share the story of what is bothering them but we are going to tell the world how we made it to top!! 

I have made myself a realistic routine and set of goals that can be achieved and set me on a path to greatness! I am open to share everything with whoever is interested and I hope you also join me on my journey and get yourself out like how I will!! 

Thank you and have an awesome day!!"
1,"I [M 21] have depression that started 1.5 months into my relationship with my girlfriend [F 18] and I fear I'm falling out of love.. Sorry. This is a crosspost from RA but since no one responded in two hours I thought this might be a better place to ask... sorry!



Hello there,

Around the beginning of March, toward one of the nights, I was hanging out with my girlfriend and a friend, when suddenly a wall of anxiety hit me. (Do I love her? Should I break up with her??) Out of nowhere. I've never had a problem like this before. We talked about it, she said she wasn't really sure. She said she'd support me no matter what, I've started medication and started seeing a therapist. She's the most caring and kind person I've ever met, she's meeting my every need, and she's doing everything she can to make sure I know she loves me and she supports my journey. We are long distance unfortuntately, which isn't the end goal, but, important to mention, we want to meet and go on a date in August.

It feels like there's a part of me that's convinced I don't love her at all, and that I should break it off to save her the pain. But I don't want to, it's a sort of internal conflict. I legitimately cannot tell if I'm falling out of love or if I'm just dealing with depression and the remnants of being quickly and harshly dumped by my previous girlfriends. (Probably has something to do with it) I'm so desperate to stay with her and support her and yet it feels like every time we're just talking, and I have a thought like ""you don't love her"" it's all i can think about for the next couple hours. It's no doubt taking a toll on our relationship which is why I want to fix it so badly. I've never wanted to be fixed for anyone before. She is worth it. But I'm so terrified I'm in denial, sometimes we talk but I can't feel anything for her, then my anxiety kicks up to convince me I don't love her. It's terrifying. Everything triggers fear.

The reason I'm making this post is because last night I nearly had a breakdown at my own thought process. She asked me, as a thought exercise, if she thought ""the thought of her with someone else upsets me, or losing her upsets me"" and it didn't, in that moment. Which made me feel like complete and utter shit.

Then, today, we continued talking about what happened last night, trying to figure out happened, we played animal crossing, and it was nice. I felt comfy.

She asked me, a couple hours later, if I thought a break might help. I got scared, I felt terrified, scared, I didn't want to lose her, I wanted to cling to her and never let go.

I'm so scared and confused and I don't know what to do. My therapist has ignored me for 3 weeks after my first meeting with her and I haven't had anyone to bounce these thoughts off of except my poor girlfriend who is doing SO MUCH to help me through this.

Please let me know what you think.

TL;DR, I cannot tell if I love my girlfriend anymore and I'm terrified."
1,"Fuck it. I've been planning my suicide for a while now. I just needed to figure out how exactly. Well I've settled. Shotgun to the face while sitting on train tracks. 100% death rate.

My problems? 

Can't connect with anyone.

I'm 5'9 which is very short to most people it seems.

I'm 75% black 25% Korean so nobody looks like me.
I'm unemployed.

No car or license.

Not in school.

I sleep on a couch.

My penis is 6 inches give or take which is apparently really small.

I'm starting to get skinny fat.

I'm 22 and losing my youth.

Depression stole my teen years.

I'm apparently attractive but I'm too fucked up for anyone to love.

The only girl who would love me left after I fucked it up.

I'm still stuck on said girl since December 2018.

I've got Tinnitus that's probably connected to my TMJ/Dz but I'm too scared to call a dentist/specialist and being told I'm not enough of an emergency to see. (Fuck Covid)

That Tinnitus makes things lose meaning because all I'm able to think about is the ringing.

My only passion is music but the ringing makes me depressed as hell when I'm in my studio.

And lastly. I've got no future.

so fuck it. soon as I get my taxes I'm buying the gun. and walking to the train tracks."
1,"Depending on someone for happiness never work.. Once it’s all over, you’re just left with the same empty feeling you started with. On to the next person, right? No, I can’t keep doing this to myself."
1,"Nobody loves me. Today was a great day. My girlfriend dumped me out of nowhere and said it’s not you it me. I know this was a lie and it crushed me. Later on in the day my friend got mad at me for not reason and said nobody loves me, the said part is I know that’s true. I feel like there no point to any of this shit called life anymore. Now I’m just sitting in my room with a rope around my neck. God I hate being alive it’s all pain and suffering, nothing matter we all die in the end."
1,"Retail is killing me. At some point during my shift, I had the urge to scrape at my skin with a knife. Hadn't had those thoughts in ages, but since I've never did cutting I guess it's not something to worry about. The sheer ignorance and entitlement of people is wearing me down, I don't bother to be quiet around my co-workers anymore and now I talk shit about customers when I get really angry. I suppose my facade is breaking; the bright side of wearing a mask is that no one can see my sad face.

I've been calling off of 8 hour shifts since this virus started and since I might get in trouble for it, I'll have to do tomorrow's 8 hour shift. I want to cry, I want to die, I feel so alone and I just want to disappear. I have a hour and 15 minutes left and it feels like a eternity. I feel like shit, kill me please"
1,"My life is extremely pointless, I'm just a forgettable guy. I'm an extremely forgettable person.  If I were to die today literally only my immediate family and 1 or 2 other people would even care.  

I'm poor.  Quiet.  Alone.  People don't really care whether I exist or not.  

What's the point of that?  If you don't affect those around you in any sort of way, then you're just a blip in the timeline of human existence.  Forgotten immediately. 

Maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's just being a guy in western society.  Maybe it's just being a minority.  I don't know.  

One example that sticks out in my mind really strongly is when my ex dumped me.  She was a terrible mentally fucked up person, liked to use drugs, drank a shit load and was black out drunk several times a week.  And yet, once she dumped me she immediately had another guy who wanted to date her.  As terrible of a person as she was, she still had someone who wanted to be with her.  Was it because she was a woman?  Because she was decently cute and would put out?  I don't know.  But to have her fuck me up as badly as she did, and move onto someone new like she wasn't the terrible one in the relationship really cuts deep.  

It's been like 2 years now and she's probably had 2 or 3 boyfriends in that time, and I still haven't dated since.  As a guy in America, if you don't reach out to people, no one gives a fuck about you and will never reach out to you."
1,"4/13/2020. “Where is the lamb that gave you your name ?”

Gone, the waves took her away. Drowned under the blue sky, the memories of you and I. Do not tempt me, for I am breathing under these chains... Let me go, little lamb."
1,"Am I depressed or am I a teenager?. I don’t really know what to do with my life and I’m just a teenager, I’m constantly sad and I have family issues. I’ve gotten into fistfights with my dad as he sometimes gets very aggressive when I play video games and such, he constantly calls me useless, idiot, stupid, pussy, etc. He hates my interests (which are video games and technology) calling them useless pastimes. I’ve tried to talk about these problems with my mom but she often just tells me they don’t matter and I’ll “walk them off”. 

This has lead me into the point of not knowing weather my problems are important or not, I’m middle class so I definitely know some people have it worse than me. That is why feeling bad about my problems feels stupid to me, and I know I should be happy for what I’ve got, yet I have not been happy for a long time. I usually wonder if I’m depressed or if I’m just a teenager with sad “episodes”. I can’t seem to find the answer, this is why I come to this subreddit 

I have the best grades in my school and I take pride on how quickly I learn, I happily bring my A’s to my dad seeking for some form of recognition but I do not get it, he tells me it is my obligation. I want to make games for a living but now I don’t know if my parents will even support my career choice. 

Thank in advance for your comments and support. (Sorry if my English isn’t that good, my first language is Spanish)"
1,"I can’t imagine a future where I’ll be happy. My situation. I’ve been depressed for about 6 years (F20). Many diagnosises, treatments, still depressed. After some horrible circumstances during New Years where I had to flee the country for my safety, I realized my depression was strongly linked to my immediate family and how they treat me. Very rich, but neglectful stereotype. Mother had anger issues and used to insult me to the point of suicide from as long as I can remember until now.

We’re in lockdown. After going to uni I discovered this thing called self worth, but I had to leave my accommodation and go back home. It took only a few days before I was skipping meals (anorexia survivor) and on the verge of suicide ideation.  Once the lockdown started here I had a breakdown at the thought of being locked in a house with my whole family, not just for my mental health but relapsing on anorexia and likely attempting suicide, just down to being in the situation where I had been convinced by my family for years I deserved to die, and not being allowed to see friends or escape. My boyfriend convinced me to stay at his parents house, so I ran away before midnight.

Now. It’s been 3 weeks. I’ve been buying my own food but I don’t have infinite money. I feel ashamed and guilty. Thinking about the future makes me cry uncontrollably. I’ve started having nightmares about my family. I don’t know when I can go back to uni and my summer internships have been cancelled. It’s getting to me that I don’t have a home in the whole world, I’m couch surfing. I have other couches in other homes but  there’s no where that’s my home. And I feel like I don’t have family either. No money, no home, no family. Running out of goodwill. I’m very depressed. I’m unable to continue treatment for depression and I went off SSRIs about a month ago due to not being able to see a doctor. 

I have another 1.5 years of university that my parents pay for (no grants or loans at all where I live). I can’t get a job due to lockdown and no transport. I just don’t see any future at all. I can’t just forgive my parents. They lie, gaslight, and have screwed up family therapy in the past. I’m in danger around them because I will just obey them when they tell me I’m worthless and shouldn’t be alive. I’m not eligible for any services to help me. I don’t have a job, a house, work, or school for 5 months and it seems logical to end my life and tie up the loose end that no one wants. I don’t have another option."
1,"Just a question. I've been dealing with depression for most my life and it's kinda ruined my life. I've tried therapy and pills but I can never shake it. Even though its ruined my life I still feel terrible about suppressing the depression, I see it as a part of me and as who I really am, like that's the real me. I'm curious if it's normal to feel like that's who I really am?"
1,"I'm starting to realize I have no passions, no talents, no dreams. Everything I used to love, I hate and can't seem to bring that enjoy back. Other than that, I have nothing. I just sit in my own self pity while hating everything around me. I don't want to be that person but like fuck. How bout you put yourself in my shoes and see how you like it. It's dark and disturbing isn't it? Like sorry I can't be genuinely happy like other people. Sorry I can't achieve the things I want to achieve. I've just lost all hope. Maybe I'm feeling this way because of being quarantined, but maybe that's a good thing because I'm seeing and understanding who I really am: a fucked up individual."
1,"Is anyone else kind of dreading the end of quarantine?. I know this quarantine is absolutely horrible for a lot of people, so not everyone will agree with me on this. But...

Confession; I am fucking loving being in lockdown. I think it’s a really shitty situation and I’m sorry that everyone the world over is being affected to negatively by this, but I’m making the best out of it. I’ve only recently started working on my mental health and acknowledging my depression and anxiety since last December. This time to just focus on myself and be, with no responsibilities or family drama or struggling to get out of bed for people I don’t want to work for while making no money and actually getting to spend time with my husband has been a major blessing for me. A week before lockdown I was discharged from the hospital for having a major depressive episode due to a new medication. I usually compare my depressive mood to being dark grey/going black, which is where I was before lockdown, and now I’m a light/medium grey. I already know I’m gonna go back to black when it’s over. It’s going to be really hard to have to force myself to function all over again and knowing the same bullshit stressors that made me feel bad before are waiting for me is already bringing on the dark mood. It’s not like I’m getting salaried pay or anything, my unemployment is not going through and I’m fighting with them for over three weeks now, so I’m broke as shit. I’m just appreciating the fact that my brain and body can take a break for the time being."
1,"I just climbed out onto my roof, and I laughed?. Depressed teen here, hi:) I’m your typical good grades no drugs or alcohol girl, the one everyone thinks is super smart and has a future but just got the short stick on circumstances. I’ve grown up my whole life afraid, afraid of what people might think, or do, or might act. If I don’t do the right thing I’ll get punished, or yelled at. Maybe I’ll be kicked out and not able to finish school. I worry often, about everything. The only reason I’m alive is cause my brother and sister but mainly my cat. My cat has been missing for weeks and I played it off as I couldn’t help it, like it’s not my fault. Today, I was doing my online classes and biology sucks. Finally I just broke down, all my stress I’ve been keeping in, my thoughts, my sadness. I just cried, and I cried, at first I blamed it on my biology homework but I know that it was deeper than that. I kinda laid in my bed for the last few hours just, waiting, for nothing.

My window has a ledge off it where I can go put on, if I fell I wouldn’t die but would definitely get hurt. But I can also climb higher up. Anyway, I’ve always been scared to do anything “bad” because what if I get caught? What if the moment I decide to do something someone catches me or shows up? The neighbors? Anyone. But tonight I opened my window, I crawled out and I sat against my window. I played my music. I felt like at any moment I could slip from this ledge and... if I fell, I’d be caught. Not even concerned for myself. And I sat there, and I laughed. I laughed for a good five minutes. My legs were trembling and I laughed.

I don’t know if I have deeper root problems or something but, that’s the first time I ever did anything “bad” like sneaking out or what not. I felt crazy for laughing, but it felt so good. 

Shortened: I’m a goody two shoes with depression and tonight I did something I usually wouldn’t and I laughed and don’t think that’s normal but it felt good:)

Id like to add, I hope this post isn’t offensive and you think I’m just some teen who had a moment and thought she was depressed. I’d like to clarify I’ve been suicidal, scared and depressed since I was 12 years old. (Just for clarifications sake idk? I just feel like I have to explain myself? And I don’t wanna go that deep into it. Anyway have a goodnight)"
1,"I don’t want to up my meds. kind of a rant ...
my ex got into three Ivy League Universities and it triggered this. 

This Covid-19 cause me to loose my support system, I live in a difficult household so I’m on edge constantly. I FaceTimed my psych (which I do in secret) and she said I should go up 50mg more on my prescription and I was relatively happy talking to her? Am I blind? I don’t know how I feel and what if she sees something I can’t? This just justifies my insecurities, I thought I was getting better?! 
 
Fast forward a few days to now: 
so I think being perfect will cure my depression, hA so my ex got into these schools and I’m here with uva which 10 people (among such I don’t enjoy) are going with me. I feel like there is something so wrong with me to be rejected I think why them what do they have that I don’t? Maybe If I wasn’t so depressed for the past two years I would have done better in high school! I think I’m dumb I think I’m not good enough and I never will be."
1,"I can’t remember the last time I was happy. I have been sad for a long time. It’s been so long that I can’t even remember a time I was happy. I recently told a girl that I had feelings for her. But I knew she didn’t feel the same. But even still, this is like the most sad I’ve been for being rejected. I’ve always been bummed, but I’ve never actually been sad. And this is the saddest I’ve ever been for something like that. And being a young guy, (I’m 15) I wanna say that it’s just being a teen, and that there would be plenty of other girls, but I don’t want any other girls, I want her. She’s treated me better than most of my friends. She understands me. I go to her when I’m stressed, and she never complains about me going to her, even though she should. Sorry I’m just ranting but really. I don’t want money or anything. I just want her. And I just want to be happy. Thank you for reading"
1,"Done chasing.. I run through the grass,
green with envy,
to catch up with my shadow. 
It brings me to the beach,
in which I step,
only to find the waters shallow. 
The light in my eyes is slipping away,
as the breath in my lungs quiver. 
The darkness within is caving in
and sealed in the cold I begin to shiver. 
This game is moving way to fast 
and I can’t keep up with its pace. 
Nobody is coming back for me,
and it seems I can’t win this race.
       - thanks for reading:)"
1,"Im confused. Hi,

Im contemplating whether to go on a consultation for my mental health or not. Honestly I'm too ashamed to get seek medical attention, next is the cost. But its taking a toll on me as the days go by especially this quarantine period. So please help me to decide, thank you"
1,"Don’t know how to handle my life. Just a little warning ! My main language is German so there are gonna be lots of grammar errors in here!

I recently came to this point in my life where I no longer no how to handle things anymore... there are just so many things in my head dragging me down.

I once had a very good paying job but I left it because it destroyed me mentally only to be left with having to start over in a new branch and now all my friends around me are high paid workers with nice jobs and I have to work my ass off for a minimum wage.

I lost my old flat and had to go into debs to get a new one.

I have a wonderful boyfriend who tries his best to make me fell loved and supports me in so many way but sometimes I am afraid he’s gonna get bored or overwhelmed with me and will leave me.

I come from a big family with 8 siblings where I always felt like I was the least successful, the least beautiful and the least intelligent one. I always had this feeling to let my mom down, like I never did anything she could be proud of.

It’s just I feel like such a worthless human being.. like everyone around me is so amazing and beautiful and wonderful and I .. I am just the outsider.. the ugly one ..the untalented, dumb and worthless one.

The gay son who will never give my mom a grandchild, the childish guy who can never be a full grown adult, the dumb guy who never went for a higher education, the mediocre guy who hasn’t got any talent for anything, the one guy who got many friends but no true friend, the guy who just wants to be loved but is afraid he can’t give enough love to his boyfriend ... and at this moment this guy just needs someone to tell him that his worth living 

I just wanted to finally tell this to someone.

Thanks for reading trough my shity English and gave a nice day."
1,"I don't feel sad, I feel empty.... After my girlfriend broke up with me, I cried for the first day but after that I didn't feel sad, I still don't and I realized that I don't feel anything else, I feel empty, all I can think of is her, I used to play games as a hobby and now even that reminds me of her, I hate my situation because I know that I'm going to be okay, that I will get over her, and that I may find someone else, but I don't want that all I want is her, not someone else.
Sorry for my rant but I had to get it out have a nice morning/day/night."
1,"I don’t know if I can keep going. I just think life is completely pointless. The only thing that keeps me here is my fear of an afterlife. When I’m with people, I feel even more lonely. I joke around to mask my pain and nobody realizes just how tortured I am inside. I’m running out of options."
1,"I'm depressed. But I am also extremely ugly and thus I will never have a boyfriend.. When I say I'm ugly, I promise you, I am ugly. There's nothing wrong with saying it. I'm just ugly. My sister is the complete opposite, she's gorgeous, skinny, with an amazing body and face. She's literally been hit up on instagram by several modelling agencies. She has over 10k followers on there.

The moment anyone meets here and sees me, they're shocked. Like, what the fuck happened? Me being the sister of someone who's completely drop dead gorgeous and you've got me looking like a deformed man.

I can't ever imagine anyone wanting to be with me, my body is horrible as I've lost weight and the skin is just bad. I've got very bad social anxiety which was inherited but also worse because of how I look.

Imagine if I DID ever get a boyfriend? they would see my sister and think ""wtf?"" like everyone else. I've only ever had a boyfriend online who didn't know the extent of how ugly I am bc of my extreme use of filters and editing. Literally I am pathetic.

There's nothing going for me anymore. I have 0 friends in real life and anyone online I talk to doesn't know the extent of how ugly I am.

I discovered yesterday that I actually have an underbite thus making my face appear longer and my chin bigger. It's set me off so badly and I actually don't want to live being this ugly anymore. Everything on my face and body is just fucked up, I have NO good features. Extremely wonky and bent nose, huge chin and jaw, big forehead, too tall, big feet and hands, saggy breasts, sagging skin on my stomach and thighs, lazy eye with uneven eyebrows. I want plastic surgery so bad but in my situation it will never happen. It doesn't help that I'm 6ft tall as a female, even less options as not many guys want a tall girlfriend.

No one will ever want me. I'm a 22 year old female who's never even had a first kiss. It is no ones fault but my own but looking like this and my mental issues I just can't anymore..."
1,"Just when I thought. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, the universe proved me wrong. 

I was doing fine this past few days, I can control my overthinking, I was empty but atleast not in pain, I thought no one could shook me up anymore. Not until last night when we receive the news that my brother hasn’t come home yet and we can no longer contact him. 

Me,My Mom and Grandma was up all night (I live 9 hrs away from them) we were just notified by my brothers friend at around 11 PM that my brother left the house around 2 PM  to get the money that their employeer has sent them and hasnt come home since. We cant still file a report to the police since it hasnt been 24 hours yet.

I wasn’t able to sleep the whole night, I was worried about my brother and I was even more worried about my mon and grandma. Just this morning his friend was able to found him, He was caught and was put to Jail bcoz of drugs. He tested positive for the drug test. He live at another and since we have the pandemic theirs nothing we can fo about it.

I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID TO DESERVE SUCH A MESSY LIFE. The universe can’t give me a break."
1,"now i know why i am depressed. part 1. * i was not depressed as a child but as i got older and started to see my family behave the way they do, i fell into the same trap as them.
* my depression is contagious. i have inherited it from my father who is sadly depressed for the last 20 years.
* i am 22. my father got depressed because of career disappointment, hardships, family struggle and underachievement. he was devastated when all his hard work went into vain.
* he stopped socializing, remains silent, lost in thoughts, blames others, doesn't take responsibility, panics a lot, no joy, no happiness in life, never travels, never goes out except for work, doesn't speak much and also gets angry at us if we enjoy ourselves. he makes us feel guilty for enjoying the life and being happy, threatens suicide. it is clear that failure and embarrassment have ruined his self esteem and self worth.
* not achieving his desired job had ruined his life. while growing up, i was told that this is my father's ""personality"" by my mother (who is a little narcissistic, blames my father for not getting a good job, always concerned about herself, doesn't listen to him talking, victim mentality, superiority complex, puts others down, overly criticizing and controlling nature, thinks she is too good for others, in the 23 years of their marriage my parents have NEVER NEVER EVER talked because my mother thinks that emotions are drama and only ""useless people talk about emotional stuff"" and she is too smart and optimistic to get serious).
* okay. both my parents are victims of life. while my father is sure rude, but failure kills you and i don't know if i should blame him. mother, on the other hand, is caring but doesn't sympathize with my father. she thinks of herself as a human while all others as animals. as if she is a victim in every case and others are her enemies. she expects others to behave well, but she can be childish, crying, shouting, and then threatens us that we will face our fate when we have our own kids.
* i see that the rest of my family who are successful in life have qualities very different from us: they are self assured, sympathetic, cheerful, good at socializing, take responsibility, think that everything is possible, have large social circle (we don't), encourage and believe in their children, doesn't put themselves down in front of others, don't threaten suicide, travel a lot, live lie to the fullest wherever they are. they also talk to their children (my parents don't) and encourage them to achieve great heights, when in problems they don't cry and moan, but look for solutions, stay chill and take control. on the other hand, my father goes into panic mode and blames others and seeks help from others for his problems. he stays distant in social gatherings and stays aloof in a corner.
* sadly my father has never got help for depression. no one even cares about him and that he has depression. i don't know if even he knows whether he has it. he is done with life. since my mother doesn't love him and he doesn't love my mother, their lives are miserable."
1,"Ever wanted to talk to someone you trust but then realize that you don't trust anyone. I don't trust anyone. Not even family

I don't trust my mom because she tells anyone. I don't trust my brothers because i got no releations with them. I don't trust anyone. And I can't trust anyone"
1,"I feel like I'm terrible at everything. All my life people have made me feel like I'm shit at everything that I do or touch even if I love it. In Highschool, I was in soccer and I loved it so much but everyone was so hateful towards me and made me feel like the worst to ever touch a ball, they made me cry weekly and made me feel mentally pathetic and they acted as if they never even talked to me or know what they did, and even in my life's passion of snakes and venomous reptiles, someone said that it's bullshit that I'm educated/experienced with them only because I asked a simple question. I just feel so lonely and hated and that I can't do anything right."
1,"I need advice. I went through a horrible breakup a couple years ago. The person I dated was a pathological liar and narcissist, and I have so many trust issues from the relationship. My depression and anxiety have gotten worse over the last year, and seeing a therapist hasn't helped. I don't have feelings for him anymore, because the guy I liked never truly existed, but it feels like I can't have strong feelings for anyone ever again. It's not that I won't let myself, it's that I genuinely don't find anyone as good as I thought he was... does anyone have any advice for me?"
1,Whenever you’re in a group. Do your friends critique you for being too quiet or weird/creepy and then you start to open up more and they still critique you for being annoying/weird? Lol there’s just no winning for me. I just stick to very small talk now. Mostly quiet. I don’t know how to please some people.
1,"At this point I desire for nothing better than to be a nihilistic black void of hatred that brings depression to everyone else around me.. If I cannot be happy, then I can at least make everyone else depressed, huh?"
1,"The Stress is about to make me lose my mind. I remember that the stress began when I was like 15. I could handle it then, things seemed a little brighter. Maybe not swell since I was already suicidal, but it wasn't this god damn bad. The depression started around the same time. 15, normal time to have depression or anxiety problems as a kid, right? 16 hit and I tried to work on myself, call me a quitter or a failure all you want. I started to hit the gym with my brother to the best I could do. I studied harder. Showered more often, ate less, ate better, tried to explore whatever semblance of a passion for anything I had. I don't want to turn this into a pity party, cuz this is all my fault in the end, I know that, I accept that, but God, fucking, damn. I never gained muscle, never toned, never lost weight doing the cardio. I failed more classes as I tried harder in them, I still managed to smell like shit after I kept clean constantly, I am still a fat fuck to this day. But now I am a skinny/fat fuck. I just watched the scale drop to 199, from 250 back when I was 16. I don't know why but this triggered me to write this. That stress has just built up to such a horrific summit now, at 19. The real world is hitting hard. Two dead end jobs that I've nearly lost due to Covid. Friends leaving me cuz I'm too busy. Rent pilling up for the parents who don't care. Got another rejection letter from another school for being too retarded to be apart of them. God it's like there's a fire in my skull all day long, all night long. I have dreams of being stressed. Of being light on fire. Or just dying. Doing anything to make this burning in my skull stop. I do the meditations, the fucking Japanese hand holding thing. I pray and I exercise still, but god, nothing nothing nothing calms me down. Nothing keeps the fire out of my head. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to lose it. I can't sleep anymore. It's been nearly two days. I'm sorry for a rant post from a whiney bitch but god damn. My therapist won't listen to me so I don't have anywhere else to go."
1,"I don't know what is happening. I can't organise my own thoughts, there are so many of them at once I feel like I'm about to fucking explode.

I can't relax, I'm always anxious and I don't even know why

Things that I enjoyed are not interesting anymore, like everything was black and white and the world lost its colors

I'm so exhausted because of everything happening at once"
1,My best friend blocked me and I'm not sad about it. So my best friend and I had fought a while back like we just stopped talking cause I got mad at her for telling my sister something private but then I thought we worked things out but a couple weeks ago she just blocked me on all platforms and when I saw her at church and asked her about it she just shrugged her shoulders so I told her I was done with her bullshit and walked away and ik i should me sad about it but I dont feel anything about it. Which really worries me because I'm afraid that my depression is getting bad again.
1,"Help. Okay, I don't know where to start from this, but if there any spelling errors im sorry, because the tears are covering my eyelids. But I guess I should start with the fact that I'm not normally a suicidal person but the though has been crossing my mind whenever bad moments come and go since August (me moving in with my dad) and im also not just some edgy guy looking for attention, but I honestly don't know where else to go. I can't even tell if this is my way of coping, or if I think some magical solution will come from this. But im desperate. So one problem i've been having is with myself. It's not that i've everhaf trouble making friends but it's something else. I can't pinpoint it but I would make friends at school because imbalone. I have never actually walked up to someone to befriend them ive always just sat by myself and people came to me. Yet I was still a really outgoing person I just didn't how. Kind of pathetic for someone who has been to 7 different school because of moving huh? So I'm already a guy with not a lot of friends. But the main place I made friends was over online gaming. And ive met so many people that I know have changd me for the better. And i had thisnone really close friend named joey, I met him while playing rainbow 6 and we became good friends since. Bit then shorlynafter I moved here I was told by one of our other friends (who was close to his half brother) that he'd commitednsuicde. And that was the first big death ive ever had in my life. AND IT WAS ONLINE and in still thinking back to wether or bot I couldve done somthing to make it better because we were just having a blast on overwatch two nights begore. I know its bot my fault and that his family was mourning so much more. So i told everyone in our friend group to send his mother our condolences and it turned out okay.

Now indont know the character limit on reddit so im gonna keep thisbshprt. Im mainly just sad because I habe no form of control in my life right now. I move to minnesota with my dad with 4 other little brothers on is 11 and doesnt do any of his chpres and gets away with it he doesnt even feed his animals (beong two cats turtle and a lizard). Ones 9.amd has some learning problems, so he hets leniency, but that's fair. And the others who are 6 and 3 just run around messing up, stealing food from the kitchen, allowed to curse for some reason. And all of this haappens while they are under the watxh of my dad and step mom. So I the oldest at 16 have to clean the whole kitchen, that my step mom perpously messes up and allows my brothers to get away with eatimg in there. And the one that put me into this mess, cleaning the EMTIRE downstairs. So my dad and stepmom jave been sleeping down here for the past few nights with my little brothers (6&3) and they are supposed to go upstairs and sit in their bed by 8. But for some reason, they have been allowed to ait dpwn here with them and MESS UP THE PLACE. The parents are sitting there breaking their own rules by bringong all of these quilts and covers downstairs, Nd bringing tons of food and drinks. They also just let my little brother get all of these chips and drinks spilled all over the place. And then they just dont clean ot up... This has been happening for the past 3 nights now, and I began to get sick of it. Zince I'm cleaning up after MY OWN PARENTS, and no ome else is doimg any of their chores at all! My little brother (11) isnt cleaning his room or the upstairs bathroom, and my otger brother (9) ismt doing his room or the dinong room, amd getting away with it. And i get my xbox taken away because MY LITTLE BROTHERS WHO DONT EVEN LISTEN TO THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THEIR CHORES??? And since im supposed to be the ""big brother"" and clean up after everyones messes, and constantly tell these little rats to do what they are supposed to, and apparemtly act as the damn house maid 24/7. Just to get yelled at for doing a parents job... So later today, I tried to confront my dad softly, since the day befoew he asked me if everyrging was okay, and if I needed to talk about anything. And thatbtime i said no. But today i try and ask him ""dad, if you and my stepmom are here watching these kids, can you make sure they don't mess up""? And at first he said ""yeah"". Keep in mind that this same day, my stepmom said no games for anyone because she finally decided to do something aboutbthe kids not doing their chores, but it didnt make sense for me to be in trouble since i don't jave a SINGLE grade under 97, and my kitchen amd downstairs have been spotless (but my dad told me it was because I wasnt makomg the kids do their chores as i said above). And i guess she ran her mouth at my dad, because thats all he was saying when he started getting mad. So he literally just got mad because i politely asked him to not let the kids mess up.

So then, he decided to beat me...
I was just so shokes, and to thin kbaout it is starting to make me cry again because i cant believe that the one man i used ti look up to, just beay me over a situation so rediculous. And this was only the second time it happened. I remember about a month ago he was on the couch woth my step mom, and when i walked by he asked me about wheyger or not i had any friends. And of course i had some ao said yes, but I think some thoughts began to spill out of me because I didnt cry, but tears started to fall. And so my dad asked me why I was crying, and once I said no reason, he punched me to ground, and started throwing punhes at my ribs that later went into him slamming me onto the ground.. All because I was sad about my sacial life.
And of course theres a lot more to it, but im just so sad right now because there's nothing i can do, i cant talk about it because i would risk of making my dad or stepmom mad, i cant vent with any of my friends because im not allowed to, and i dont want to do nothing because I'd just go back to being a complete house maid. amd its not cleaning that's the problem, it's the punishments i get for not making the kids do their chores, or for not cleaning up after them roght. So I'm just lost as to what to do. Um just here contemplating running away, or flat out suicide. But I don't know what to do if I run away, simce I dont want to steal food and mess someone else's life up. So theres just suicide and the only thing stopping that is the fear of what could come since it either eternal nothingness, or if religion tirns out to be true, eternal damnation. But im afraid that once I'm pushed over that fear, there wouldnt be any going back...

So please, if you know of ANYTHING i can do, help"
1,I’m just not a “life” person. Some people aren’t morning people. Why is this any different
1,"Middle Schooler that can’t be productive. No friends and can’t make any more.. Just wrote my life story and reddit didn’t want me to post it and now it’s gone, I’ll summarize key points here.

-Three year old me wants to be a prodigy

-Elementary school me didn’t do that, but bragged about it enough to not have friends until fifth grade

-I made friends for first time but I was the loser of a basketball clique

-I am fat

-I go to middle school, basketball clique is no more. I fail to force myself in to a anime/meme clique.

-I get depressed and act 2010 meme cringey but this girl is nice to me and ends up being the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. Good grades

-Next year of middle school, my grades are good, I get in to a clique about Anime/Memes (different one), no depression and playing football. However, the nice girl is now in highschool.

-Winter break at cadet thing, all of my friends stopped laughing at my jokes and awkward silence. Two of them get real passive aggressive and we don’t talking very much but we all pretend that I’m still am friends with everyone

-Here we are, me not wanting to say I am depressed because I always thought depressed people need to get over themselves. On the internet too much, feuding with my parents, no friends, terrible physique and terrible grades. I miss the girl that was nice to me, I should have appreciated her more. I am really sad and quarantine is preventing me from making any new friends. I have turned to both YouTube for therapy videos and discord for friends, those have failed me. 

- I have a tall, wide frame. I know I’m smart. I have all of this potential and I just can’t motivate myself into anything anymore. I find myself wasting entire days doing nothing. I am not suicidal, but I’ve thought about it in the past.

- I find myself unable to get anything done anymore, ever. My grades suck and I haven’t been able to do more than one assignment every forty eight for the past few months."

&#x200B;

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, and for my dissertation I am investigating how instagram use affects mood.  Current research is conflicted as to the effects of social media, and oftentimes research is done cross-sectionally and not in the immediate sense.  I am hoping to change this with my research, and better understand the immediate link between using Instagram and mood across a range of participants.

I am currently recruiting research participants who are between the ages of 18-35, use Instagram at least once every other day, and can complete phone surveys on their smartphones multiple times a day.

If you are interested in participating, it would be a huge help to our team.  The study will take one week, will involve filling out surveys on your own smartphone, and you will be compensated up to **$70.00** in Amazon gift cards for participating in all portions of the study. There will be no direct benefit to participants.

If you are interested in participating, please click the link to this survey and complete it:

1,"Looking at my old photos. I've been doing mostly good during this whole quarantine, most of my depression comes from the anxiety I get around other people. But looking back through my pictures it really sucks to see how sad I am. Like, I deserve to feel good about myself. But looking back through, literally a few years of my life, all I can see are photos of myself with a depressed look in my eyes. It scares me to see that. I could easily slip back into what I'm so used to. Depressed and isolated..

I haven't been seeing my therapist since the quarantine. But mostly because I felt like I was okay just staying home. Idk, it's just sad to see myself in so much pain"
1,What can I do when feel worthless ?. just can't see anything in myself that anyone would like it.
1,I accidentally cut my skin. And that is not as painful as i imagined. So i continued and made some pattern on my skin. It makes me feel better now.
1,"Lost my mojo ... is it depression?. Not much makes me happy....I distract myself with video games and Facebook and reddit.  I lost my business...and after being the boss...every other job sucks. I’m not qualified for anything, really. Thought of going to school for a year or two for another shitty job doesn’t appeal. Getting older...no chance of an early retirement.  There’s got to be more to life.  Working a dead end, corporate, cubicle, sales customer service shit job for the rest of my life makes me want to die.  At some point I’m just going to throw it all in, give it away leave it behind and go on an adventure till my money runs out and then I’ll be homeless and then?"

I know my friends mean well, but I feel trapped in this bubble of hopelessness, I'm seeing how good everyone else's lives are, how many friends they have that care about them, how fun their lives are, and it feels like I'll end up dying one way or another before I get to experience that"

Sometimes I get scared because of how much I rely on my lies since without it I don't have support in school, I don't have a social life with anyone but my friend and I don't have a mental world to flee to when things get to hard. even in this post there are lies.

1,"Anyone taking Zoloft and SUPER tired?. I've been taking 150 mg daily of Zoloft for several months (last September I think is when my doc increased the dosage from 50) now and have also been consistently exhausted almost 24/7. I can function and feel energized for a couple of hours if I drink an energy drink (which I know is a bad solution but is my band aid for the moment so I can get homework done). 

Does anyone else experience this, or could it be unrelated?"
1,"nothing is enjoyable. i dont wanna play any video games, nothing on youtube or netflix or hulu that i wanna watch, nothing that would be enjoyable. only thing i wanna do is be with this girl"
1,"my friend always thinks she’s right but i still love her.. this might be a shit reason to get all worked up and stuff but like okay.

me and my long time best friend who i would die for were playing minecraft. We got off and agreed to get back on at six, which would be two hours before we were gonna invite two others to our world. 

i haven’t slept in a day or so and i was gonna take a nap, but she said no bc we were gonna get on at six. six cake around and she didnt get on. i was pissed.

she then said at 8 that she never agreed to six and that she didn’t wanna answer my messages. she could have at least gave me a heads up so i could have slept or not felt like shit bc she was ignoring me

so at 8 i mention how she forgot ab me and she PISSED OFF and says how i’m lying and how she never said 6 when we fucking agreed to it’s making me all worked up and i wanna cry and fucking slice me open bc she always does this.

she always says that she’s right. She doesn’t know it’s so triggering to have to tell her that she’s right all the time even tho she’s not. i was right in this situation and she still made me say it was her so she wouldn’t get mad

she does it as a joke sometimes which is semi okay, but when she’s serious is makes me wanna fucking cry. When she’s in a bitch mood she’s in a bitch mood and i can’t even talk to her at that point bc i can’t deal with it.

and yeah, it’s triggering to be told your wrong all the time. 

but at the same time i wish i could tell her about this and everything but i’m afraid she would just say something that would make me upset ig. 

i don’t know at this point 

idk what this post is either too.."
1,"A survivor. Dealing with depression is always a battle. For a 42yo guy like me, I have suffered since I was a pre-teen. There have been events in my life where I almost said ""That's it. I've had it"". 

But I'm posting to let you know that there is a light at the end of that deep dark tunnel or in some cases sunshine behind that grey cloud. 

How I have survived bipolar depression.
1. I say this to myself every morning in the mirror: ""I love myself. I love my job. I love my family. I love my life.""

2. I surround myself with light. What I mean by that is I laugh. Laughter not only forces that sour down expression to change. It releases a chemical to the brain that seems to counter act the gloomy feeling.

3. I have hobbies. From video gaming to crocheting. I keep busy. 

4. I have a Rose and Thorn coversation. Rose=the good things. Thorn= the bad things. 

5. I change those thorns to roses.

6. I remember a wise drag queen once said, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you going to love someone else."" She also said, ""You are your own worst saboteur. Don't let yourself get in your own way."" 

7. I talk to my mother, who also suffers from depression. We battle this together. 

8. I find joy ever in the smallest things. Like reading my favorite book or watching my favorite movie. Book=The Chronicals of Narnia. Movie= The Last Unicorn. 

9. I listen to inspirational music. 

10. Yes, this helps, I don't know why, but I cry. 

The reason why I am posting this is because what is going on this day in age, where isolation and social distancing has become the norm. More often then naught depression is the feeling of emptiness hopelessness, and loneliness. But you know what, it doesnt have to be. We can battle together. 

Stay strong. We can and will do this together. There is no cure, but together we can push back the dark and let the light shine through. 

Love you all."
1,i relapsed and i’m not living for myself anymore. i’m not alive for myself. i’m alive for everyone around me. for my friends and my family. i don’t care about myself. i love every day hoping it could be my last. i relapsed again and i’m not proud but it happened and i don’t know what to do about it. i’m so tired of everything and being hurt.
1,"are you guys also just sort of waiting to die?. im just kind of sitting idly, unmotivated. i dont enjoy anything anymore and I have one friend. i don’t want to kill myself though. im just sort of waiting."
1,"22/M depressed because of love. I think love is a cycle - and it happens every single time. I am still young, just a measly 22 years old. However, I feel like i have experienced much more than others when it comes to this...

It always begins the same.. infatuation, butterflies in the stomach, staring at your phone waiting for that message or call.

That is my favorite stage, without a doubt.

I get so involved in this stage, at times I wish I could just hit a pause button to have more time to appreciate the beginning of a relationship. In retrospect, I feel like I always move too fast, and that's where the problem arises.

Then you get to the relationship, and things are amazing. You begin to be together more, start declaring your feelings for the person as much as you can, the feelings of wanting to be with this person every minute of the day just keeps getting stronger.

Until something happens, usually something negative that happens to me, like a depressive effect or an instance of anxiety. And that is when the beginning of the end happens. When you show them that you're a human like everyone else, with real life problems.

And one day their tone is different, they don't sound the same as they used to, and slowly it progresses. Until you receive a text saying that its just not going to work out.

Its a cycle, a cycle that I'm tired of being a part of"
1,"Idk just a stupid ass vent. I feel like I’m really close to killing myself but I really shouldn’t be because I’ve still got quite a lot of my life left, I don’t deserve to live that life tho. I’m disgusting and such a fat ass the only thing I do when I get really low is fucking eat and that’s all I do but I just can’t fucking stop and it hurts because I KNOW I’m doing this to myself and it’s only my fault but it still hurts and I feel trapped in a cycle of slowly ruining my life further

I made a promise to myself that if I was still like this at 16 I’m gonna kill myself but honestly...I think that’s gonna happen much sooner now, it’s not just eating either I’m a horrible selfish asshole that is lazy and I used to put so much effort into making other happy even if it made me sad but I just don’t care anymore. I just want to stop feeling like this every fucking day and I’m terrified of going back to school because then there won’t be an excuse to be like this and other people will start to see my failing but I don’t want to bother them with my life or existing anymore."
1,"I don’t care. I really don’t. So, I’m impatient and don’t take time in doing anything so here is my short rant. 6 months ago I got a gf, honestly my ideal girl. I did Xanax and went to jail for a day and didn’t talk to her for 2, it’s only been downhill from thr, I suspect she cheated and a friend of hers told me and showed me proof. I want to kill my self because the girl that told me made me feel like I have a small dick. And in my mind I won’t feel okay with myself until I fuck a bunch of women, but I’m not attractive. I failed, I lost the girl I love. I’m 19. Don’t have my GED, can’t get it because of corona, gonna go back to high school but do it online. But I have no motivation to do anything. I’m not interested in anything. I smoke weed. On and off. It doesn’t help or make it worse. Some of my worse thoughts have been sober. I deleted social media because anything that remains me of sex makes me want to dieZ and I lost hope in women being loyal. I’m talking causially on ps4 and this one girl says she left someone of 5?years for someone else. I’m done caring. Fuck I may just go back to smokin meth. But really get into it this time."
1,"The Beauty in Tragedy. 
""Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""- Scott Fitzgerald

Idk why I'm posting this, just kind of felt like getting some things off my chest anonymously. 

I believe that tragedy, as awful as it is, can lead to a more beautiful life. The great thing about hitting rock bottom, is that once you're there and you can't go any lower, from that point on you can only do two things: stay at the bottom, or rise. 
Everyone faces hardship in their life, some more difficult and trying than others, whether that be the death of a loved one, drug abuse, family or marriage issues, we all face it at some point or another. 
This world is dark and cruel, and it shows no mercy. If you let it, this world will consume you. But if you let your hardships transform you instead of destroy you, you can create the best version of yourself that you have ever been. Tough times make stronger people, and the more resilient you become to this world, the better. 
In my personal experience, these last few years in my life haven't been very fun to say the least. I had knee and shoulder surgery which at the time disqualified me from the military (which was what I had always wanted to do since I was a kid), My dad almost died from medical malpractice, I lost my mother and aunt to suicide 6 months apart, found out my girlfriend of almost 3 years at the time was cheating on me, went through a horrible breakup, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, got kicked out of my house several times and slept in my car in an Arby's parking lot, gained a shit ton of weight, and lost some of my best friends. I completely let myself go as a person.

One day I had just had enough of the mental torment I was in, so I put a gun in my mouth. I sat there in my car for hours trying to get myself to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it. That's when I realized that if I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger then, I could never convince myself to do it in the future. That was my rock bottom. 

I didn't kill myself, but I killed the old version of myself. I decided from that day on to the future, I would work on becoming the person I had always wanted to be, and let my trauma mold me into a better person. 

3 years later, I've come to terms with the death of my mother and no longer blame myself, I don't use drugs anymore, gained control of my drinking habits, went from being 245lbs to 190lbs and in-shape, and I even joined the Army like I had always wanted to. I gained control of my depression and now live a much better life. Honest to God, I haven't had the thought of suicide cross my mind since that day in the Arby's parking lot. 

The way I try to look at life is like this: always appreciate the good times and cherish them, because you could always have it worse. Don't be in a state of constant self pity, because it wouldn't take long to see someone else that has things much worse. I'm sure some of you have had a rougher time in life than I ever had, or could even imagine. 

Dark humor is something that I truly embrace now. Some will say that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I disagree. You can't take life too seriously, you just have to roll with the punches. 

Today I'm thankful that I'm alive, breathing, and able to see the world with two eyes and a healthy body and mind. 

Be your own hero, and aspire to be the type of person you wanted to be as a kid. Use your past trauma to mold you into what you want to be.

Create something beautiful out of your tragedy.

Please share your thoughts and insight, I'm always open to listen and learn. Maybe you'll help or inspire someone else that might come across this and read it, who knows."
1,"Isolation Post Breakup - Brings Back Old Feelings of Hoplessness.. My own company is my worst company. Im sure a lot of people here are feeling the impact of this. I can't forget my problems by going to work, I have very few friends and none that I'm connected with in such a way that I can talk freely about my headspace, and living alone intensifies everything. 

For some background, I was diagnosed with pure O OCD, and PTSD from a number of things happening in a space of 12 months (nothing overly dramatic; a breakup, pet dying then mother dying). I regularly find my mind spinning back into old habits, intrusive thoughts batter me and I'm left empty, broken and full of loathing for myself.

I had a breakup a few weeks before the quarantine started, and I've picked this old mental scab until it bled. I've acutely self aware, I really wish I wasn't. My recent ex was very interested in personality types, and through her I learned that I fit quite well into the INTP bracket, which makes sense.

I'm rambling; I just feel so alone."
1,"This might sound stupid, but what are easy things I can do to lessen my depression?. Obviously I have to change habits and fight through it but what are some interesting things you guys/gals have done that worked in helping depression ?"
1,"Why does she insist on fucking with me?. My ex, who already ruined my head, continues to fuck with me. I can't wrap my head around what it wrong with her.

She broke up with me because she was cheating on me (for the 3rd time) but she ended it in January. Yes, I know why didn't I end it a long time ago? I'm a push over and let her walk all over me. Even now I still love her even though I know she has some mental problems. It's been 3 months. 

She lied that I broke into her house (while she accused me of many other things, that was the one that got her enough to get a pfa against me, and I never got to tell my side of the story in court. Also, the name of the house is still in both of ours, and I allowed her to have the house for her and my daughter) but either a stranger did it, or the more likely scenario is her or her new scumbag boyfriend(who I don't trust around my daughter at all) did it to try to get me out of their 
 life so I couldn't pick up my daughter by myself and not allow me to grab my things from the house.  

Also, shout out to that boyfriend who tried to make fun of me for living with my parents. Hey, you dumb fucker, i just gave you a house to live in, that's still in my name, and that slut you are living with is the reason I had to move back in with my parents 

Anywho, when the pandemic started she and him decided to plan a flight somewhere, knowing full well what is happening in the world. She did finally cancel it after she got laid off and had the stay at home order in place. But she was already willing to risk her health and possibly come back sick to our daughter, just to be with her new shitty boyfriend. Because she doesn't care about our daughter.

Then last Thursday, she said she can't keep our daughter for Friday(which was the plan). Because she has ""plans"". Things are fucking closed, you shouldn't have plans for anything. So I kept my daughter for over 4 days because of her negligence. We had a deal to split our daughters time 3.5 days a week. Which I'm fine with.

NOW, today I find out she suddenly wants to keep our daughter until Saturday. 6 fucking days. When I was supposed to get her this Thursday. Of course I can't do anything. I can't talk to her and ask her why. She can only talk to my mom. So something is fucky and I don't even get an explanation. My mom won't ask her because she's tired of being in the middle. But I deserve to see my daughter. I actually love her and give her all my attention. Suddenly this neglectful person wants to spend time with our daughter? Doubtful. She's been fucking with me for years. And she managed to make a pfa happen so I can't even check in to make sure things are ok, to make sure my daughter is safe. She's breaking all this social distancing stuff because she has no care in the world. Because she doesn't care about anything. 

I've had depression for years, but since January, this shit is out of control. She's pressing buttons that's shouldn't be pressed. And everyone believes her because she is the mom, the girl, and I have no say over anything. And I don't know how much more I can take. My brain feels broken. And I want her to feel like I do. She deserves being mentally broken.

Maybe this rant deserves to go elsewhere, I don't know. But I'm a fucking mess right now."
1,"I’m so lonely. I want to do group video chats or zoom like everyone else but I have no one to do it with. I have two friends, which both live over 500 miles away. I moved states a few years back and lost basically all my friends. And out of my two remaining friends only one considers me a best friend or a close friend. And I tell myself that I’m going to tell her how awful I feel but I never follow through. She’s going through some shit and her problems are so much bigger then mine. I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want to be alone."
1,"Final fix. This is where it's all coming down, as my bottle falls to the ground, I look around with blurry vision, as my body spirals around. Desperation finds it's way in and this sinking feeling has me pinned, no time for resurrection it's in my head and I feel it winning. They're running under my skin, and I think I'm giving in, but it's all so worth it don't you see, the way that you'll keep saving me. So I'll keep chasing this high, while my eyes disguise these lies, and I can't escape because it's all over for me."

I’ve had experiences of being accused of rape and attempting suicide and a girl who I thought was the one breaking up with me for in her own words no fault of my own all last year. I think about ending my life daily but know it would hurt my mom and dad deeply and it’s the only reason I haven’t gone through with it.

I’ve talked to a therapist and have done counseling I don’t have family that I see often in America and don’t have people who care about me here and I’m getting to my breaking point, I don’t want to hurt my parents or sister but I don’t know what to do anymore

My headspace was “no one cares about me so why should i take care of myself”... Eventually, i beat my depression got the help i needed but I’m overweight. Not noticeably heavier but i’m not “fit” anymore. I feel miserable and it makes me feel like I might go down that dark path of feeling depressed again.

1,"Anyone else have issues with Walgreens delivery for meds?. I got an alert back on 4/2 to renew a delivery prescription. I never heard back via email or text on the status. I've been on the phone with them since Saturday, and depending who I talk to, I get different answers. I was told they were done processing and would be shipped over night. Then I was told they were out of one med. When I asked why I didn't get a notification of that, she said, ""We have millions of customers, we can't notify people."" To which I asked why Walgreens doesn't embrace automation like every other business. I got told a different story each time and I have devoted 10+ hours to this. At one point they told me I should just go to a local Walgreens and pick it up. Nope. I have at risk family members and signed up for delivery for this reason. 

I have no idea if I will ever see my meds and I will be going through withdrawals if I don't. I know delivery pharmacies are slammed right now, but denying people meds is criminal. I was rudely told they they are at least 3 weeks behind and I should have placed the order sooner (you can't refill sooner than a certain time so this isn't possible.)

Anyone else having problems getting meds?"
1,Thoughts before I get high. So I’m writing this while I’m waiting on my plug to pull up. So I’m very depressed and it’s been this way for years u would think after dealing with my depression for years I would be able to start handling it better but that’s not the case. There’s not really anything that can help me even when I smoke sometimes the bad thoughts come in. I just wish I ain’t have to smoke to be some what happy because like right now I’ve been sober for a day and the thoughts are so bad they feel like they actually hurt physically even in a good moment my thoughts will creep up on me. I just want to die I hope I catch the corona and welp just die. I just feel like death is the only answer I’m starting to think there’s nothing else that would help

1,"I feel like my depression is an illusion and I am just being a baby. I feel no acknowledgment of my depression, even after I tried to commit suicide, not even from my mom.
I have been taking antidepressants, but with this quarantine I am just down all the time, I feel so lonely and believe me, I have trying to reach out for ages, but after every attempt I feel disappointed, as if nobody gets it, nobody is there, even when it all comes to “cuddles in bed” days, I have nobody to cuddle with, nobody to share thoughts with, nobody to just sit there with.

I don’t know what to do, I am afraid of being alone in my head, I am afraid ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

Sometimes the only really relaxing though is that I can always end it all.

Loneliness is killing me.

1,"I've lost any motivation or energy for over a month and can't get up for most part of the day. I just moved out for college in January, my girlfriend dumped me after ignoring me for one or two weeks right after that. So that plus the loneliness of not being able to see my friends and not telling them because our relationship was kind of a secret turned into really bad first weeks of college. I was really sad and couldn't make any friends except for a girl who started talking to me.

I've had moderated depression for a couple years now, went to therapy for a couple of months last year but my mom couldn't pay for it anymore.

So I started college kinda bad but kept getting worse, I couldn't keep up with the work. I was happier because I made a friend, but just her. I really want to but all the time I think people are just nice and they like me but just not enough to want me around. 

The second week of March I was at my worse ~~yet~~. I needed to finish a paper so didn't attend to biology lab, couple of days later didn't do the work needed for chemistry lab, so I lost that practice too, next day, turned on an incomplete homework, even when I had all the answers. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

Right after that quarantine started and I came back home, now with online classes. But since then, I have started getting worse and worse, I do less work than I did before, I can't get up of the bed, I can't bring myself to do anything, can't sleep either. I just don't want anything but disappear, I'm not even sad, I just feel empty and lonely.

It may look like I'm just lazy or irresponsible, but I really feel something is happening to me to be this bad.

I'm seriously thinking I need help as soon as possible, I have tried to start by myself but is just not enough to keep up with school."
1,"No escape no hope. My depression is situational. Im 28 i have a baby and my main goal and dream is to move out and be independent. But im stuck with my parents and they arent making it easy. 

My mom i feel uses me as a bank. So i got my refund. She asked for 500, another 500 and more and more until I had absolutely nothing.. Then she needed 300 to turn the cable on and I sais ok but i needed it back. Even the the woman over the phone said it was sweet of me to give the mo ney but my mom had a problem of me asking for it back and had an attitude and basically threw the money at me. 

My dad just made the situation worse saying she doesnt appreciate you and stop letting them walk all over you. My dad then took my accessories off the key of the car my mom and me got and threw it on my bed. My mom basically took over the car.  Bc i was working bc of maternity leave my dad accused me of laying up on my mom but before then i always paid the insurance until i couldnt. 

Even when i was in college with every refund I had i always gave my mom 600 always. 

Back to the tax refund she wanted me to give my bro an extra 300 ( gave him 1k for letting me stay with him)i said no bc i dont have that much left and she started shouting and threatened to leave me at my brother's and take the car... 

Then both of my parents talked abt me loudly in my presence to friends or fsmily members..

Just recently my dad accused me of being a bad parent when i had my son laying on his back for half a sec and he cried while i went to get clothes to get dressed. 

Then said youre gonna be on welfare forever and the night before i saw a woman wearing a nice blouse anf my dad said I cant wear that bc I havr a stomach and the day before that said I still looked pregnant. 

My mom said she wish she left me at my brothers.. And i just dont know what im doing wrong except existing. 

Im not even looking fwd to my stimulus money.. My mom already factored in 500 from my stimulus but ofc shes gonna ask for more. 

Ive been looking for work and been turned down each time due to this virus... 

I just feel like id have to deal with their crap forever. 

I never get lucky like my friend that got a good paying job in the midst of this pandemic and has a good hub that works.. 

I also have hpv anf got lucky enough to get not one high risk strand but 2. 16 and 18 that cause cancer. 

I have no friends. Never had. Lonilness is the theme of my life.. 

Idk i want it to end. I kind of thought of a good way to go. I just feel I have no one. No one at all.  To help me through my issues.  Im just like man what if i had ppd?  I would have killed myself for sure desling eith all of this. 

Idk just hopeless. Ill never leave my parents. 
No opportunity is opening up for me."

I only did two months because I’ve been going through anxiety about doing group work but was nervous and I got paranoid easily. I’ve been in therapy for my social anxiety and general mental health stuff since October. I was looking for work than COVID-19 came and my plans got hold back. My mom bought me plane tickets to go to Colombia in August with her to spend a month there. Hopefully we can go due to this pandemic but now it’s look it’s what the future holds for me for the next few months and after I return from Colombia in September. With this pandemic, I don’t know what I want in life. I want to get better and stuff, but since I have no work experience and basically dropout out of college in 2017.

I've had major depressive disorder for a number of years now, but I'm struggling lately in coming to terms with the fact that despite desperately wanting to I don't have a capacity to enjoy hobbies, activities, or people that I used to. It's a scary feeling of claustrophobia as if there's a concrete block between me and my experience in the world, and I can't connect with anything in a satisfactory way.

Does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement about this? The dissociation is scaring me. Without your hobbies, interests, relationships, etc - who are you? I feel like I can barely connect with things I used to confidently claim as part of my being, and that connection is getting even weaker all the time. I'm scared of being a shell and letting down the people around me who I can't meet halfway in their enthusiasm for maintaining closeness."
1,"The worst part about personal self isolation is knowing that you’re disappointing almost everyone around you.. By personal self isolation, I mean you’ve been having to self isolate regardless of world events.

Knowing that there are people out there who genuinely want to talk to me and get to know me is nice, but it’s also scary.

I can’t let them in because I know what I’m gonna do. I’ll just manipulate them, I’ll lie to them, I’ll create a completely false version of myself and present it to them, even adopting a whole new persona that fits in completely with their wants and desires just to have control over them.

But because I don’t want any of that to happen, I self isolate. I’m posting this right now because I have a coworker who’s been trying to get closer to me lately and try to get me to talk more and I try to let her know I’m not interested and more often than not, I end up walking out in the middle of her sentences. I really don’t know what to say because it feels like I’m going to hurt her either way, and she clearly hasn’t lost interest in me yet.

I can literally feel the disappointment from half of the people I’m regularly around because most of them were eager to get to know me but I shrugged all of them off. 

It’s also, ironically, the loneliness that bugs me about this. It makes it hard to continue to self isolate by choice, because deep down, I DO still want to try to have a real connection with someone, but it’s impossible, and I get trapped in this infinite loop of hopelessness and dread."
1,"What is wrong with me ?!. Lately I have been feeling quite low of myself. I m an Indian and proud to be one. My parents both look totally Indian and they even belong to the totally Indian regions but due to unfortunate circumstances, I do have some Asian traits. Sometimes I feel I m adopted but there are a number of traits that match. And these traits sometimes feel like coincidences but I know they aren't. The main problem is because of some Asian looks, I m teased a lot on the looks and I know it's the stupidest thing to feel but I can't help not acknowledging why I look like this. 
And idk if it has to do anything with this but lately I m enjoying a lot of Japanese indie bands and this keeps me more in this thought, "" m I really the person I think I m ?"".
This thought makes me really lonely sometimes, which affects my performance. I m not even able to share this with anyone, not even my mom, because what if I share it to someone and he/she didn't think this way but he/she starts to think like this. Fear has taken control of me totally.
PS btw asian look isn't something to be ashamed of, I m because for totally personal reasons and these things should not affect anyone else"
1,"Corona is really hurting my mental health. My son is stuck in Ohio with my mom. I got out of the military and moved to N.C. for college. I got an apartment in February and the navy finally brought my stuff in March right before things started shutting down. Due to listing my house and waiting on furniture my son had to stay with my mom. My sons sperm donor can’t have him for overnights until he does a drug rehab program. And i didn’t think it was fair for my son to be crashing between places while I waited for things to fall in place. 
Now he’s stuck in Ohio till this virus is over. My family was posting Easter pics. He’s 2 now and last Easter he had so much fun getting eggs. It’s the first holiday I haven’t been able to go up there and see him. I’ve been to depressed to finish unpacking. I lost my job but luckily I have benefits that I’m able to use to pay my bills. But it’s stressful. I just want my baby back, the sooner this virus ends the sooner he can come down. 
Last week I reached out to the veterans crisis line and talked to someone through text. Lately I’ve been wishing I could just go to sleep till this blows over. I don’t want to exist but I don’t want to die. Also can’t get into Veteran’s mental health till the end of May. I just want to talk to a specialist but I have to wait and it sucks. 
One of my friends is a specialist but I don’t want to just use her since she has actual patients paying her. I did have a chat and she helped me realize my ptsd “diagnosis” (not confirmed my an actual mental health doc just my pcm) is actually cptsd. I was telling her the symptoms and she was able to guess it was my sons father that caused them. I feel like I’m going through this alone. 
I told my mom and family through Facebook messenger. My dad messaged my mom and said it was bullshit and I’ve had the ptsd symptoms since I was a kid. 🙄 but doesn’t have the balls to actually message me about it. I havnt found a good time to talk to my boyfriend about it. He doesn’t talk to my ex husband anymore but they use to be friends and it’s weird. I want to talk to him soon but he’s also been moody lately as well. He’s been working more as a cyber security person from home than he has at work. 
We’re all stressed."
1,What do I do with my life?. This quarantine period has been beating my mental health like a jackhammer to a piece of rock. I miss contact with my friends and I cant even sleep without crying. My friends are the only people I feel super emotionally safe with and I cant even be with them. I think the worst part about not being with them is that I think I'm forgetting how they look. Life seems so dull and pointless all the time now and I just dunno how much longer I can keep this going. I feel like shit all the time and I hate it. I got animal crossing and that makes me feel a little better but only very briefly because I end up remembering that I'm so distanced from my friends that I have to resort to videogames for any source of happiness at all. Anyways that's all I needed to say.
1,"Depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home, but no matter where I am, I am never home. Even when I’m at my physical home.. It’s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. I’d feel better if i was at this place. Then you go there and then it’s the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. 

I feel mentally homeless and I just want to go home.


Edit: I didn’t think this would get traction and that’s my first gold. Thanks buddy."
1,"Depression is so much worse if you live with your parents.. I can't hide, I can't cry out loud, they don't understand me if I can't clean my room or can't go out. They watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens."
1,"Shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression.. This is me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than don’t-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that’s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time."
1,"A stranger just saved my life.... I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 "
1,"I was going to kill myself tonight. I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my “last meal” while listening to Bob Marley.

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We’re planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don’t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn’t kill myself.

Edit: thank you for the gold, friend:)

Edit: thank you for the silver, friend:) I’m currently sitting at a coffee shop, reading all the kind messages everyone has sent. It means a lot to me"
1,"Does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?. Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don’t know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I’m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i’m hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i’m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. 

Edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely."
1,"Living with depression is like running a marathon with a broken leg and then having everyone run past you and say “Yeah, yeah, broken leg boo-hoo, we’re all tired.” And then run the same fucking race everyday. The cycle.. You’re depressed!

You’re okay, it’ll take time, but you’re okay!

What the hell is taking so long, life blows, you’re depressed again!

You woke up and got dressed today, it’s looking up from here?

SIKE, you fucking idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? You’re dumber than you lead yourself to believe!

Okay, we’re okay, we’re gonna make it. I just gotta stay strong.

Oop, you fucked up once today, I’m dragging your ass back into the dark. 

OVER AND OVER AND OVER! 

Is there really only one way out? I don’t know if I wanna die, I got a brother who may need me one day. I’m tired. So tired, man."
1,"If 10 years ago someone told me that in 10 years I would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat, sleep and use my phone/pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks, I would never believe them. But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that."
1,"The worst thing is realising no one is coming to save you and you have to rescue yourself with zero motivation to do so.. I imagine these ridiculous scenarios in which I somehow get 'saved' from my depression by others. Like an intervention where someone comes and tries to save me.


 But now my mind is clear. No one is coming to save me. It is up to us.



But how can you mend yourself when all you want to do is destroy yourself?"
1,"Depression is the fear of failure, coupled with no urge to be productive. It is want to have friends, but not wanting to socialise. It is wanting to be alone, but not alone. It is feeling everything at once, yet feeling numb to everything.. There is never a comfortable place in depression or a constant state, it is always a state of not knowing or wanting anything, but what state is that? It's so self-absorbing, everyday feels the same. It feels very weird at times, feels very disconnected from the world and realisation of that just brings me down. Every thought and decision is a battle, and the only escape tends to be sleep. Waking up feels like a mistake.

The worst thing about depression is that it takes away time from you that you will never get back. You cannot see hope and only fog, it feels like living itself is a prison sentence. What makes me feel even more guilty is that as I do nothing, there are people out there who want to live, who are dying. But me, I would love to disappear. What holds me back? I don't want to be the reason of grief and sadness for others."
1,"""Depression isn't always at 3am when you're alone with only the thoughts in your head. Sometimes it's at 3pm, when you're surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing."" This is high functioning depression. So many people don't get it.. I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to."
1,"High-functioning depression: I feel like I'm living a double life.. I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape."
1,"I cried in front of my family today. They ended up comparing their issues to mine and tell me that other people have it worse.. Thank you, that really helps. Now I feel ten times worse."
1,"Does anyone else feel normal one minute then wish you were dead the next?. I feel decent. I'm watching YouTube or I'm just browsing the internet and all of a sudden my mind is like: ""Everything in life requires effort and I'm way too exhausted to try. I have a long life ahead of me but it's too much of a bother. I don't want to live.""

Even if I'm feeling optimistic about my future and, ""what if everything really does work out the way I want it to?"" I feel like it's way too tiring to live the life I want and all I want is to sleep and do nothing.

Everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and I don't want to do it. I think if I knew that I would inevitably drop dead in 10 years then I would feel a bit more motivated, but just knowing that it's likely that I'll have to wait 50 more fucking years before I might finally drop dead is like a giant weight on my shoulders."
1,"Does anyone else get extremely bummed out seeing people younger than them doing more with their life?. I hate being told: ""It'll get better when you're older."" No it fucking won't. I've waited for over a decade for things to get better & they haven't. It's especially not true when I see people younger than me living better, happier, & more interesting lives. Clearly that means I'm a failure & I just can't properly do this game we call life.

Just today someone I know who's younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their SO. I can't do that now & if that doesn't scream that I'm a pathetic loser, I don't know what does."
1,"Do any of you feel like you're lying or being melodramatic every time you try to talk about your mental health?. I think I may have depression, but I find it so hard to talk about, because every time I try I feel like I am just making something out of nothing. I can write out 5 messages to a friend but never send them because everything I write feels like a lie.

I managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now, then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like I was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them. They were so supportive but I shut it down. Now I feel even more like I am just being melodramatic or attention seeking."
1,"I want to be alone, but not lonely. I want friends but hate socializing. Want success, but have no desire to be productive. I’m lost in my own conscience.. Thank you all for the supportive messages. It’s heartwarming to know that I’m not alone. I know we can all get through this together. I love each and every single one of you "
1,"Does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day?. I don’t know if that makes sense. What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it’s destroying me, I’ve been doing this for months and I’m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. And they always seem to get their way. 

Edit: I’m really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing I’m not alone. Sending lots of love to you all. This isn’t easy but I believe in you ❤️"
1,"I wouldn't commit suicide but if I had an option to suddenly stop existing I would choose it. Does anyone else feel this way?  This has been crossing my mind a lot lately

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving.  It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it.  You guys are the best.  :)"
1,Had anyone noticed memory decline from depression?. Just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline. Or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level.
1,"My therapist died. She was only 67. She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further"
1,"does anyone else have a constant feeling of not fitting in or belonging anywhere?. i feel this way around everyone, friends, family, coworkers, anywhere i go. i just always feel like i’m in the background. but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don’t have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight.."
1,"The worst part of depression is waking up and the first thought that pops in your head is how shitty you feel, alone and already struggling to get through the day before it’s even started.. I can’t even remember the last time i woke up excited for anything.

edit: Wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and sharing your own stories. Definitely glad to have this community it helps to know we aren’t alone even though it may feel that way."
1,"Do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred. Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
1,"Does anyone have a period where they feel really motivated and see things clearly, only to crash even harder the more you try to better yourself, feeling even more depressed than you were originally?. It feels like the harder I try to better myself, the harder it pushes back."
1,"Anyone else ever feel like the “old you” died years ago, and now you’re just limping along as someone you really can’t stand?. Like, the old me wasn’t even that great either but damn "
1,Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?. I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?
1,"Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life. I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"
1,When you realize that you have an incredibly easy life but you’re screwing It up for yourself. My life is objectively very easy but my depression makes it all feel like a struggle
1,"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.. I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. 

Also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)"
1,"I wish I could say ""I was depressed"" the same way I say ""I was sick"" to explain my absence. I'm so tired of making excuses. I am sick, just in my head."
1,"Does anyone else get really happy and motivated for a few hours to a few days, just to fall off the edge again?. It feels like I'm on a rollercoaster with 80% super lows and 20% kinda highs.."
1,"After 1 suicide attempt, and one overdose, I GRADUATED!!!!. I MADE IT. FUCK EVERYONE WHO PUT ME DOWN. FUCK THE BULLIES, FUCK THE CLIQUES, I DID IT. But more importantly, THANK YOU to everyone who kept me going. It brings me to tears thinking about how thankful I am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when I was down. I feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. To all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!


Edit: wow thanks for all the awards, love, and support!"
1,I miss myself. I miss when I was happy and life wasn't pointless.
1,"The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality. My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better."
1,"Imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it. That's what getting help for depression looks like to me.. I'm discouraged today! :D 

Edit: This is a bit overwhelming. But reading all your comments was lovely. I hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day ❤️"
1,"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".. But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"
1,"Alive, barely.. I wrote a suicide note today. 

I listened to funeral music.

I lined up all my pills.

I cried. And cried more.

I thought of my mom.

I thought of my dad.

I thought of Ang.

I thought of Paulie.

I thought of Kris.

I thought of everyone.

I thought of soldiers in war.

I thought of terminal illness.

I thought of my possible future..

I remembered what I'd be losing.

I felt a rage grow in me.

I put away my pills.

I listened to angry music.

I didn't kill myself today."
1,My therapist finally convinced me to start getting out of the house and this shit happens.. I'm never going to get better why the fuck should I even try.
1,"I can overhear my mother on the phone laughing and joking about my depression to her friend. Saying things like “she’s so emotional hahaha” and telling her friend everything I just said that was making me upset.

Everything about me is just a joke to her, just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over.

I don’t even know why I’m crying, what else should I expect from someone who hasn’t ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support."
1,"Keeping in touch with friends is so hard when your brain tells you no one wants to talk to you. I have one friend I text regularly. Everyone else I either think they don't like me or I don't like them.

As an introvert by nature this is so dangerous as I end up in a lonely depression spiral since my tendency is to want alone time, but not alone time all the time.

EDIT: well with this many upvotes, I guess I don't feel as alone. Hope everyone is doing ok tonight."
1,"After I revealed I’ve had depression for a very long time, a co-worker told me today that I am the most positive and uplifting person at the office to talk to but she’d known something was wrong because of my eyes.. “Your face lights up, your smile is infectious, but your eyes always look like you’re staring at a freight train while you’re standing on the tracks in front of it.”

Man if that didn’t fuck my shit up for the rest of the day"
1,"It’s not that I want to kill myself. But if I die I wouldn’t be upset.. I don’t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to die. It’d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn’t right to think like this but I can’t stop.


Edit: this blew up, it’s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I’m home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there’s this much support in the world."
1,"Has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression, but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience?. I found that a lot of times in the past I would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that I was already “trying” to do and then I panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. It’s hard to open up about it when I’m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, MEMORY LOSS and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating... 



*For not from depression, sorry"
1,"I almost killed myself today. I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.

To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that. I know but I’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life."
1,"When I’m sitting on my ass doing nothing, I feel useless and depressed. When I’m actually doing something, i think about how I’d rather be just relaxing at home. Just a loop of unhappiness, really hope I can fix it soon.  I wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life."
1,"Do you ever feel that the deeper in depression you are, the dumber you become?. Today I was feeling extremely low. I don't know but my I feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased. I'm just so angry and irritable. I hate this feeling"
1,"A Depressed persons vocabulary ""I'm fine"" ""Im okay"" ""nah I'm just tired"" ""it's not a big deal"".. what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad? or when your being moody because your sad?"
1,"Does anyone else find it increasingly hard to pretend to be a normal functioning human being?. My only social interaction is at work but it's getting harder to pretend I'm a normal functioning human being. Haha sports, family, friends, hobbies, ambition, future, yeah I totally love them haha I am a normal human being that has things that normal beings enjoy too haha I am normal too haha"
1,"When I don’t have a job, I want a job. When I have a job, I don’t want a job. When it’s hot, I want it to be cold. When it’s Fucking cold, I want it to be hot. When I’m myself I want to be with people, when I’m with people I want to be by myself. Do you guys see what I’m saying here. I’m always constantly completely bullshitting myself 24/7. I always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then I get them and I want the opposite. Complete self destruction and all "
1,"Too depressed to be productive, and not depressed enough to kill myself. I lowkey wish I can be pushed over the edge so I'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)"
1,I feel like I’m addicted to depression.. Whenever I feel sad I don’t try to cheer up I try to make myself sadder because I like it more. I feel addicted to isolating myself from others and there’s a small part of me that enjoys feeling depressed and isolated. Depression feels strangely comforting at times. Does anyone else have this issue?
1,"An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities. This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence."
1,"the worst thing about depression,is seeing everyone around you progress in their life and you are stuck in the same place. its like when you are playing videogame and you get stuck on some part of mission,while others are having fun,you are having the worst time in ur entire life"
1,"I feel like I'm getting stupider, less talented, clumsier, and that soon I will be completely retarded.. As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
1,Anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare. It makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again Weird post lol sorry
1,"Today I woke up and didn’t want to die.. After bordering on suicidal yesterday, I was surprised to find I had the motivation to get out of bed when I woke up this morning. The first thing I did was make my bed, and that’s a victory in my book. 

I love you all.

Edit: Thank you for the Silver, and for the heartwarming comments. It means a lot!

Edit 2: This has me all kinds of emotional. I’ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers."
1,"Fun fact: when I was younger many people told me I was a gifted child of above average intelligence.. WELL I SURE SHOWED THEM, DIDN'T I?

I'm a massive fuckup. I forget things the minute after I am told them. There's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. My grammar has devolved into caveman-speak.

I dunno if I blame my mental health or if I'm just stupid."
1,"Anyone else barely hanging on to life with no motivation whatsoever?. Too much of a coward to kill myself, but at the same time have no reason to live. I just need to know that I’m not alone who feels like this in this hour."
1,"Anybody feel like you died long ago, and you're just a zombified shell?. I just go through the routine every day, and kinda let everything just pass by. I don't really have much of an emotional response to anything, and my personality feels like a mush of stuff. Like, whenever things go wrong, people say they want to die, and while, yeah, I don't like what happened, I just feel kinda... neutral."
1,"Is anyone else hating the fact that they’re wasting time of their life as you’re witnessing it all go in the drain because of their stupid mental illness holding you down?. It’s so stressful. There’s so many things I want to do but I just can’t at the moment and it sucks. Theoretically, I could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if I wasn’t paralyzed and living my regular depressed life. Watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you’ve kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me."
1,Do you ever get so empty you’re excited when you finally start crying because at least you’re feeling an emotion?. I’ve felt empty for days and just now cried a little. Even though I’m miserable I was almost happy. It’s worse to feel like you’re dead than being sad.
1,"I don’t live for myself anymore, I only live so my mom doesn’t have to go through the pain of me committing suicide. I wonder how much longer I can continue like this"
1,"Mom died last night going to be needing all your love and support.. My depression has been doing so good, I’m so proud. But my mom passed away last night of pulmonary veno occlusive disease. Really needing positivity in these trying times. Thank you so much <3"
1,"anyone else get super motivated at night to get your life together, then when it's daytime that motivation is gone?. i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day. "
1,"Anyone been depressed for so long they don't even know if they are depressed or if they are just really boring?. I don't know if I'm depressed or if I've just lost my personality and identity. I don't know if this is me now or what? 
I'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage I'm going through, yet here I am. All my friends are still themselves I'm completely fucking different"
1,FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. ITS TOO FUCKING STRESSFUL ICANF FUCKING DOI THIS IM GOONG TO MAKE THE WRONG DECISIONS AND REGRET IT I CANT DONIT IM SO FUCKING STRESSED OUT IM GOING TO DO MAKE THE WRONG DECISION AND END UP HATING MY LIFE AND WANT TO DIE AND FUCIUUCKF CUK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKF CUKF CFCK FUCK FUCK FCUK FUCK FUUUUUUCK FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKK FFUUUUUUUUUCVCKKKKKKKKKKF FFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FCUUUUKK’nnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1,"The reality of depression: Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine.. This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building.  
So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone. Life isn't worth the pain."" My reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there."
1,"Do you ever doubt the validity of your depression? And just think that the reason you can’t do normal things, is just because you’re a bad person?. My depression has depression bro. A lot of the time I doubt that I have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. 
I hope this isn’t just me. Like deadass, I don’t know if I’m the only person who feels like this. And if I am that’s just gonna scare me."
1,"I’m a Christmas person, but this year I’m just... empty.. I’ve felt better these past few months. A lot better, great even. But this Christmas it’s like... I can’t bring myself to care for the Holidays - and it’s my favourite Holiday. I can’t explain it. 

My family lives two hours away and I almost didn’t go, just because I wanted to be alone in my apartment, doing absolutely nothing. But I’m a single child, my parents are single children, all my grandparents are dead - it’s just us three. They’re getting old, too. I couldn’t just *not* go. They would have been so sad and I don’t want that.

But I’m just empty and miserable and it’s Christmas so I have to put up a front, a nice dress and be nice.

Gosh this is hard.

Merry Christmas.

Edit: wow, you guys know how to make someone feel special and a little less alone. Thank you, kind strangers! ❤️"
1,"Fuck this shit dude, how in the hell is anyone supposed to keep up with scjool, work, social life, healthy eating + exercise, and hobbies?. I'm so fucking done with this shit. I've had multiple exams this week all during my colleges green beer day fesitivies, which I've had to skip due to studying. Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this? What the fuck is the point. Sorry for ranting. Fuck this week. Been shit. Anyone want to talk? I need a study break I wanna help some people, maybe do some good in this fucked world. Love all of you "
1,"Absolutely nothing interests me anymore. I fucking hate it.. I literally don’t want to do anything at all. It doesn’t bring me any happiness or joy or whatever. At best, just distracts me from feeling shitty. Absolutely nothing helps. Video games, writing, reading, doing photography, drawing... none of that makes me happy.

It’s the absolute fucking WORST. I don’t even feel like sleeping, but I don’t wanna be awake either. I go to bed before 7pm because I have nothing else I wanna do. All I do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry, then I go to sleep, wake up and repeat.

I hate living. I hate this existence. I wish I could just die in my sleep.

EDIT: This got a lot more attention than I thought so I just wanna day that I’m reading all your comments and I love you all"
1,"Nobody gives a fucking shit about you until you mention killing yourself.. This world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit. Nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness. It's blatantly obvious. Fuck this.

Edit: This post isn't about me, it's about other people."
1,"i’ve just started answering “no” when people ask if i’m okay. i’m just tired of being someone i’m not
 
fuck everything"
1,"I shouldn't have to lie about my depression to get a sick day. But I do. Every time. Because saying ""I threw up everywhere last night"" gets you a ""Oh sweetie, take the day off to rest, it's okay!"", but saying ""My depression is acting up really badly and I just can't do it today"" gets you a ""Don't be lazy! Everyone gets sad, suck it up and come into work!"".

I shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. It's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.

Fuck that shit. We need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general."
1,"My girlfriend cheated on me with one of my best friends while I was at the psych ward for trying to kill myself. Someone please cheer me up. So this happened about 5 months ago but I found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me. We had been dating just about a year and I genuinely loved her with all my heart. I trusted her so much and she knew I have severe depression. I cant understand how another human can be that shitty. Anyone willing to talk?


EDIT: just found out she cheated on me with another guy too. She's completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated. Back to feeling terrible again, just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good :')"
1,Anyone else get lost in their daydreams and get hit with a wave of depression when you snap back to reality?. I spend so much time thinking about how I wish my life was that I can’t face the actuality of where I am.
1,"I deleted my note!. I had a long, very long suicide not stored in my phone, just waiting, and yesterday I deleted  it, i know it it’s not a huge step, but I feel ultimately better!

Update- I didn’t expect this to blow up, I posted it because I couldn’t believe I had finally done it; and I had felt so good, I’m trying to say thank you to everyone who commented, thank you to whoever gave me gold, you’re the best, and you all are amazing. Thank you!

Update 2- to everyone saying I inspired them to delete theirs, I cannot comprehend how good that made me feel that I helped to inspire you guys, I am so proud of every one of you. Thank you for all the love and support. I’m blown away and feel incredibly uplifted right now."
1,"Sleeping is the only activity I don't hate because it's like a free trial of not existing. Dreaming is also a bonus. Sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time."
1,Does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression?. I always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and I've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head. So many things piss me off. I sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger. It's led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and I don't know why I push them away
1,"Why I stopped opening up.. ""Bottling emotions is extremely unhealthy. You know, you can talk to me about anything.""

*dumps brain onto poor unsuspecting soul*

""Wow, you should talk to a therapist about that. I believe in you though!""

Edit: Thanks for all the supportive comments. To those suggesting I not open up to people who don't get it, I completely agree. This has happened to me when opening up to people who used to be very close friends who don't really have the time for me anymore. I'm not just dumping my brain on anyone who asks."
1,"How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?. I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that...  so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Edit: wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again."
1,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?. A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."
1,"Does anyone else sleep a lot to escape the pain?. I sleep so much. I enjoy it because it’s an escape without death. I don’t want to die but I don’t enjoy living, so I sleep. It’s a way of “living” without actually having to live. Sigh. If I could stay in bed all day and sleep, I would."
1,"I'm breaking apart and no one gives a fuck.. I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.

Keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else WILL use them to hurt you."
1,"Suicide ice cream. I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible

1,"I’m killing myself [update]. So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”"
1,"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling.. I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."
1,"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself"". I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. 

Anyone else do this?"

I am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were, but I don't see it in myself and I can't live up to those expectations put upon me. In middle school I got lazy and relied on my ""intelligence"" too much. Now I i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive 10 year old self thought that I was somehow special or above average. Now in almost everything I score below average and can't keep up with others. Its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years. now as everyone else is just about to graduate, its not even clear if I even will graduate.

1,"Anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something ""fun""?. Like I'll be out trying to enjoy myself and I'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but I still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling.

I hate this."
1,"Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.. Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn’t the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it’s been years and I’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I’m proven wrong.

Edit: it’s been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments. Those of you who commented or will comment I see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together."

My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way."
1,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it. We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
1,"Anyone else feel like their ""fake depressed""?. it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know. 

EDIT: Hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. If anything it's slightly comforting to know that

EDIT 2: Yes i'm aware of the spelling mistake in the title, it's kinda hard to spell correctly when you're rambling at 11 pm"
1,"Anyone feels jealous and bitter that you’re stagnating while everyone around you is moving forward?. As much as I wish people the best, I have to fight feelings of bitterness and jealousy all the damn time. I wanna know how to better cope with these feelings."
1,"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident. I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun."
1,One of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where you're genuinely happy then waking up to reality.. This happens to me a few times a year. It's like my brain is teasing me.
1,"My 17yo lovebug doesn't remember me anymore. So my cat apparently got alzheimers and it's breaking my heart... All the things we have been through, he has been there for me like no other person in my life has, all the play and joy, hardships, running in and out to the vet, petting him and loving him, waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing, following me downstairs and watch me make coffee... and now, all that is gone. It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore.. I am so sad right now I don't know how to think positively about the future without him. I feel completely shattered.."
1,"Does anyone else get random moments of clarity where you think ""oh crap, I'm actually very mentally ill."". Had one of those today. It feels like, for just a moment, I understand that I am indeed suffering from an illness. It's such a strange contrast from constantly thinking ""You're not actually sick, you're just a terrible person.""

Anyone else experience something similar?"
1,"I wish I could have a fatal accident instead of committing suicide.. I want to die and leave this black hole of self hate and overwhelming sadness. I have a wonderful husband and two amazing teenage boys, and yet I find no joy in life. 
I don't want to commit suicide and scar my family that way. I just hope every day that I'll have a fatal heart attack, stroke, or get hit head on by a semi."
1,Why the fuck does being alive always have to feel like an uphill battle. I can't fucking ever keep up.. I'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. To anyone or anything. I can't keep up with life I'm so fucking tired of it. Why do I always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. I feel like i was damned upon conception. I was fucked from the start. With my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions I was FUCKED FROM THE START. I never stood a chance here. Why the living fuck do I always feel like I'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. Sometimes I want to end my life so badly but I am too afraid to hurt my family. I keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that I am hopeless. I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.
1,"Just started therapy after 20 years of being depressed, then it gets postponed because of the pandemic. It's like my life is a sick joke or something, the one time in years that I finally want to get better, it has to get fucking postponed and I'm stuck quarantined at home, isolated and alone. What's the point anymore"
1,"Nobody cares if you're suicidal, only if you commit suicide. I have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that isn't just more of this roller coaster ride. The people close to me no longer show concern because that's just who I am to people now. They either don't know me, or they know how much I'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it. And that's the thing isn't it?  
  
**Nobody cares until you're gone.** Nobody cares until you can 'prove it'. We're 'attention seekers', except I've isolated myself from everyone and I don't communicate how I feel anymore to anyone but internet strangers who also don't know me and therefore don't care.   
  
Unless you're actually about to pull the trigger, people would prefer if you shut up, fucked off, stop bringing down the mood, stop being a burden, you're simultaneously too much and yet not enough.     
  
They don't care what's causing my misery. God forbid I mention a person, or people are the stressors to what I'm feeling. That is manipulation. Suicidal people are manipulative. We just latch on to people and bring them down.  
  
I'm sorry. I don't want to be this way. I have asked, pleaded, begged for help. Nobody has offered anything to actually help me. Throwing vague suggestions and hotlines and websites isn't help. Leaving me to figure out my own shit does not help.   
  
At the very least I have learned how to bottle most things up. Nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain. And eventually, hopefully soon, nobody will have to worry about me at all.
  

  Edit: I think a lot of people misunderstood. Nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggles. My mother is half the reason I have them, biologically speaking. We have similar symptoms. I've made it clear what kind of help I need and what I need help with to get there. I'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not as pressing of a matter as whatever else is going on.  This was also general observation of how people react to suicidal people."
1,"I'm getting more and more stupid.. For a while now I feel like I am getting progressively stupid. Information doesn't stick, common sense doesn't kick in and overall I really struggle following conversations and responding correctly. I'm always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things I've said, things I should of said, how slowly I've been to react to something and overall how useless I am. I feel like I'm turning into a sloth. My body is so heavy and every now and then I have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on because I've blinked and ten minutes has gone 
by. I don't recognise this mess that I've become and I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it? I'm miserable and what's worse I'm frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless. Help 😞"
1,"I’ve been diagnosed for 20 years - yesterday I quit my $100k+ high pressure sales job to become an 8th grade science teacher.. Yesterday I made the decision to make mental health my priority, after years of telling myself money can make me happy.  

Yesterday I decided to be happy.  

Thinking about you all.

Edit:  never received gold before, so thank you kind stranger.  
Also, to those saying teaching isn’t easy, no one said that it was easy.  Everyone has different personality traits.  Please remember this is a post celebrating mental health, and to instill hope in others. 

Edit 2:  another very large deciding factor - one of my best friends shot himself in the head on Christmas Eve 2017.  The impact is real.  "
1,"I had a personality once but now I can't remember who i am. J remember i used to be funny. I used to laugh and make jokes. I remember being able to hold a conversation with people. I wanted to know people and give back. I was shy but querky,  talkative and funny around people who knew me. 

Now I'm nothing. I don't seem to laugh or smile anymore. 

I feel numb and unsatisfied with everything I do.

EDIT: wow thank you everyone for your responses. I thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that I'm not alone. We just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. 


On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people. So much in fact that i start believing In  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me  and not leave. I just agree and comply with everything. I've done this for so long I just don't know who I am anymore."
1,"God dammit. I should be able to tell people I have suicidal thoughts sometimes without them freaking the fuck out. I feel like killing myself sometimes. There, I said it. Doesn't mean I'm going to do it.. I told my wife yesterday that I have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what I'm doing about it to feel better. Needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons I shouldn't and then went and told my mom without my permission. Guess I'm not telling her anything anymore. I'm in this shit alone."
1,"It gets better, but it never STAYS better.. I’m getting really sick of anti-suicide types saying “hold on it gets better”. Yes it does for brief moments, but happiness wears off eventually and you’re sent plummeting down. But we all have to pretend that just because we’re going to therapy, or are getting medicated, or have been through suicide watch our lives have improved substantially. That’s not how depression works. 
Saying that things “get better” is worthless. If suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, then “things getting better” is a temporary solution to a permanent problem. People need to stop pretending there’s a cure for depression. It’s impossible. Because I was born with depression, I’m essentially a human mulligan."
1,"Nobody talks about the memory loss. I have days where I feel like I'm being gaslighted or getting dementia. No told me when I was diagnosed about the memory issues. So if this is news to anyone here, you might be going mad but not in the way you think. Its just the shitty disease."
1,"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.. Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.  
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.  
&nbsp;

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

We just want to be heard, I guess. And we understand that about each other. Cheers, everyone. Wish you all the best of getting through your day."
1,"Woke up, realized it was Christmas, and broke down sobbing.. I just woke up an hour ago. I don't know why, but I always really struggle with Christmas. I started getting so sad that it was getting hard to breathe. The worst ideations I've had in a while. I almost blocked my fiance because my brain kept telling me that I'm a problem. Thank god my brother came in with the puppy and it snapped me out of it a bit.

Hope everyone is safe today."
1,"Does anyone else wish that you could sleep forever?. I'm NOT speaking suicidal.

I just like sleeping. Sometimes I get weird dreams, but slumber is a nice alternative to dealing with the stress/anxiety/depression."
1,"It’s my 25th birthday today. Even though I don’t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms— birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that I truly am alone.. Spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food. 
Even if friends were there to celebrate it with me I just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy. 
I’m always stuck in my own world of depressing obsessive thoughts and need to be left alone.
I don’t want to be left alone."
1,"I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead. If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

Edit: thanks for all the responses! Let me rephrase something here. I dont wish I had cancer. I wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. I'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes."
1,"Anyone else used to be bright in school, but now feel like a bum?. Sorry if my language sounds harsh but that's how I feel about myself now. Used to be a good student, not too bright but put an effort, dreamed to study in the West, teachers kept telling me I'd go places.

Now unemployed (only an unstable freelance job), living alone with no friends and no energy to pursue any hobby anymore. Play video games pointlessly, then sleep, usually with an empty stomach.

Such is life. Hope y'all doing ok.

Just to clarify, as long as you feel like a bum, it counts. Depression doesn't discriminate I guess."
1,"Anyone else just feel bored of everything?. I dunno. Nothing excites me anymore. I wake up and I don’t know what to look forward to. I’m not having any suicidal thoughts and I don’t think I ever will, but I’m really struggling to feel happy."
1,"Anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of “tomorrow” feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought?. I know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little, but this is different.

It’s just that knowing that I’m not going going to fall asleep and stay asleep, that I’ll wake up in the morning and have to do this all over again, is so soul sucking that I force myself to stay up as late as I can. "
1,"I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?. The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
1,"Anyone else feel like they can’t learn shit?. I’ve always been that kid that used to catch things fast,the one who’s been called smart compared to others at my age ,but now i just feel like i can’t really learn anything new,half of the time i just find myself hearing shit that goes through one ear and goes by the other,can’t remember shit that i just saw it 5m ago,sometimes i need to reed the same topic over and over again just bc i can’t focking process it right, fuck that

Edit:grammar

Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies guys i never  thought i would get so many replies for so many things i’ve been asking myself and i also learned  names of sensations i experienced that i didn’t know how to describe,  anyways thanks for all the support and help making me feel less lonely in this crazy world :)"
1,"Hate when normal people ask me what I've been doing all day and I have to lie.. Nothing ok, I lay in my bed depressed and slept till 6pm alright? Sorry I can't be normal and productive like you up at 9am with 50 friends. I'm a creature of darkness and death, you wouldn't understand my life you grew up with a happy loving middle class family. My entire life has been suffering and hate everything. I'm so tired of pretending I have a job and pretending to be normal. I'm exhausted."
1,"i'm not doing any better i just got better at hiding it.. instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.
instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.
instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.
instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all."
1,"Anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f*&# up sends you plummeting into the abyss again?. It does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ..."
1,I want someone to notice how not okay i really am. I feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. Call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. I just want  someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. I guess this is my cry for help.
1,It hurts realizing who you really are. It hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. Realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. It doesnt matter wether im here or not. It just breaks my heart to realize that.
1,"“I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone“. This quote by Robin Williams has destroyed me. I’ve realized why I hate being with people more than being alone, even if I’m smiling and having fun. 

*EDIT* wow, thanks so much to every single supportive comment. means more than the world to feel supported. to everyone suggesting social media is a cause of this- is not the case here. i don’t use social media, because I know the conversations on there don’t follow me to my grave ❤️ real life human connection does. today was a good day, thankyou everyone for your love."
1,"25, an aging, worthless failure. I have failed in nearly everything I had set out to do. I have no confidence to do anything else. 

I have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.

I'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. The people I grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. I am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that I am who I am.

I am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space"
1,I’ve been in quarantine in my head for 2 years. I’ve been stuck living in my head and it doesn’t seem like I’m getting out anytime soon.
1,"I am so tired of ""just taking it one day at a time"". There is always another day. And another. It never stops, no rest."
1,"I hate myself so much I actually repeat the phrase ""I hate myself"" to myself multiple times a day.. Especially when I think about all the terrible and cringey things I have done. Theres no getting around I'm a piece of shit so I feel better by accepting it."
1,I wish there was just an off button for life.. Suicide just seems so terrifying but living is so hard
1,Made a new friend. Today I noticed a girl at my school had a semicolon tattoo (;) and I showed her mine. We really clicked and exchanged phone numbers. I think I made a new friend😊
1,"I have no personality. Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? For me the downward spiral started when I was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all I remember. I don't know who I was before that, or who I am now. 

I always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person I'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality I fake for them. I can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. 

When I'm alone, I tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah I know it's weird) and then I feel like a blanc slate. Like there's nothing to me. 

This is my first ever post on reddit and I'm extremely anxious about it, but I've wanted to tell this to someone for such a long time and now I found this sub."
1,"I only have 2 friends but I hate talking to them because they have their life figured out and every interaction just makes me more depressed. I feel like I'm a child compared. They have their careers, hobbies, houses, happiness, everything, and I can't even stay up until lunchtime without falling asleep because I'm so drained of energy from just trying to survive these fucking torturous thoughts 

I'm bitterly jealous and I would rather lose them as friends at this point because it's just hurting me to be friends with them. I feel like I am 15 years behind them in my thinking and where my life is

I don't want to fucking struggle and work to ""make it"" in life, I hate it, and even if I wanted to, I have crazy anxiety, an attention span of 2 seconds, self sabotage every chance I get, and have 0 goals or interests"
1,Does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt. The worst part is now I have a girlfriend that I’ve dating for a while and I’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those I care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy
1,"Does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression?. When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied. It's like my life is so shit that if i'm not feeling overly depressed about it there is something off. Like I'm wasting time being ok or even happy. This might make zero sense, but it's a feeling I've had for so long."
1,"Did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience?. I was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later. I think about killing myself everyday, some days the thoughts are more active (with intention and a plan) and some days they're more passive. I look at who I used to be and get so sad. But I think ahead about the jobs and career choices, and I don't want to work in a cubicle 9+ hours a day for the next 40 years in a company that I don't give a shit about. "
1,"It's lonely.. I've been crying nonstop for 3months. Getting into university have made my condition worst. It's lonely here. I want to tell more but I just have no energy to type.

Hope those who read this.. good day to you.


Edit:
I didn't believe that my first post will get over 1K upvotes. Thank you for all the kind messages. Thank you. I have read all of it. Thank you. Truly made my day better. I will try to hold on and to those who are struggling too, keep your heads up too, try to love yourself, ourselves more. We can't lose hope."
1,"i don’t wanna kill myself, but i don’t want to necessarily exist either?. like, i wish that instead of having my crappy, depressing consciousness being tied down to my body, i could just exist as a floating, formless concept instead. right now my mind and body feel incredibly heavy and all i can do is lie down in the dark. i wish i could be free and light and weightless.

i don’t want to kill myself. i doubt i’d even have it in me to inflict physical pain on myself. but i don’t wanna exist like i currently do either. can anyone relate?"
1,"You ever wonder if your just faking it. Like you will feel sad all the time then happy for mere moment before your brain hits you with the"" damn bruh you were faking it for days"""
1,"Scared of sleeping because tomorrow will start. Lately I’ve been neglecting sleep because I can’t overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things i’m behind on whether it’s school or even socially. It feels like when i’m awake a long period of time I can just manage my stress. Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping.  Idk just feels like i’m trapped.

EDIT: I find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because I hate when people feel bad for me. I’ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but I always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems."
1,"Have you ever had to physically “fight” with your own mind just to keep yourself together?. I can not describe this better. Like I am literally fighting with myself physically so I do not lose touch with my surroundings and not get lost within my head.

It is so tiring.

Edit:

Damn, guys. I...am touched. I am just amazed to be honest how many of you struggle with the same shit every single day. Thanks for the kind words, for the support you show here. <3
You are all breathtaking. <3

Edit 2: I thought that this will be such an insignificant post. Turned out a lot of you feel like this. It is...sad and amazing at the same time."
1,Anyone else previously cared way too much and now is completely apathetic to everything?. Yup... that’s me. I think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and I don’t do anything at all and don’t accomplish anything because I don’t give a fuck and then I look back and so much time has gone to waste
1,"I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance. No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."
1,"Do you ever feel too ugly to leave the house?. Hair doesn’t style right, my makeup looks off, my outfit looks like crap. 3 hours of getting ready later....and I just cry and don’t end up going out. This is my life 90% of the time trying to go anywhere. I’m exhausted, and I hate it. Anyone relate?

Edit: Wow, by the likes it seems like I’m definitely not alone. Thank you for sharing. Sending you all well wishes that we can overcome this feeling and feel adequate, as I know we all deserve to feel accepted in society as we are. Hugs to you all 💜"
1,"Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older?. Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. "
1,"y’all ever just give up mid-day and zone the fuck out and start staring into space for prolonged periods of time?????. like i was at work and my body just shut down and decided not to try anymore so i just stared into space for what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually 30. fuckkkkk this"
1,"Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?. I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression."
1,"i want to tell people ""don't worry, i hate myself way more than you could ever hate me"". like if they are judging me or don't like me, trust me i know. i hate all of those things about myself and more."
1,"Do you ever just cry for the person you used to be?. Even with my chemical imbalance I used to be an active, social person. I was fun-loving and outgoing and for the most part happy.  Now it seems all I do is go to work, come home and sleep. I want to do things I used to enjoy but I’m so drained by just surviving. I try so hard but I can’t push myself to. It breaks my heart and I grieve for the person I used to be because I don’t feel like she’s even a part of me anymore."
1,"I fucking hate being depressed all the time. No, I'm in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry. But I am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good. I'm tired of having to remind myself that how I feel is not normal. I'm tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me. I'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today.  Every fucking day. I'm tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday. I'm tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole. 

Pardon the pun, but my depression is fucking depressing."
1,"You ever want to cry but, physically can’t. I’ve been wanting to cry for a few weeks now and it’s become hard for me to cry. I don’t know necessarily know why I want to cry. The other day I was watching Endgame and Tony’s death always gets me sad but, I couldn’t cry like I did when I saw it in theaters. I want to cry but I physically can’t. Why?"
1,"Does anyone else hurt so much emotionally that it feels physical?. It feels like i constantly have a negative feeling in my chest, that's constantly there all day, but feels like it gets way worse when I feel more lonely/sad/negative.

I've never hugged anyone before, so when i sleep i hug a really soft blanket I have, to feel at least somewhat better, but i always feel even more lonely and i usually cry, and I've noticed that feeling in my chest gets much worse when i feel worse emotionally."
1,You’re depressed because you’re not grateful. Today I got told that “You only get depressed because you aren’t grateful for the things that you already have.”
1,"Fuck me, I'm so tired of pretending.. I am always the guy making jokes and making people smile and helping them out. Truth is. I just use everyone as a distraction from my own shit life. 

I'm an introvert pretending to be extroverted."
1,"Somebody noticed I am not ok. Went to a doctor today because I suffered an injury while drunk.

The doctor (God bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if I was Ok. Actually pretty much told me I'm not Ok mentally. Asked what happened to me, how do I feel, why do I drink. Gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist.

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears.

Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs. They get annoyed with me if I don't wear my happy face, but I can not bear to put it on anymore.

God, I hope I can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself, because I can't live like this anymore."
1,"I don't want to kill myself but I just wish there was a way to stop existing.. I just want to stop existing, no one would have any memories of me, nor feel sad as they wouldn't have known me.

Is it so bad to say, I didn't ask to be here, my life is shit and hard, I'm very sad and I just don't like this ""life"" game. I just want to go back to my pre birth state of not existing."
1,"Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?. I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. "
1,"Today I brushed my teeth, took, a shower, exercised, vacuumed, played with my cat, stayed hydrated, and read a book.. Still want to die. Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. 

Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. 

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much. "
1,"I have no personality. I think I’m a very boring person. My personality is flexible and fragile. I easily change when I spend a little bit of time around someone. It’s hard to explain but imagine a chameleon changing its colors.

P.S Thank you for all the upvotes and comments!"
1,"I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live.. I’ve been feeling like this for about the past week or so now, and it’s been really bothering me. Ive been depressed for about a year or so and it’s getting worse. I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die. I feel like I’m stuck in a quasisuicidal state.I keep having the thought of just pressing a button that would just instantly take me out of existence. I fantasize about being asleep forever. I feel like I haven’t been myself for years. I feel like I haven’t been able to think straight and I’m constantly worried about tons of shit, but I don’t have enough motivation to do anything. Does anyone feel the same way? It would be great to know if other people feel like this.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies. I’ve been reading every single one, and it comforts me to know others feel the same way I do."
1,"I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help. I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?"
1,"I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."
1,"I survived my suicide attempt... Yesterday I had lost all hope and just went ahead and hanged myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so I can't be saved. As soon as I moved the chair under my feet I thought my neck would break cuz it was a high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts like a bitch. 

Half a min in I went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( I don't remember how long I did stay that way but apparently not long enough). 

Had a long talk with my parents and tbh I feel very relieved as if the past me did die, I'm motivated for once.

1,"i hate having to put away my feelings for 8 hours a day. go to school, put on a face, pretend that im all happy and nothing’s wrong. it sucks having to do this every single day. it’s so draining"
1,"Does anyone else feel like depression and anxiety ruined all their potential?. Now I'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. It's sad. It really is a travesty "
1,"Depression has made me dumber.. After years of struggling with depression and anxiety I've noticed I can't concentrate and process information as fast as I used to.

Does anybody else feel like this?"
1,"I CAN’T DO ANYTHING. MY BRAIN IS FUCKED

SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY BRAIN

I CAN’T DO ANYTHING

I CAN’T READ

I CAN’T SIT STILL

I CAN’T FUCKING FEEL ANYTHING

I CAN’T FUCKING DO ANYTHING IMPORTANT

I HAVE A SHORT ATTENTION SPAN

I NEED CONSTANT STIMULATION

I HAVE RACING THOUGHTS ALL THE TIME

I CANNOT FALL IN LOVE

I AM UNFIT FOR THIS FUCKING WORLD

MY BRAIN IS A SELFISH LITTLE BITCH

I’M FUCKING STUPID

I CAN’T DO ANYTHING RIGHT

I’M A FUCKING FAILURE

I NEED A NEW BRAIN"
1,"""I think the saddest people always try to make everyone happy because they know what it is like to feel worthless and don't want anyone else to ever feel like that"". Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head."
1,"Have you guys ever felt like doing something but depression just makes you stay in bed?. like if i wanna play some video game my brain will be like ''nah go to sleep'' and it really pisses me off, because i feel like im letting the days pass, and with this corona virus out there, if i die, i would've enjoyed the thing that i most love in this world, which is gaming."
1,"I just want to sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life with somebody.. While cuddling of course. 

Edit 1: I fucking love all of you

Edit 2: So many people in the US, no one is down under :("
1,"Depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment. I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. I am constantly worried about something going wrong. Lack focus and passion for what I do professionally and have no confidence in anything. I feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. Toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues"
1,I feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential. I always felt that I could have been something way better than I am now. I am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if I had done things differently.
1,"These random spikes of happiness and hope really fuck you up after. Nothing matters now.. You guys ever get outside, get that extreme spark of motivation like, “Fuck yeah! Things are looking up for me now. This world can kiss my ass because I’m gonna make it out of here!” Then, what feels like seconds later, something comes and rains shit on you. It’s like nothing ever lasts. When the fuck are people like us ever gonna get a break? Were shoveling shit all day, everyday and nobody fucking cares. But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass. You’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when I’m dead and gone. You think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. Good luck with that. I’m tired of being told to get help. With what fucking money? All just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because I’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? What the hell is the point of trying? I’m stuck here, just like I’ll always be. Just give me the freedom to take my leave. I’ll be happy then, but I’ll be decaying in the ground by then. Ironic, huh? 

I wish things were different."
1,"I miss the person I used to be. I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then. I still had things that made me happy, hobbies I enjoyed. And I actually had the motivation to do them! I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything.

But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely. I don't have any hope anymore, I don't have any motivation, I don't have anything to look forward to. And I just really fucking miss that part of me"
1,"I got my degree!!!. I'm so happy right now I completed my BA degree and I got a high mark for it overall. Those nights I stayed up paid off and I pushed through despite everything happening in my life. It was all worth it, I seriously doubted myself so many times but I did way better than I thought I would.

EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone I really appreciate it :)"
1,"Theres a part of me that wants to get better, but theres also a part of me that doesnt. its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time, i feel like depression is very comforting, even though its not supposed to be, can anyone give me ideas on what this is?"
1,Do you ever want a intimate relationship but know how fucked up you are so you just dont try?. I feel like they would run away or be disappointed once they get to know me. What the fuck am I going to do with myself? Maybe I'll doe alone lol
1,"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
1,You know something's wrong when you can't even muster the strength to play a fucking video game.. I just open up steam and endlessly stare at my library.
1,"anyone else ugly as fuck and wanna die?. i'm a really short guy, with an ugly face if I grow out my facial hair I look like a sick dog

i'm balding, my hair is thin 

my body is weak and scrawny, also my dick is small

everytime I catch my reflection on the subway I just want to vomit

I'M 27 but I look 47, also a KHV but this one goes without saying

people don't even see me, nobody can handle my no personality and social retardation

this is so unfair, and yes I wish I was born if africa at least I would've died at 8"
1,"Anyone else feel like they've lost their identity?. I used to be able to actually do stuff. Even if I didn't want to, I went to bed early. I got up in the morning. I had hobbies and sustainable goals. I worked on my problems and found solutions.

That was 6 years ago. Now, I want nothing but to get better, but I just keep being my own worst enemy. I want to get a job. I'm 23 and have absolutely no work experience. I paid $2300 last year to improve my grades and I still haven't read a single page. I want to, so why can't I just fucking do it? I have ADHD as well, but that's been with me my entire life so I can't really blame it on that..

I just have no sense of self anymore. I do the same thing every single day. I get up at noon, play video games, go to bed. There's just no productivity, even though I hate living like this. I always tell myself ""I can't take this anymore. I'll start making changes."" What do I do the next morning? Eat like shit and play video games all day.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I'm not strong enough to get up and make changes. Not consistently, at least. I see a therapist every 2 weeks, but I feel like he's starting to give up on me.

Absolutely FUCK depression."
1,"Today was my 21st birthday. I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
1,Anyone else wake up and mad they woke up?. Like every morning I think oh fuck this again. I can’t do this.
1,"I wanna stay depressed. Things are getting better but there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to be happy, like I wanna stay depressed."
1,"In your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person?. What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be.
So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that"
1,"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.. I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed."
1,"Addicted to Depression?. Is it possible to become “addicted” to feeling depressed? I’ve noticed i’ve almost used to as a coping mechanism, it kinda feels like a safe place, just cause since i’m like that most of the time, it feels “comfortable” or “normal”.

Edit- Thanks for all the votes and comments, i honestly thought i was the only one before. Makes me feel less strange, if that makes sense."
1,Do you ever wish you would accidentally die?. I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me. 
1,"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?. Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time."
1,I want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone?. So I’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I’ll stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I’ll think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I’m doing is complaining. I’m just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this? And if you have do you have any advice for me?
1,"Today I got a haircut, shaved, cleaned up my desk and walked the dog. Small step for a man but a giant leap for my mental health "
1,"So sick of hearing “you need to go out” and “put in some effort”. Go WHERE? I don’t like bars. I don’t like to drink too much. Especially if I’m driving. Where else do people go to socialize?? I don’t have friends or even know where to go to make friends. 

I try every opportunity I get it but I don’t get many opportunities because I have NO idea where to go socialize. 

I’m just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it. This makes me sad as fuck. :/"
1,"You wanna know the worst thing about depression (to me). It's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them. It's like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage (depression) locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them. I dunno but to me that's one of the worst things about it :p"
1,"Dae else feel depressed because everyone else your age is going out and living their life and you sit alone in your room every week.  People my age should be out living life and making memories but here I am feeling like shit in my room alone. Every fucking week it's the same shit. I just exist, I don't live. "
1,"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*?. I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. 
Anyway thanks for reading... What about you?

EDIT : Thank you everyone for replying, each and every one of you. I haven't answered to everybody. Sometimes I don't know what to say but I have read all the comments, I love you all.

P.S : I don't know what this silver plate is but, I guess, thank you kind stranger. I hope you are doing fine, all of you."
1,"You ever just run out of social energy?. You ever be out with someone, anyone, and you just run out of energy to be social with them and just wanna go back home really badly? Please tell me its not just me.

Edit: I just wanna thank y’all for taking the time out of your day to respond to this. Thanks guys."
1,"I wish I could donate my remaining years. To someone who can make a difference or at least someone who enjoys life. I thought I was getting better but this morning I found myself drafting a note in my head. I'll crawl back out, I always do, but every time it just takes a little longer. I feel so powerless.

Edit: I've had a few hours to meditate and distract myself, feeling a little more level now. I just want to say thank you to this community and everyone here. It helps so much with the loneliness. Be gentle with yourself, please. You're a lovely person, you deserve kindness. Thank you."
1,"Anyone else feels like they are annoying everyone?. I get ill or upset over something? Mum yells at me.

I’m too tired because of work, sudden change in environment and social circle (went from having friends to not knowing anyone) and depression? Sister thinks I’m being lazy for just not wanting to do something last minute on my only day off. Or for not washing a mug and a plate straight away.

I’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

I feel like no matter what I do, I’ll always be annoying to everyone around me. I’m sorry for not being super happy atm, I’m just having a bad fucking time which apparently nobody understands."
1,"If isolation is bad, why does it feel so good?. Why do I feel even more inhuman when I'm with others?

I don't want to talk, I don't want to smile. I don't want one of my friends to listen. I'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining.




Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.



You have to see what's wrong and adjust it.
And right now, every form of human interaction feels like I'm doing a marathon with that leg..."
1,"Reminder: NO ACTIVISM is allowed here at any time.. We know that September 10 was World Suicide Prevention Day. And, we're all for activism. But not here, please and thank you. It takes focus away from our OPs in need of support and understanding. "

1,"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself :). I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"
1,"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die."". This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
1,"You don't know how much depression affects you until you have a good day. Yesterday I played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards I laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier. I suddenly realized an odd, light, positive feeling in my chest. I'd forgotten how nice good days could be, and how giddy, bone-deep happiness felt. I hope this is a sign I'm getting better again!!"
1,"Do you also sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are not depressed anymore?. Every now and then I start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything. I start to have all these ideas about how I will change things around and become a better person etc. Just to find that the morning after I'm as depressed as ever, if not more. It's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say ""Psyche! You still suck."""
1,"My dog just saw me crying on the back porch and started barking at random things.. She wasn't sure what was making me upset, but she wanted to scare it off. Getting a dog hasn't cured my depression, but she sure has made it easier to deal.

I love this dog."
1,"My mother died and i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me on the same day..  

Hey guys, so.. i don't actually know how to tell this, i won't bore you with the whole story. basically, some months ago, i wake up because of my girlfriends phone, it was her gym coach who, i found out, she was having sex with. i stare at the phone in disbelief, i couldn't believe it. and now that? i woke my girlfriend up, yell at her, and ask her to leave.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I wish i could hug my mother in this situation."
1,"I have constant passive suicidal thoughts. Recently I think I’ve been okay. Not super happy, but not completely down in the dumps, but ever since about a week ago, I’ve been getting passive suicidal thoughts. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it. This has happened every day. Even this morning, my first thought when getting out of bed was “I should just die” These thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what I have to do during the day, which makes me feel useless, which makes me think about suicide. It’s an endless fucking cycle and I hate it."
1,"Does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention?. I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?"
1,"Anyone else jealous of others happiness?. It could be over the smallest thing. Whenever I hear someone talk about hobbies or anything I am just envious of them. I wish I could enjoy things, I wish I could actually have the desire to do anything. It hurts. 

I absolutely hate when people ask me “So what are your hobbies?” “What did you do this weekend?” Shit like that. I have no answer because I just stay in my damn bed whenever I’m not at work. The other day someone asked me “Have you done anything interesting lately?” I just straight up said “No, I’m boring” 

I hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. And I get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I don’t blame them. But goddamn I wish I wasn’t like this. Its not a choice, I wouldnt wish this on anyone. It’s literally the worst. A curse. Why couldn’t I just be normal and have a happy life"
1,Does anyone else just wanna start new. I just want to move to a town where no one knows me and start fresh. I’m struggling so much
1,I just wish I could be asleep for the rest of my life. Probably sounds stupid but the only thing I look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for 15 hours. I like dreaming. I wish I could sleep longer
1,"People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.. UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

Edit 3: If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists."

1,I took my first shower alone.. Normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since I'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe . I just don't feel like I'm worthy of bathing. But today I was home alone and I decided to shower today by myself . It felt scary but great. I usually am terrified I'll fall or drown or some weird crap. But today I did it alone..
1,"I Hate when you feel slightly okay for a brief moment and your mind tells you that you must actually be a fraud and there's nothing wrong with you. I've been clinically depressed for nearly 2 years now, I never enjoy anything and never look forward to anything

But I'm going to see Foo Fighters tonight and I feel not too bad at this moment, I would nearly say I'm excited.

So naturally I start to think that I'm a fraud and there's nothing wrong with me if I am in fact capable of some sort of positive emotion. 

I fucking love depression. smh"
1,"Why don't you talk to us?. My parents keep asking me this question.
Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""
Then they left saying:""You can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.""

This is why I don't talk to you.

Edit: Just read through the comments. Thanks guys. It really means something to me."
1,"Don’t want to sleep because tomorrow will come faster. All I want to do is get in bed and sleep forever, but I can’t seem to bring myself to sleep because that will just bring tomorrow faster and that is worse than just lying here exhausted.

1,"I have been self harm-free since February and I’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy.. I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help.

Edit: Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone. Thank you Reddit."

1,"Does anybody else fantasize about just...disappearing? Like taking off to a far away place, cutting off all ties that you have, and just starting new?. I know that's not a solution to depression, but it's something I think about a lot as well as other things that depression consists of. 

I just imagine myself taking off, somewhere far away, near a nice beach, and just simplifying my life. Not telling anyone where I've gone, not speaking to friends and family ever again. Just...disappearing. 

Edit: 

Some of you brought up the point that our problems are internal and not external. I know that, but that doesn't stop me and my mind from thinking of taking off. "
1,I wish my mom hated me so I could kill myself without making anyone upset.. I'm not fit for this world and wish I could leave without causing anyone pain.
1,"I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.. I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. "
1,"I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.. ""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."
1,"Anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up.. In laying here about to sleep and every night I have the mantra in my head of that I hope I never wake up. I don't want to kill myself but I'd rather just never wake up again. That way no one will be mad at me for dying by my own hand. That way I can't disappoint anyone anymore. 

Anyone else?"
1,"The older I get, the more I realize I’m going nowhere in life and the more I hate myself.. It literally terrifies me that I have no idea what I’m doing with my life and I just feel like I’m losing it. I have no marketable skills or I’m too mentally ill to understand what worth I possess and every day it’s just this terrible feeling of life passing me by. 

I feel like I’m painfully aware of being swallowed by this deep, bottomless pit and I still can’t do anything about it. 

I wish I was better than this.

Edit: I wrote this yesterday when I was having a really bad moment. I’ve basically read all the replies and you’re all very kind. Thank you all for your advice and especially for your compassion. For those of you who mentioned you feel like you wrote this, or you empathize, I’m sorry that anyone has to feel like this. It sucks."
1,"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.. before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

I feel so tired of keeping up the mask. I can't carry on their expectation. Even if i want to, I can't handle it."
1,"Why do people tell me being alive is special? THIS is life. Mundane days like these from morning to evening until we die. There's no fucking transcendent spiritual bullshit crap. IT'S JUST FUCKING THIS!. I woke up a few hours ago and ate too many chips and too much chocolate pudding until I felt sick.

Then I read the news and felt sick.

Then I read r/popular and felt sick.

Then I looked at the mirror and felt sick.

What's up with this crap? What do people see there? It's the same old shit every day. I'm not even hopeless I'm just annoyed because everyone is so delusional.

Life is more of this. Locations, schools, work places, are just wallpapers that are changing. Personality, clothes, haircuts, are just avatars that are changing. Success is just reaching higher levels in the same shitty game. The emptiness, the pain, the anxiety, stays the same.

Life is stabbing you, hurting you, mocking you, and offering you ice cream. Then people ask if you're depressed because you don't like ice cream. No, I don't like ice cream fucking hell, why don't you stick it up your...

Sorry, I just needed to vent a little.



EDIT: I just want to remind everyone that this is a venting post. Maybe it's not wrong, but it's also not a normal or healthy way of thinking. A depressed world view can be *valid* while depression is *still an illness*. It's an illness that can, in many cases, be treated. It's always worth to try to make life less miserable."
1,"I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?. I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows"
1,"Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?. I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! Now I feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. I wish I could hug each one of you individually <3"
1,"I no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.. I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment."
1,"I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.. I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   
Merry fucking Christmas to me."
1,"I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.. People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

1,"I don’t want to kill myself but sometimes I want to stop existing.. I wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? Like a less permanent way to disappear. Just get off the grid for a while but then come back once I’m feeling better. Is it just me?"
1,"If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14. All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it."

I honestly have given up entirely on typical, conventional life goals such as finding love, home ownership, and a fulfilling career. I just want to throw in the towel already."
1,"Sometimes while enjoying time with my friends, all of a sudden I get very down and feel like crap. Over basically nothing. How do I get over this?. It has happened more than once, usually I just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it’s hard.

1,"""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."" -- F. Scott Fitzgerald. This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
1,i wish i could restart my life. become someone else and actually do something good with this life.. but its impossible. my only chance to be something is gone.
1,Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people. I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. 
1,"Every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it. It happens every time. They say to reach out if you're struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down. People either make it a competition about who has it worse, or try and tell you that you don't have ""real"" depression. Another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse. For some reason it always happens with this illness. Can this stop already?"
1,"My parents just yelled at me for 2 hours.. My mother decided to take me to the hospital tomorrow, so at dinner, I asked my parents which hospital we will go, father astonished, he didn't know we have such a plan. I fucked up.

He started yelling: ""she's not crazy!!!"" ""she's not sick at all!!!"" ""she's normal!!!"" blah blah. Mother yelled back, and all of a sudden, they turned at me. I don't need to mention the rest.

I can't stop crying, I'm so fucking desperate, my mother uses my father's high blood pressure to threaten me, said if I can't be a nice daughter he will die from stroke because of me. I know, I know I've done nothing wrong, but I can't stop thinking about that possibility, I feel guilty, it's all because of my existence, I won't commit suicide tonight but I don't know about future, fuck, fuck."
1,"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts.. I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I’m a perfectionist, and I couldn’t get it right."
1,"does anyone else wish they could die from an outside cause. like it’s fucked up, but i wish i would get cancer or have someone hit my car and push it off the edge of the canyon or something.

i just want to die but i don’t really want it to be my fault necessarily."
1,"I need constant background noise (youtube, watching series) because I'm afraid of being alone with my own thoughts. Going to sleep is scary because I don't know how I'll feel in the morning.. Just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. It feels like I'm not entirely alone then. My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired. In order for things to change I need to do something, but to do something I need energy... so yeah...

I want to sleep the entire time and I'm much more exhausted in general, but I'm also afraid. Will I feel better when I wake up or worse?"
1,"I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.. I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

1,"The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”. When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever."

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv.

1,"I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and... I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."

All I have to do is wait until I'm 16, I'm gonna have friends, have a girlfriend, go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

It doesn't get better."
1,"My Wife and 2 infant daughters were killed this morning in a car crash.. I can't go on. Im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. Im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit I cant deal with it. Im going to kill myself within the hour. 

Suppose I feel like I had to write this down somewhhere.


edit: Please see update comment.

1,"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.. So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest."
1,"Does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you’re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn’t actually have depression at all?. Even despite an official diagnosis, I constantly think, anytime I want to share my thoughts, that I’m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones. It makes me feel guilty the moment I open my mouth to talk about how I’m feeling. Anyone else?

It makes it worse that every time I talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that I don’t want to be with her. And I get livid that she’s made it about her. Maybe I am just selfish and attention-seeking. "
1,do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive. and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol
1,"Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?. I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."
1,"Anyone else wish they could hit the reset button?. I know the past is the past and i only have moment but i wish i could just hit a reset button and go back 5 years. Oh how different my life could of been. 

The mistakes i made. It sucks. I've been through waves of depression but but deep down i've always thought maybe things will turn out but this is the first time i feel like that little dying ember inside me is completely burnt out."

1,"Does anybody else notice that they are becoming increasingly bitter as time goes by, but they can't help it?. I also feel like I'm getting judged for it and excluded from family events."
1,I just wanna fucking die already. I didn’t ask to be here.. I used to distract myself by watching tv shows to escape from reality but my attention span has gotten so fucking bad I can’t even do that anymore. Why can’t I just die in my sleep and put an end to this miserable existence. I doubt anybody is gonna read this but it’s 3 am and I just needed to rant.
1,"""yOU GoT nO ReAsoN tO Be DePResSED"". No. Please don't ever say that. If you said that once and you mean it, I hate you. You don't live my life and people that say that don't know anything about depression. It's one of the worst things you can ever say to someone depressed."
1,"""your problem is that you don't socialize"". Word? That's the magic elixir? Damn. I wonder why I never thought of that, mom!"
1,"Taking care of the most basic things when your depressed is difficult. Like washing, eating, staying on schedule, and so on.. It just doesn't matter. I think I could go on not washing for a month if my guilty conscience didn't tell me to at least act like a human being."
1,"I just went from a straight A student all my life to a straight F student and I still don’t know if I’m faking my depression. Just felt like venting. No one knows how I scored, including my friends and parents. Everyone thinks I’m effortlessly and naturally smart. I wish they could see how much I’m struggling."
1,"Anyone else afraid of appearing ""happy"" in front of family/friends in fear that they won't take your depression seriously?. I've made a horrible habit of holding back the occasional smile or laugh because I don't want anyone for even a split second to mistake that for me being happy. As a result I continue to suffer more yet I still don't change. Then I feel poorly about myself for ""manipulating"" those around me. Anyone relate?"
1,"I drew a comic about my experience with depression.. Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
1,"Does anyone else wake up feeling fine for about 5 minutes before anxiety and depression take over?. Most mornings I wake up feeling absolutely mentally content, then within about 5 minutes all the shit just hits me.

A mixture of anxiety and depression.

I feel that cozy feeling mentally when I wake up but it dissapears. I used to feel like that inside all day long."
1,"I enjoy being alone, but hate feeling lonely.. I hate that I am this way. I push people away, but then complain about being lonely.

1,"A friend told my teacher that I want to kill myself. Now I'm in an even bigger mess. So that happened... I had a really bad day and told my friend that I basically have no reason to live and that I want to kill myself. She told another friend, and she said it to my teacher. 

The teacher immediately called my parents. Now they're mad at me for everything. My friends are mad at me. My teacher is mad at me. Everything has gone to shit...

I just cannot say what I'm thinking, because it always hurts someone. I won't be able to hold it in for long. Guess this might be my last week on this world. I hope that without me everyone will finally be able to get some rest"
1,"I. Really. Hate. How. It. Come. And. Goes. In. Waves.. At one time, I feel all right.

A moment later, I feel like I'm the worst (fill in the brackets) again."
1,"I had a friend over for the first time in two years today. She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9:30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours!  I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. 

For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? 

I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas 😀) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do..

EDIT: wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3


POINTLESS EDIT #2: woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)"
1,"Open letter to my son. To my beautiful boy. My sweet, sweet little man. 

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong. 

A mothers love is like no other. It’s true. Without you I probably wouldn’t even be here. You’ve taught me that no matter what I have been put in this world for a reason. To be your best friend. You deserve the entire world. 

Mama loves you, my darling."
1,does anyone else actually WANT to do something productive but you have no energy because you are so tired and lazy and unmotivated that you can't bring yourself to do it?. and then you just stay in bed and browse Reddit and pointless crap the whole day and then feel guilty for procrastinating. But then you promise yourself to do it tomorrow or some other day and it happens again and the cycle just keeps repeating and you just keep feeling guilty again and again
1,"I tried to hang myself yesterday and they're talking about getting me into school in two days. F 13. I am depression. The person I used to be is gone, there is no going back from this.
I'm just sat In the hospital while my mum speaks to cahms, trying to hide my neck from all the other patients. I'm desperate to leave the hospital and get home but I know I'm gonna try again eventually.

I've been on fluoxetine (prozac) for three months and everything is still getting worse. 

I just wish so much that the knot held, life just isnt for some people."
1,"Anyone else feel like they just aren’t cut out for life?. Ever since leaving school and entering “the real world”, I have realised I’m just not cut out for it and honestly I wish I was never born.

I’m in my mid 20s now and the thought of possibly living another 50+ years until I die of old age, terrifies me. 50+ years of anxiety, dread and self-hatred...what kind of life is that?"
1,"I had a shower and brushed my teeth for the first time in 2 weeks today.. There was more blood than toothpaste in my mouth by the end but hopefully I can keep doing it. The pain felt good.

edit: whoah that blew up..."
1,Doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.. I feel like nothing makes me happy; even when I'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit I still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. Sometimes I actually feel worse.
1,"I just want a hug so badly it hurts. I've never hugged anyone before...

I just want to know what the warmth of another person feels like...I'm so tired of being alone.

I'm so pathetic, I'm laying here trying to sleep and i just can't stop crying like a dumbass, hugging a blanket."
1,"I'm only living to see if I'll be happy one day, but I'm impatient.. I'm sad most of the time, and when I'm not, I'm empty. I've put into motion plans that I think will make me happy again, but they'll take years, and I'm tired of waiting. How do I withstand my life until it's all better?"
1,My mom was killed two weeks ago.. I don't know what to do. My dad died when I was 11 and mom died two weeks ago from an incident with a neighbor. We buried her yesterday. Its easter weekend. My girlfriend wants to go to a party but I just want to chill. I don't know if its a good idea to go or not. Shes understanding and will stay home with me. I just think its too soon to be around a party group. Also I'm 28 so I don't have a lot of life experience.
1,"Alone and Abandoned on my birthday. It's my 17th birthday today and first of all none of my friends except 3 wished me. At home my stupid dad was to drunk to acknowledge me and I am sitting here on my birthday in tears, feeling alone.

\*Edit: Thanks a lot for all the nice comments, it is crazy how people on the interent can be so kind and it has meant a lot

\*Another Edit: It is the day after my birthday and I woke up to like +300 messeges. Holy crap thanks a lot I don't think you understand how much it has cheered me up! I will make sure to reply to everyone, but I don't want to rush it, but from the bottom of my heart....Thank you."
1,"I wish I could re-do my teenage years without my anxiety and depression. And in a different time period, prior to the internet being a thing. 70s or 80s maybe. I spent my entire childhood locked away in my room with a glowing blue screen."
1,"i feel like depression has made me less smart. i dont think about much anymore. the things i do think about are unimportant.

because of this, i dont have anything intelligent to say. im not funny or clever or smart. i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this.

i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so one-dimensional and dull."
1,It’s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves. I guess I’ve just been living like this so long it’s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all
1,"I did it guys! Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I cleaned my house!. I'm clinically depressed, and have been on Wellbutrin for about 4 months now. It certainly evened me out a bit as I'm not as mopey, but when I get home I don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. 

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

I actually feel like I can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that I never want to do anything at my house.

E: wow, I did not anticipate the overwhelming support. thanks gals/guys for letting me know that I'm not alone. Also, obligatory thanks for the gold kind Sir/Ma'am

E2: ayy, y'all threw me in the 100k karma territory, thanks pals. *proceeds to get down voted to hell*"
1,"I feel beyond suicidal. Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Edit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone. I wish I could thank each one of you individually! Thanks for being there Reddit. <3"
1,"Just deleted a suicide note I wrote two years ago. I don't recognise the person in it, it's not me anymore :). I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."
1,"am I the worst human being in the world for secretly hoping the coronavirus would take my mum so that I can kill myself without affecting anyone too dear to me?. it's such a selfish selfish thought and Im trash for even thinking it.
obviously I do not want my mum to suffer through it OR for her life to be taken, but right now she's the only reason I'm still alive and I feel so trapped, im just wishing for any way out now

1,"memory loss from depression. so recently my depression has hit a low point as I am in the middle of switching my meds since i saw a psychiatrist this week and she diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety and is worried about me. anywho, my memory has been BAD. like, I cant remember what I am doing sometimes or past 20 minutes of anything someone tells me. can anyone else relate? right now, i dont know if its derealization but I just dont feel present. I feel like i am alive but not here, i cant remember anything and it is driving me crazy. I would rather be sad, unmotivated, and depressed rather than suffering from memory loss."
1,"Anyone else thinks depression completely changed them as a person?. I'll just keep it short and say: nowadays, I do bold things without regard to whatever the outcome of it may be.

 All I say is ""fuck it"" and wait for it to screw me up."
1,"Some people have sexual fantasies, I just fantasise about getting hugged and being shown basic affection and it never happens. That's all. That's whats getting me down. I have a few friends irl, but i feel lonely, i feel unloved."
1,"Do you ever just lie in bed, thinking how different your life COULD be and imagining all the possibilities instead of actually going out there and doing them?. I do. I know it's a lot easier than getting stuff done and I wouldn't be able to get half the stuff I want done done anyways."
1,Does anyone else just think “kill yourself” every time you do something wrong?. I make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so I end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. It’s like a reflex at this point. I’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. I’m afraid I’ll start saying it out loud or something
1,Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?. Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.
1,"I have no passion for anything anymore. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I dread waking up and I can’t wait to go home to sleep just so I don’t have to think anymore. I use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all I do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week. My life is so meaningless I feel as if it isint going anywhere and I just feel so empty inside. I use to enjoy activities I use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever I do I can’t enjoy . I don’t know how to get out of this sometimes I can sit for hours just staring at a wall I am so dead inside"
1,"I really miss feeling joy and euphoria. I wish I still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like I did as a kid. Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. 

Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.

Edit: please stop suggesting drugs"
1,"Sharing something I’m proud of for a chance. The past two weeks I have cooked almost daily instead of eating fast food, I’ve kept my house clean, showered regularly, and I’ve done all of my work for Grad school (even some of it way ahead of time). I usually don’t say I’m proud of myself but I think I need to say it today."
1,"Anyone just want to take a break from life and just go to a park on a summer night and just look at the stars alone?. That's all I want. I wanna go to a park, lay on the grass by the lake and look at the stars, alone. Life is so beautiful, just wish I wasn't apart or this society "
1,"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?. First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

Afterthought:  can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression'  

 Haha, fuckin' A."
1,"Nobody wants to deal with negative people. You really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers, friends, and family. If you’re not always a ray of sunshine, you become the negative, depressed person who is no fun to be around. At the end of the day, no one really gives a shit about what you’re dealing with. If you’re not being positive and smiling, no matter the reason, they have a problem with you.

I wish there wasn’t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing. It is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor."
1,Does anyone else feel their life won't go anywhere?. It's the same thing over and over. I'm always physically sick and emotionally drained and I've gone through a lot since childhood. I'm just tired and hope for future seems bleak.
1,"Depression has made me so stupid. I can’t concentrate, I don’t focus, I miss the picture of concepts. Overall I’m just disengaged and demoralized. I live the same repetitive day over and over. Dropped out of school for the 4th time, can’t keep jobs, lose passion. I’m comically miserable. I don’t even feel like a real human anymore. I used to be articulate blah blah but nope. At this point I just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that’s next to me until I have to move. No wonder my brain is rotting. Hell I can’t even get through reading paragraphs on Reddit. I generally don’t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards. Same fights"
1,"Two days ago I was feeling amazing, the best I ever have and now I am miserable and want to die. Wtf brain.. The last few days I felt on top of the world, had boundless energy, felt my depression was completely cured. Was so happy, life was so beautiful, every thing was so beautiful. I was planning days out, chatting to people more than I ever do, making jokes, laughing. Felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe. 
Now I'm lying in bed tired and miserable because I painted my shed door and made a mess of it so I'm obviously a worthless human being. The idea of following through with any of those plans I made fills me with dread. 

I wish the happiness would actually last."
1,Does anyone else feel like they either can't or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldn't complain?. I often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how I feel when I'm upset.
1,Dear God. Please make me not wake up tomorrow.. All life is is not killing yourself in the hope one day life becomes bearable. It never does. Please take me away somewhere else. Not dead so my parents do not suffer. Just make me not exist. Please.
1,"I really don't want to die. I actually really like life. I just don't like my life.. I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. I think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom I consider to be the majority). To me, life is wonderful. Except I don't like *my* life. I wish I could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what I'm looking for in life. I'm 21 and all I can think about is everything I have missed out on and will miss out on in life. I wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. I don't want to stop playing, I just wish I could start a new game."
1,"Warning: Watch out for PMs pushing religion.. **Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**"
1,"Makes friends -> get close, really get to know them -> alienate them slowly with your issues -> get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime -> repeat. This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

Edit: thanks for the silver guys, I wasn't expecting this to be so well received."
1,"depression feels like dying before your body has died. after depression there is no more need to live, its as if mental and physical death went out of sync"
1,"My 12 year old sister attempted suicide.. She was being badly bullied by people at her school for the past 6 months, and yesterday she did the unthinkable and took 40 paracetamols. Luckily she survived, but it's affecting everybody in the family awfully. I live in a different country to my family, and I feel so helpless that I can't be there and give them all a hug and tell them it'll be okay. Going to try and get the first flight I can to be with them.
She sent me a picture of her laying in the hospital bed, and she has teddy bear plasters on her skin. She's just a child. It destroys me that somebody so young, can feel so done with life. I suffer with depression too, and have attempted suicide in the past so I know what she's going through. I'm sorry. I just needed to offload of all this, as it feels like my head's going to explode with all the emotions going through my brain right now."
1,What if I don’t have depression and I’m just a lazy worthless useless human being who does absolutely nothing. I’m just using resources undeservingly that should be reserved for more worthy people tbh.
1,"I hate when people say ""life will get better"". I want life to BE better not to GET better, I want it ""better"" NOW, I don't want to wait for fate. I'm done waiting.

 besides the future is uncertain, it could very well get better or it could get even worse, and most of the times it may be out of your reach."
1,When I'm alone I want people but when I'm with people I want to be alone.. I never know what I need to be happy. How do I figure out what my actual social needs are?
1,"I never planned to make it to 15. Today I turned 17.. A little over two years ago, I’d been planning to kill myself before my 15th birthday. Today is my 17th and I’m actually happy I’m alive. I still have some very low days, but I feel so much better than I did back then. Things get better, even if it happens slowly."
1,"Is anybody else here experiencing anhedonia?. It's the state of not getting pleasure from otherwise pleasurable activities.

Or, as I read once in a website thread about anhedonia, ""*essentially, I gain nothing from my daily life; my world is cold and, as such, it makes life seem the same way. Everything I look at, everything I do, looks and feels the same.*"".

Is this something you guys identify with? Because I sure do. What's it like for you?"
1,"I honestly want to die just to see how people would react. My inconsiderate parents, how will they react?

My fake friends, how will they react?

My unhelpful teachers, how will they react?

My sibling who is always a pain, how will he react?

Ik this may sound messed up but I’m genuinely curious because right now when I’m on earth no one appreciates me at all."
1,"My therapist committed suicide. Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?”  I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. Thanks for listening. "
1,"""How can you be depressed? You always seem to be happy."". Yesterday a friend told me that. To be honest, when I am around other people I pretend to be happy as if nothing is wrong since I don't want to bother others with my issues. I don't really know why I am doing this."
1,"My girlfriend died. Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

1,Anyone else feel like they just simply weren't cut out for this world?. Maybe it's just a sad excuse for where I am in life but it just feels like my attributes weren't geared to succeed in this world. It's as if I fall hopelessly short in nearly every metric that makes someone a successful and happy person.
1,"Anyone else have semi-suicidal thoughts on a regular basis?. I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. "
1,"I hate being alone, yet I want to be alone.. Id push someone away even if I wanted them to stay, because I feel everyone is better off without me."
1,"We only see those who get better. Aka survivorship bias. We hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there’s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. I’m tired of hearing “It will get better, just look at what happened to me!” Because it hasn’t. Why should I continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? I call it as I see it. If my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then I probably won’t end up as a survivor."
1,"All I want is not to wake up tomorrow. I don't enjoy anything anymore. The hobbies I used to do just no longer interest me. The older I get, the less I enjoy talking to people. I havent talked to the people I used to call friends in several months. All I want is to go to sleep tonight and not wake up in the morming. So I can just be done pretending to be a happy, normal person. I don't want to kill myself because my parents and people would be sad, but I hate that the only thing I keep going for is so other people don't have to bury me. I wish I could get sick and die, or get hit by a car, or anything that would let me just be done."
1,"I’m sitting in the bathroom at work trying not to cry. Depression is a fucking bitch.

EDIT: holy shit you guys are the most supportive bunch. I’ve been reading through every comment feeling more supported by each one. It breaks my heart that you’ve all experienced that same heavy pain that depression brings, but knowing I have people out there who truly get it makes me feel a little less alone. I fucking love you all, thanks for taking time to reach out."
1,"Millions of years of evolution among millions of species on this planet, all with a single common instinct within them :- Survive. And here my brain is telling me everyday to kill myself.. If that doesn't prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us, then I don't know what will. I really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down, that too by people whom you would give your life for. Fuck this shit, I hope I was born heartless and emotionless so I didn't care about these kind of people but I still love them even after they refused to help me. I hope I die a miserable death. It would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me. 

If I cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself, I promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this. "
1,"Is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate?. I try to keep my mental health issues to myself. I don't want to tell others because I feel like an attention whore, and I've been accused of that before. What about you?"
1,"I miss the old me. I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food I gave him today because he’s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I’m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different.

EDIT: I never expected this post to blow up so much and I’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. Thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special"
1,"What does a person even do all day?. I don't get it. I have so many things I could do right now - exercise, listen to music, watch a movie, anything - but I have no motivation. It's not that I want be lazy, no, it's that I have no inclination to do anything in particular and that I know I'll most likely feel disappointed if I DO force myself to do anything because it won't be fulfilling and all I'll be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things. I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something. I'm just cycling between the same sites I check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different.

What does a person even do all day? I don't get it."
1,Anyone else feel like they're just scraping through each day to make it home and return to your vicious cycle habits?. Every day I go to work barely doing anything and get home excited for the thought of being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room.  Does anyone else feel too drained from daily routines to ever break the cycle?
1,"Who else envies people without depression?. I wish I wasn't born with this de habilitating disease. I find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive. Anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it? For instance, I got promoted at work but it's so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position. Other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me. And when I try to do it it's just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so I go off and do leisurely things. Anyone have any tips to combat this?"
1,"The question I hate most: ""Are you okay?"". Because the answer is always ""no"" but if I say ""no,"" they always ask me whats wrong. If you can see through my happy facade I'm nowhere near capable of telling you what's wrong without breaking down. If I am somehow capable of telling you, you won't understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes. You will always see my answer to your question written on my face..."
1,"High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand. People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."
1,"I had to fill out one of those depression tests today.... And I scored in the 'severe' range. This lead to the following exchange between my Doctors and I.

Doctor: This is a really high score.

Me: Thank you.

Thankfully, I saw the funny side it in it's awkwardness...and I hope you guys do too! Sometimes, the only way to cope with how terrible things are is to laugh...Stay strong, fam."
1,"DAE say ""I'm sick"" instead of ""I'm depressed"" because you know you won't get taken seriously otherwise?. It's ironic that depression is an illness in the first place, yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone.

If anyone knows where I can get this ""Snap out of it"" medication I've heard is so effective, I would be so grateful if you let me know where I can buy it from."
1,"Suicide is sounding better than ever right now.. 20F here... I’ve been battling depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. Sometimes I’m okay for several months, but it always has a way of sneaking back up on me. I was working hard, nearly finished with school when Coronavirus hit. I lost my job, no way to pay my tuition (it’s a monthly bill through a trade school not an official university) I won’t be able to graduate until I pay my tuition off in full and I’m still about $400 away with absolutely no income coming in. I smoke weed to help with the depression and anxiety and I’m almost out of it. I have $1 in my bank account. I’m scared, I don’t want to go back to a shitty job just to pay the rest of my tuition. I’ve been cooped up at home unable to see my friends, having to tiptoe around my stepdad who had something to say about everything I do including scolding me every time I leave the house during this crisis. I don’t know if I want to keep living. Sometimes I wish I’d catch the Coronavirus and go out without having to pull the trigger myself because I’m a coward.

Edit: wow I cannot believe how much this post blew up! Just to let you all know I am okay it was a nervous breakdown that triggered me but I’m going to get through this, I’ll be alright. Thank you all so much!! xx and stay safe in these times <3

Edit #2 for those of you commenting you are also feeling suicidal. Please reach out to someone either someone you trust, me, or a hotline where someone can hear you and help you. This post was made when I was very upset and panicking and I do not believe suicide is or ever will be a good way out. Stay strong my loves"
1,"I never realized it, but I always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because I never wanted them to go through what I'm going through right now.. Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?

I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.

And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust."
1,"My friend killed himself. He was 18. I grew up with him and he was like my little brother. He was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes. He was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh. He killed himself.  He didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day. He was exhausted and he only saw one option and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself. I am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and I can't breathe. I feel too much while feeling too little.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. But this. This is...overwhelming. It is excruciating. It is numbing. It is agonizing and yet it is impassive.  I feel everything and I feel nothing.   I don't want to die. But I don't know how to live.

I'm fighting every day. I'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast. Every day is a struggle right now. But I'm fighting. Keep fighting, friends."
1,"I'm not ignoring you, I just forgot about my own existence.. This is truly how I feel when people ask me why I'm not texting/calling them back."
1,"Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better. It's really weird. My friends in school have no idea about my depression and I like to keep it that way, so I always try my best to hide it and I smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when I have a second to myself but it's just really weird. Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.

Edit: It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days"

I'm literally sitting here waiting for a text back from this guy as I refresh my ""Following"" activity on Instagram to see if he's liking anything so I can get mad/sad that I'm getting ignored. What is wrong with me ahahhahahahahhahaha"
1,"Do you procrastinate even before doing things you enjoy?. Because I can't watch a movie or tv show without procrastinating first, it's so annoying to waste so much time, yet I still do it. "
1,"Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?. I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

Think I'm going back on the Zoloft."
1,"Does anyone else’s depression get worse when it starts to get late?. I can be alright for the majority of the day, but as soon as the sun starts to set, I immediately start feeling overwhelmed by my depression. I’ve also been getting suicidal thoughts A LOT here lately, without any external cause."
1,"I just want to be passionate about something again. It's been so fucking long. I try to find a hobby, a goal, a fucking anything, but I just can't. Best case scenario I put a lot of effort into it for a week or two before I finally give up faking it. I mean I literally force myself to do things hoping I'll grow passionate about them, or at least enjoy them enough to look forward to doing them.


But I can't, and I don't know how to make it better. 40 years old, my youngest kids are starting to get to the point where they don't need me as much anymore which is good for them. I fear the day tho when I don't even have them to give me some purpose. Living out the rest of my days as a functional vegetable. Pretty sure that's where I'm headed.

/rant"
1,"Does anyone ever wonder how normal/healthy people work?. I sometimes wonder how it would feel to function as a person, like how amazing it would feel to get a goodnights sleep and wake up in the morning feeling exited for the day. I mean is that even possible?"
1,"I spent my whole life walking on eggshells, trying not to offend, to please everyone. Now I feel like the most uninteresting person alive.. The worst part is that now I have this ingrained in my behaviour. If someone says something that I disagree with, I try to twist my views to agree with theirs. 

I'm so worried about seeming normal, that I take everything someone says seriously, which makes me look like an idiot when I inevitably take seriously every joke that gets thrown at me.

When I examine my past behaviour, all the jokes seem obvious and all the twisted opinions seem stupid, but I can't help it. The only thing that brings out my true self is alcohol, but I don't want to go down that road.

I just wish I could be as confident sober as I am when drunk (slightly drunk, I've never been so drunk I couldn't control my behaviour, or puked and couldn't stand up straight). Everything feels so natural, so relaxed, I feel like a man instead of a mouse."
1,"You know you are fucked up when you cant enjoy video games anymore. I am so fucked up that I can't enjoy any game anymore. I just wanna die now
"
1,"I hate going to sleep because it means I have to wake up in the morning. Sometimes, I will literally procrastinate going to sleep so that I have more time before the next day. Because to me, the day doesn't end until I fall asleep. I don't even remember most of my dreams, if I have any in the first place"
1,Does anyone ever feel physically too weak. Everyday I experience a rush of weakness or something. It’s hard to explain.. I’m beginning to wonder if I have a medical condition or if it’s just my depression. At some point in the day I’ll randomly just feel incredibly fatigued but it’ll usually pass in a few minutes. Almost as if my brain and body are shutting off.
1,"Attempted Suicide today. By stabbing myself so i can bleed to death. This is my 2nd time calling the hotline, i've attempted suicide an hour ago. This is supposed to be my final day, i was on my bathroom with a knife planning on stabbing myself so i can bleed to death.

I was in the bathroom for an hour, thinking about should i do it not?

I was supposed to do it but i thought ""What's the point of wanting end my pain if once i die i'll go to Hell and i'm gonna suffer there aswell."" So i didn't do it and went to my bed and cried.

I called the suicide Hotline, the call only lasted for 13 minutes because im scared of what will happen in the Hotline.

The Hotline did a help a little bit but everyday i feel worthless, ugly, nothing, and dumb, i have a Suicide Diary so if the day comes that i succeeded suicide people can read what I've been through.

Sorry for posting here i just wanna let it out.

EDIT: I appreciate all of the direct messages i've got. I didn't expect this to blow up. I'm sorry for bother y'all.

I believe in the Concept of ""Heaven&Hell"" i'm sorry if some of y'all got mad over this.

Yes, i'm a pussy... why would a person like go to reddit than get professional help, too broke to afford a visit. I'm only 16 so i can't really get that much money for a visit, my family never really believes  in depression.

I'm sorry for bothering all of you. I really do."
1,"I showered, brushed my teeth and shaved for the first time since June of 2016. I'd slowly let myself slip away, and reviled in filth for the better part of the year. I don't know why I chose to do this now, but I've never felt better. "
1,"I genuinely don't have anyone anymore. I don't have any friends who want to spend time with me. I have on Friend but she doesn't care and I know that she doesn't. Im not in a relationship and never have been and probably never will be. My entire life has been watching other people make friends, get into relationships and be happy. I know I will be alone until I die. I haven't hung out with someone in months, maybe even a year. I try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me. I feel like the least important person in this entire world. I can't even maintain a friendship, so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic. I'm so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night"
1,"I hate that I.... ...sleep in so late.

...stay up so late. 

...never leave the house.

...never exercise.

...never go hiking anymore. 

...never go to meetups.

...am so lazy.

...am so fat.

...have no self control.

...eat so much. 



...am alone. "
1,"My girlfriend died. Hey everybody,

On monday my girlfriend of 2.25 years died in a motorcycle accident. She was only 18 years old.

I don't really know how to deal with the loss. I cannot speak to most of my friends. I cried a lot but now I just feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. I want to cry. I want to be sad.

I don't know how to handle it."
1,"I'm going anti-social slowly.. I've lost interest in finding friends.
It hurts me a lot when my OG friends from college starts ignoring me when they found a new better friend than me. Never talked to me anymore nor call me.

I wish i have a friend that i could talk personally to.

Idk what to do anymore.
Didn't expect growing up would be this fkn hurt.

I'm clinging to games and music to run away from all the problems i had.

I need someone to hug me and say ""its all gonna be okay"".

Guess some things are just too good to be true."
1,"The worst thing isn't being alone, it's being surrounded by people and them making you feel alone.. My roommates having his girl over for a romantic Saturday and I told him I could find someone to hang out with to give them some space. Two days ago I texted cousins, friends, and co workers and everyone said they were busy. or just plain didn't reply. I shouldn't take this personally, they are probably busy with stuff, but ever since I graduated its like I've done nothing with my life and feel like I'm not interesting enough to hang out with. I use to have a someone once who I did could always count on and hang out with, but they cut me out of their life completely and I just feel like like such a loser. "
1,"Going into 2020 the same way I went into 2019. fucking ready to die,and deeply alone.


edit:wow. a lot of you feel the same. I say we abolish this holiday bs,make our lives a bit more tolerable. also,thanks for the silver I guess. that's a story to tell if I live long enough to."
1,Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?. I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it. 
1,"Do y’all ever have those dreams where you wake up and you’re just so fucking empty because it wasn’t real.. I had a dream where a met a great girl and we had an amazing time. But later the dream kinda started to break down and I realized I was dreaming. I was so sad that I’d have to leave her. While I was fading out of the dream she just held me and comforted me. I’ve never felt so cared for, and wasn’t even fucking real. I feel fucking pathetic."
1,"My family searched my room while I was in the hospital. I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer. The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. "
1,"I'm smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that I have something to do with my hands. I lost interest in music which always been my passion. I spent the last 5 days browsing Youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings.. I should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me. My near future is uncertain and I feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself. I have to leave my flat in the end of the month. I will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until I find something to do with my life. In November, it will be one year since I haven't been intimate with a guy and it makes me feel like I am loosing my femininity.

I don't know who I am, don't know what I want, barely know how to get the things I need."
1,"It’s not fair.. I fucking hate it so much. People around me, just go through everything with so much energy and power and they’re still so happy and never exhausted.

I can’t remember the last time I was actually happy. I hate drinking because it makes me so fucking sad, but I love it because I can accept my sadness completely.

I don’t want to be lonely but I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can find the strength to kill myself. I hate it. I really hate it. It’s not fair, and fuck it. No one understands it, everyone asks me to open up and when I do they don’t know what to say.

I just wish everyone would leave and never have a good memory about me so I can kill myself.

EDIT:

Hey everyone, thank you so much for the support. I really didn’t expect so many of you to feel the same way. I appreciate all of you that are trying to help me out, I’ll try my best to reply to all the comments by tomorrow.

Thanks to you, I told my friend and she’s taking me to her therapist tomorrow. I’ll update again then.

I apologise for the spelling errors, I was drunk when I typed that out.

EDIT 2:

Friend seemed to have gone off the radar, didn’t get back to me with a time. So guess I’m stuck here then."
1,"Fuck all of this. I'm stuck at home. I have nothing to do. I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside. All my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). My physical condition is worse than ever before. Every part of my body hurts. As soon as I start to break down or cry, I get yelled at even more. I feel like I'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. I have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the kind words. And thank you to whoever gave this post gold. I feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles. It may seem hopeless now (it certainly does feel that way for me), but we'll get through this together. Love all of you!❤️"
1,"How do you guys find the motivation to do literally anything?. I have no hope, I see no future and can't push myself to do the most basic of acts (e.g. brushing my teeth). How do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds? How do you find the motivation to do the things you want/need to do?"
1,"Does anyone else just spend most of the day on YouTube,Reddit,twitter etc ?. I don’t have a life (haven’t in many many years,I’m only 25) I’m depressed and anixious all the time even when I’m watching YouTube vids. I just spend the day in zombie like state scrolling through Twitter or YouTube.

I’m just living through other people I’ve never meet. I’m just waiting for the latest news and drama. I think about suicide everyday. 

Can anyone relate ?"
1,"My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.. So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. 

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.


I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. 

I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. 

EDIT: She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition."
1,"I almost killed myself tonight. I know nobody will read this...

I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. 

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy. 

I just want this to end so badly. Why can't she care about me? About my life? I just need a friend in her. Fuck my life so bad."
1,"Who failed at 'everything' raise your hand. No, not the ""I recently lost my job, gf/bf, divorced, got cancer, I lost everything."" no, you're not the case.

It's not 'failure'. It's just losing something.

What I'm talking about is, never been able to hold onto constant job, maybe dated some but couldn't manage any relationship, invisible to friends, socially awkward, never was pretty, never achieved academic/career success, who never had anything much to lose in the first place,

Would you raise your hands? I wanna see how many are there besides me."
1,"sometimes i dont care if i wake up again or not. why would i, it'd just be another day of people screaming at me and feeling like shit because of everything i cant do

then its 2am again, everything reminds me that im alone in the world and it'll always be like that because who the fuck would be with someone like me? 

it'd just be another day of me thinking how my life would be if someone loved me

i'd finally be so happy...i wouldnt be alone anymore

i'd finally have someone that loves me...just imagine me having someone that does want to talk to me, that wants to spend his life with me too and...and we're happy together

but on the inside i just know it wont happen...i just...i know it

sometimes i wish i was strong enough to just kill myself, but i cant even do that

i wish it stopped hurting..."
1,"my bed is my best friend. It makes me feel safe, it makes me feel at home. It will never laugh at me, I will never feel insecure or exposed or watched while at bed. I can cry in my bed for hours on end and never will it say mean things to me or make me feel bad. I won't bother it and I won't disappoint or fail it, nor does it. I can sleep on it which is the best part of the day and it makes me feel cozy and warm.

my bed is my best friend and I love it to death"
1,"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”. Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. "
1,"life is a chore. Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. There are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. 

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

I hate going to sleep at every night knowing I'll wake up again, doing the same thing over. I hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain. I hate life and I wish I could give up and end everything."
1,A stranger hugged me yesterday. I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
1,It pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice. It just isn't. And not because I say it isn't. It just isn't. I try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. Coping strategies just calm me down. Smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. I don't even know. 
1,"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself. First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)"
1,People are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help. But you can literally be crying in school/public and people will just stare at you and not do anything. And then when you kill yourself they say they couldn’t have done anything to stop it. And they say they’re here for anyone who wants to talk. That lasts about a week. 
1,"Anybody else sick of the ""i feel the same"" you get everytime you try to discuss your depression with someone?. Then that person tries to turn it 180° and talks about stuff that makes him sad

And when we take our lives people say ""why didnt they speak"" BECAUSE NO BODY IS EVER GOING TO LISTEN."
1,"I achieved one goal in 2016. I started brushing my teeth. For the first time in 25 years of life, I brushed my teeth everyday for an entire month straight.. I did it you guys. I'm so happy to have one small thing. I don't know how I'll reward myself since I have no money, but I'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good. 

I  hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis. I know you're trying and I admire you for it. 

I love you all. Happy New Year! "
1,"Is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene & waking up SUPER difficult?. Ever since the diagnosis, it’s hard to get out of bed, including showering, socialising, walking (I’m not going to even call it exercise), vacuuming, combing, etc. 

My Dad thinks that it’s laziness. He says getting out of bed & working out can lessen depression."
1,"Can't because I'm depressed, depressed because I can't.. Anyone else feel this? 

Can't work because of reasons raised by depression, depressed because I can't work.

Alone, no friends, no girls ever interested in me because of depression, depressed because I can't have those things.

Countless more"
1,"Anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.. I have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that I wish I could take back. My life is in shambles and I wish I could just magically start over. My laziness is the death of me and I constantly fight demons in my head. It would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. That seems very peaceful. Life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. 

I used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years I'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. Everytime I think I hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. I won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but I am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. I always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but I just ended up becoming a no life bum. I wish I would just die while sleeping sometimes. Waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. Just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system. Even if one person reads this I'll he happy that I got this out there and could share my depression and rage which I kept bottled inside of me for so long. Keep kicking y'all hopefully we can all be happy one day."
1,"I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.. It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. 

Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?
Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die."
1,You ever wish you didn't have any family so you wouldn't feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself. I think about killing myself fairly often but I don't think I could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days I wish that I was just alone and no one was around to care so I could just do it 
1,"I’m out. Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."
1,"Does anyone feel like they're just overreacting and destroying their life 'intentionally'. Even tho now I've seen a psychiatrist I still caught myself thinking ""why don't you just start being normal"". Like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isn't that hard why the hell can't I do it!!? I would hate myself forever if I'm jsut destroying my life because I'm living with a victim mindset."
1,"Anyone cry at the sight of normal families?. It started when I was quite young. I remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father. I remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up. Today I was at work and saw a mother cuddling her daughter and she said ""you're squishing me"" and the mother replied ""that's because you are so squishable and i love you"" that shit made me need to close for five minutes."
1,"Today I'm finally throwing away my suicide note. I've been a better state of mind this past year, but I think this is the day that I finally commit to it.

I'm not going back again. I made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery, and I can do it again if I end up back where I was.

I hope, if you read this and are suffering yourself, that you see this as evidence that no matter how long you've felt this way, recovery is always a possibility.

Much love x"
1,"Sometimes I wish I could get killed so people wouldn't be mad that I killed myself. Has anyone else felt this way?. Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.

I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like ""the fuck? Get back in line."" No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.

Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.

**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**

**That too, has passed. This too, shall pass.**

**If ANY of you need an ear, or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on, I'd love to be there for you. Shoot me a PM anytime.**"
1,"There's people who don't have depression. There's people who wake up every day and are excited for what's going to happen

There's people who have a healthy social life

There's people who have friends that care about them

There's people whose life isn't ran by anxiety

There's people who get texts and calls

There's people who don't eat alone

There's people who don't hate themselves

There's people who don't think about self harm

There's people who don't think about suicide

When they have health issues you can see it. No one denies that they have a broken leg or a concussion and no one looks down on them because of it.

Fuck"
1,"Anyone else's depression made worse by the way the world is?. I'm constantly so angry that I have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living, which I'm not even interested in doing.  I'm angry I'm in a major that I hate and that the fields I was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo. I'm angry I'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job I dont like, I'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. Ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years I get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when I can travel which is the only thing I'm interested in anymore. Probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on YouTube making millions for being morons while I have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off.  I get the whole ""life isnt fair"" thing but I can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse."
1,"Anyone else get up, get dressed, and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for 30 minutes trying to figure out why you’re even bothering?. Then the fact that I wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad. "
1,"Does anyone else watch an ungodly amount of YouTube videos?. It's most of what I do in my spare time. I dunno, it just gives me little views into lives I wish I could live instead of my own."
1,"Probably no one will read this, but whatever.. My heart physically hurts. When I was 14 I remember the doctors telling my father I would grow out of the depression, because apparently a lot of kids do. But here I am, 21, 22 in a couple of months, and it’s the worst it’s ever been. It just feels like this constant darkness that I can’t run away from. I’m so miserable. Sometimes there are happy moments in my life, maybe cuz something is funny or whatever, but never happiness over a long period of time. I can’t function like a normal adult. My room is disgusting, my body is disgusting, I feel disgusting, I can’t get out of bed ever. I just want the suffering to end. I can’t handle it anymore. It doesn’t help that I have zero friends. I mean literally zero. I have tinder, so I talk to people on there every once in a while, but the conversations are meaningless. I don’t understand the point in being here if it means that I’m just going to be unhappy the entire time. I mean peoples lives usually have some purpose but I have none. What’s the point? I am only still here because I am too much of a pussy to actually end it. But if I could pay someone to kill me I would. I just need it to stop."
1,"My bed is my safe place. I know this is the clearest sign of depression, but I love staying in my bed. Even when im not tired I feel tired. When I lie down and hide in the covers, I feel like I  can avoid the world and the anxieties that come with it. As a result I'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why Im in bed now.

&#x200B;

**Does anyone feel me?**"
1,"I’m tired of being tired all the time.. I’m lying in bed exhausted. Tried to do homework but I ran out of energy. I’ve been spending an hour or two in bed in the afternoon every day for well over a week now. I feel okay during the day but an hour or two after sundown I just find myself exhausted. I go to bed five or six hours early too wiped to stand, not tired enough to sleep. I get up an hour or two before bedtime to just fiddle my thumbs in the little to no time I have left.

This is weird for me. I used to be like this after a stressful work day but now it’s everyday even on otherwise good days. It makes me so furious that I can’t do anything. I have school, I want to paint and make little indie games but in the little time off I have to hone these skills, I’m stuck paralyzed. 

Fuck depression. Depression is a little bitch."
1,"Do you guys ever quit typing your comment mid-sentence because you feel like your words aren't useful?. I want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all I feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,

1,"Best part of the day is sleeping. when night comes, you just lay there in bed thinking of all your stressful problems then suddenly everything goes dark, your conciseness goes into rest, you are no longer aware of what's life or death, your brain is numb, and you seize to exist even for a moment, before start dreaming, you feel so happy like that time when you wer....

I feel my depression gets worse when I think about how I live in a nice house, work a stable job, and am in great physical shape.

1,Finally going to Therapy.. After years of trying to bottle up and hide my depression I'm finally going to therapy to try and face it head on. Wish me luck. 
1,"do you ever feel like you are manipulating people?. whenever i tell someone about what has been going on with my life may it be friends or therapists, afterwards my thought always go to a rampage saying 

""thats not true, you are just lazy. you are not depressed. you are just manipulating them so that they can pity you."" 

i know its not true and that i have been very honest with them, but a part of me just think that. i am antagonizing my own self."
1,"I'm not fit for life.. I'm not hard working ( failed out of school ), I'm stupid as fuck, I don't have an ounce of charisma ( like talking to a brick wall) , I look like garbage , I have no interests or talents. Not good at anything, good for nothing. I only see myself as someone to lift boxes or take orders. That's it. I'm not someone worth knowing."
1,"Anyone waste time doing nothing?. I spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube, reddit and some other websites, spending no more than a couple of minutes on each. I couldn't barely finish a single video on youtube and I'd just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit, then checking reddit, then some other forums, then the game I'm afk in, then repeat again. It's too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish, let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in.

Anyone else just feel like doing nothing, feel like not wanting to live, when you are depressed?

  

Edit: Thank you for the reddit gold, even though its my first time getting it, I don't feel as appreciative as I should be considering the state that my mind is in, sorry"
1,"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.. It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart.

Finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said I shouldn't live with her anymore. I got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. We have a 6 month old daughter together.

I slept outside. It's 7 am now and I don't know what to do. I use her car to get around and now I don't have that. I also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and I don't have friends or money for uber

She told me she did this to help me "

1,"How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?. I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. 

Anyone else feel this way? "
1,"Sleeping because you no longer want to be awake. I'm sure some of you have felt this way. I'm at work. I'm fulfilling my obligations. Once I go home, I'm going to take some over-the-counter sleep meds, brush my teeth, wash my face, make sure my cat has food and water and then try to sleep until I have to work tomorrow.

I don't feel like I'm harming myself, nor do I have any real desire to kill myself; I simply don't want to be around for a certain amount of time. Like going into stasis."
1,"Ever think you're over your depression but then it hits again?. Just when I think I’m getting through my depression, it resurfaces and makes itself seem justifiable again. It makes it seem like depression is the final destination and I’m never going to get past it.

1,"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.. After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. "
1,"I really hate not taking interest in anything.. I’m the type of person who will really immerse myself in certain activities, hobbies, video games, television, etc. 

When I’m having an episode, as I currently am, I really hate the feeling of not being interested in anything.  I feel like I waste entire days just trying to find something I might enjoy doing, but it’s all been fruitless. 

It drives me crazy.  I just waste my entire weekend doing nothing of substance and go back to work on Monday."
1,Anyone masturbate as means to deal with depression?. I've been dealing with depression for a number of years now. I find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling. Does anyone else feel this way?
1,"I don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression.. All the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. Yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. There's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it."
1,"Just because someone has it worse than you, doesn’t mean that your problems don’t matter. If something upsets you, bothers you, hurts you, makes you uncomfortable, then it matters. Just because so-and-so has problems that seem worse than yours, it doesn’t make your issues invalid. 

It kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life, and the person they’re talking to says *Well at least it isn’t any worse.* That makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because *obviously* my life isn’t actually *that bad*"
1,Anyone else feel like they have to try and fight to survive because of their depression?. Depression is honestly on the verge of winning everyday but I'm still determined to try and beat it because I can't hurt those close to me like that. But it is getting harder and harder everyday I swear.
1,"I graduated medical school today. For the first time, the reality of my future has become clear to me and, as it so happens, I don't want it. More than ever, I don't want to be here anymore.

EDIT: I didn't expect to go to sleep and be absolutely inundated with messages/notifications. I sincerely appreciate all of the replies. I hadn't realized my post could be interpreted in so many ways. That being said, I think /u/veetaul hit the nail on the head:

>I think OP is saying is that they thought and expected the graduation of medical school to be something that finally made them happy and/or gave them internal validation that their presence on earth had meaning or reason. When they graduated and still didn’t feel that purpose or happiness it could feel like that was supposed to be it and they worked hard for it and it still didn’t help.

I think I may have been misconstrued as hating medicine or not caring for my career. I'm glad that I can help people. But it doesn't make me feel any different.

EDIT 2: I'd also like to mention that I'm extremely disappointed in the number of people who've attempted to invalidate my feelings in one way or another. While I may be able to easily roll my eyes and shirk it off, other people may feel very hurt by that kind of thing. Many people are afraid to talk about how they feel for fear of being judged for what makes them sad. So, for your own sake and others, stop telling people they can't feel their feelings."
1,"Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself. I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts 

Edit 2: OMG so many comments and messages. I can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. I'm reading through all of them and I appreciate all the tips and offers. I will update y'all after I leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards. One thing this has made me realize is how lucky I am to have the ability right now to pack up and go wherever I want with very little consequence "
1,"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.. Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

1,"So I bought myself flowers today.. No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)"
1,"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. They either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out. Or just outright see you completely differently.. So you put on a mask of happiness and no one ever finds out and you sink even deeper."
1,"In 8 days I have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and I’ve diagnosed with cancer.. I feel so overwhelmingly sad. My whole life has crumbled so quickly. 

I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. 

My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. 

The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do.


EDIT:  Oh my goodness. I went to sleep last night, finally. Woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. You guys are unbelievable. I can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. I love every single one of you. Thank you so much."
1,"Uncontrollable phrases?. Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"".  Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough?



Edit: thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better. Especially Mr. Wicked91 thanks, man!!!!!"

I rarely have any motivation to do anything, and when I do it's something like browsing social media or going to the shower or getting some food - basically doing stuff that just helps me sustain.

I try to date but can only blag it for so long till my real self comes out that I'm nothing and not worth being in a relationship with. 
Im to much of a coward to commit suicide but hate living. The more I try to self improve the more I end up not caring about anything.
I don't trust people and people waste my time always. 
I tried to believe in God went to church quite a lot but feel like it's for delousonal people. And not one thing changed within myself. 
I'm just sitting here watching shit on Netflix wasting my time knowing I'm a waste of space and oxygen hoping I die of a heart attack.

33 years of depression since I was born. Everyone says your life will work out you'll be happy in the future. 
And time has been ticking on and passing nothing has changed.
Welcome to a life of depression.
And thanks to some incompetent waste of space of a man and women for not wrapping up before fornicating like animals."
1,"You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?. I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
1,"I finally told my parents I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.. They didn't care at all. I got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and ""what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?"".

When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"".

I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"". 

You are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid. 

EDIT: Thank you all for the warm and understanding messages, it made me cry. To those who have parents like mine, I'm so sorry. Thank you so, so much. I woke up to so many messages, and I read every single one. "
1,"Don't you just hate it when some depressed people act like you don't get to be depressed because ""life isn't hard enough for you""?. I've stopped my friends from killing themselves a total of six times, and I'm 18. That's one of the main reasons I'm depressed. But I've told a few other depressed people about this and then they went like ""yeah, how about you try to kill yourself and start cutting, then you can come talk to me about your ""depression"" and ""hard life""""."
1,"Every night I think ""what the fuck am I doing with my life"" then wake up and do the same thing again. No control, no ambition, no motivation. Just nothing. I really wish I could muster up effort to start ANYTHING. Go to the doctor, talk to somebody, start a hobby, start learning something, but instead I do nothing and feel fucking powerless. If I do do something, I quit after one or two days.

My life fucking sucks."
1,"Anyone else's memory gotten really bad since having depression?. I forget what I did yesterday unless it's worth remembering, ever since getting it my memory has seriously deteriorated.

Then again is there any wonder when our minds are going 100mph everyday and full of worry. There's hasn't been a time in 6 years where I haven't had a tonne of thoughts racing.

I'm always worrying about my future, or lack of it."
1,"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable"". Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;

Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**

Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;"
1,"Does anyone else feel like their life has been irreversibly destroyed by mental illness?. I sure as fuck do.

I don't know what to do at this point. Suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment, but I just don't know how I would go through with it.

I mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? It's exhausting and I feel mentally crippled.

This has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement.

What the fuck is the point?"
1,"What depression actually looks like.. Playing a WoW vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed.

Staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon.

Scrolling through your Facebook timeline and wondering who these people are.

Earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food.

Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.

Wondering why you still have these problems at 30.

Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.

Never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you."
1,"Does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller, happier, more complex life full of promise?. Everyone around me seems to be doing better; like they’re happier, like they know something I don’t, or they’ve figured it out. I know everyone has their own problems, but everyone else overcomes theirs. I feel stuck; even when I make progress I feel slow, like I’m behind everyone. "
1,Anyone else casually want to die all the time?. I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. 
1,I am really sorry for people who post here and nobody replies.. I think it feels like nobody in the world cares.
1,"i’m 17 and my mom just died.. I’m gonna keep it short. Around 10:30 am i heard my brother scream is she dead?! I jolted up and walked out, there i see my mom dead on the floor with my dad trying CPR. We’re pretty sure she overdosed. No one saw this coming. I’m devastated. She was my best friend. Millions of memories with her helping and loving me. My family is struggling. I need help. I can’t live with this feeling. She was my best friend. I love her so much. Anything that can help me?

Thanks for all your honest answers, it just doesn’t feel real, i just feel like she’s gonna walk into my bedroom with food and give me a nice hug :("
1,"I think the worst part of being depressed for so long is that not only do you start to believe it’s “who you are”, the people around you do as well.. I am 21 and have had mental health issues since 14. I can say at 14 it started while 16 it hit scary/severe status.

So with that age I’m around my family and friends because I can’t really get away from them. 


Over time it has become normal to them that I never want to do anything. And even though it’s true, it hurts. I know it’s abnormal and I can’t stop it. This “fog” has taken over my personality. I thought I’d be happy when people stopped asking me to do things, because I felt bad saying no.. but now I don’t get invited or included because people just “know”."
1,"Im going to a mental hospital and now I feel like ""Im not depressed enough."". I feel unmotivated, lonely and like I don't have a goal in life. Massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now. I've thought about harming and killing myself multiple times. But lately, since I know I'm getting hospitalized, I feel like I don't deserve to go there. I've never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and I feel like I'm taking away a spot in that hospital from someone, whos problems are way worse... I definately know that I have thoughts from time to time, which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal, but they always go away at some point. It's so hard for me to know if I'm depressed. I always feel like I can't say I'm depressed, because there are probably others, who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems..."
1,Every time I wake up from sleeping I’m just like *sigh* “fuck.”. Or sometimes I’ll be doing anything and i stop for a second and I’m say under my breath “fuck I hate my life dude.”
1,"Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy. I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me
I know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it"
1,"I've showered every day for 5 days.. I know that this is probably pathetic, but my depression got very bad and I didn't shower for months, now I'm back on track, going to try and keep going in every day now.

Sorry if I bothered you."
1,"When I talk about myself, I feel selfish. When I ask others questions about themselves, I'm sad because they don't ask me questions back.. F*ck this... Not having a single true friend that genuinely cares really sucks..."
1,"I’m going to kill myself. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in ten years, but I have a burning feeling inside of me that my life will end on my own terms, when I am ready, and I don’t know how I feel about it. "
1,"I hate that time is passing so fast, and I'm still the same depressed shit.. I seriously want a change in my life. In terms of my social life, love life, everything... It's been 3 years I'm trying to find a change and yet I'm still the same. For 3 years I am the same shitty person, and still counting...

I want this to end."
1,"Anyone else feel like they're just trying to survive rather than live life?. During a conversation with a friend I came to the realization that in my existence I don't feel like I'm trying to ""live life"". I I feel like I'm more trying to survive, just get through each day without collapsing mentally.  

Anyone else? 

Edit: thank you guys for the response. I'm sorry that people feel this way, but I take solace in the fact that I'm not alone."
1,"If the moods of normal people fall between ""happy"" and ""sad"", the moods of depressed people fall between ""distracted"" and ""miserable"".. Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success."
1,"I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.. Just like the title says I am 58 M.
I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "
1,"Why do non-depressed people think depression is about being sad all the time.. I don't feel sad. I don't feel much, actually, if anything."
1,"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.. To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.



Edit: Thank you for the support everyone. I can't reply to every comment but be sure that your words mean a lot to me :)"
1,"It's like I'm chronically lazy. Whatever I do or tell myself, I'm too lazy to accomplish anything. Even if it's something I really enjoy or look forward to, I just can't finish it. Time escapes me. And then my parents come and yell at me for being lazy, and then I zone out of even longer, and the cycle repeats.

Will I ever be an efficient, useful human? I think not. I asked myself this 3 years ago. I have not improved. I have not changed. How does one change, when I can't make myself /do/ anything?"
1,"February 22nd 2020. I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this. I just don’t feel much except weariness anymore and I’m tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me :)"
1,"idk if this is just me. when i’m around my friends i feel like i want to be in their conversation i want to laugh and smile at their jokes and contribute with my own stories but i just can’t.  like i physically couldn’t even if i tried i always end up just sitting there looking at them listening and not contributing even though i so desperately want to. 

idk sorry"

1,"I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.. I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks"
1,"Anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes?. I’m in my mid twenties and I feel all I do is sit around and mope. This is supposed to be the golden age of people’s lives? I’ve accepted that I am different than other people who know
How to live fully. But what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be. It feels like I took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet. Like i am responsible for my sadness and there’s nothing I seem to be able to do about it

1,Does 2018 seem like a blur to anyone else?. I woke up today realizing how little of the past year I actually remember. I can remember bits and pieces but otherwise its just a blur.
1,"Do you ever wonder if you are really just selfish, lazy and manipulative person who convinced youself that you're depressed to feel better about it?. I felt like this very often lately. It's terrifies me. I keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? Or is it merely a comforting thoungt I am desperately clinging to?

(Sorry for my terrible english.)"
1,"Anyone else get depressed simply over the fact that their own life is so boring and repetitive?. This happens to me everytime I read a really good book/manga, watch a really good tv show/anime/movie, or listen to an amazing song/track. I get so engrossed in it that once it ends, I remember my shitty boring life that isn't going anywhere, and I just begin to cry, simply because of how benign and mundane my life is. I just want to escape my life to go to that distant place that I read about, watch or listen to.

I wish everything existed."
1,"I socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out.. It seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. A big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that I am glad. It's not like they haven't reached out before. They did, and I was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult.

A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. I saw tonight through her Instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason.

I'm not sure who I am if I'm such a terrible friend.  Not sure how to make it better."
1,"I lost my personality.. I’ve just realized that I haven’t been myself for awhile. I used to be really funny but I don’t make jokes anymore, I’m barely personable and I don’t talk to people unless they speak to me first. I’m such a fucking robot and I didn’t even realize it. So that’s fun.

1,"Does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time?. Lately I’ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that I’m not really interested in doing anything. I don’t want to be seen by people, so I dont leave my house. I spend a lot of time watching tv and if I’m not doing that I’m browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing. I feel like I’m wasting my life but I don’t know how to change."
1,"Has anyone else seen a significant drop in their IQ as a result of their mental illness?. Ever since I've had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away. I used to be sharp, in many ways I was above average even. Nowadays, my grades are failing, I have a hard time keeping up with conversation, and new ideas are difficult. Today, I tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me, like I just couldn't get the full idea. What has happened to me? Is this common with the other people on this subreddit? "
1,"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion. Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... "

1,"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out. I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying."
1,"No one showed. I should have expected that.. I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."
1,"Everything hurts. My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good. 

But after last night, I feel like nothing has changed and I‘m in the exact same spot again.
Those panic attacks scare the shit out of me.

EDIT:
To every single stranger who commented on this post: I wanna thank you. Your words mean so much, you have no idea. 

Please stay strong, the sun will rise again. For all of us."
1,"I sold my guns.. They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

1,"Does anyone else’s depression make them feel dumb? Or...unable to focus on school work or semi difficult tasks?. Information in class is difficult to obtain. As I’m usually having anxiety attacks and trying to talk myself down. If not that I’m just mindlessly taking notes. Not really focused on what my professor is saying. When I look at a question it makes my head hurt. Literally. I just want to put crumble the paper, shut my laptop screen, and lie down. As a matter of fact I don’t want to do anything but stay in my room. It has a full bathroom attached so my favorite thing to do is shower and watch Netflix. I do have a few friends so they randomly come in and out. But I have no desire to be sociable. I’m a shit friend. Now I’m rambling. Help

Edit: Thank you for everyone that actually replied. Means a lot to me :,) I’ll try to reply to everyone ASAP "
1,"I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me. When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this."
1,"I am no longer a 21yo, unemployed, kissless virgin living with my parents!. I am 22 now

How are all you other people doing today?


Edit: Well, this got bigger than I expected. Thank you for all the comments, and for the birthday wishes!"
1,"Anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others?. In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. 

Are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?"
1,"Casually suicidal?. Is anyone else “casually suicidal”? Like, you’re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it’s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process. It’s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them."
1,"Does anybody sometimes hope they get sick, so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people?. I just want disappear but I am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it. Suiciding also affects all the people who know you. Why did he do that? Did I treat him wrong. My parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal. 

Getting sick in a way that I couldn't be healed and die would be like an escape from this world. "
1,"Does anyone else live in their own head?. I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?"
1,"Why can't people understand I'm not just being lazy, I just feel unable to move. No I'm not staying in bed until 3pm because I think it's cool, funny or that I'm lazy. It's because I can't bring myself to get up.
I'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. This isn't how I want things to be. "
1,"I feel too sensitive to exist. Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

Edit: this post is open to anyone wanting to express their feelings. Unite fellow fragile people :)

Edit #2! Thank you for all of the replies and helpful advice. I know I’ll be coming back to re-read many of these messages. Y’all are getting upvotes! 
I know I’m in need of a therapist, still it was nice to write down these thoughts here. I posted this during a dark moment, woke up feeling better.
I’ll do my best to reply. Stay safe, indoors!"
1,"Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR: a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.]. The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. "
1,"Anyone else feel like they go through each day just waiting to go to bed?. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I feel like I wake up each day just to wait to go to sleep at night.  I'm almost 27 and I just quit my job that I was overqualified for a couple of months ago because my psychiatrist and I came to the conclusion that the nature of the job was not good for my PTSD or OCD.  Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take.  I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.  I just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore.."
1,"I've thought about killing myself for so long I've forgotten that's supposed to be a red flag.. I'm too chickenshit to do it though. I'm too afraid of whatever potential afterlife awaits me, and I feel too guilty about how it would affect some of my family. 

I dunno...the idea of suicide used to scare the shit out of me, but it's become such a mundane, frequent thing that I've become numb and desensitized to it. I feel like it's no longer a threat since I would have done it by now if I'd really do it."
1,"You can never have an honest conversation about suicide. When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "
1,"As of today, I'm no longer a depressed teenager!. ...Now I'm just a depressed guy in his twenties.

This sucks."
1,"This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:. When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""
1,"I hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention. Of course they want attention, they need HELP.. How else are you supposed to get help if no one knows?"
1,"Has your memory gotten worse with your depression?. My memory is absolutely terrible now, to the point where I second guess myself about whether something really happened or not. I can still remember information as well as I normally did. But for the life of me I cannot clearly recall highly emotional interactions (normally negative). I can replay the situation once in the direct aftermath, but then I’ll keep questioning whether or not I imagined certain things. The only thing I can confidently say I remember is on a scale of 1-10 how shitty I felt during said situation. Little details slip away and I don’t trust my recollection of what actually happened. I always end up asking someone who was there if my recollection of the situation is correct and it almost always is, but I keep doubting my memory."

""You love to sign huh?"" 
And he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesn't mind my terrible scribble. He even smiled and told me to have a good day. This little interaction made my day.

1,"Does anyone else want to die without committing suicide"". For quite a while now I've been pretty bummed out, and whenever I am just crossing the road or on the top of a building I just envy that somehow my death could be accidental. Or just wish that someone would kill me for no reason, I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal but I just don't want to be here anymore and it would be easier on my family if they thought it was an accident. Does anyone else feel this way?"
1,"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer.... About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)"
1,"I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.. Why does this happen to me.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading. This is KU/KW(before I changed my name and after initials) 14/6/2020✌️


Sorry I should’ve mentioned it. I’m in my second half on year 13. College.  I failed my GCSE. I didn’t get enough sleep. I ran away during one exam and all the others I couldn’t concentrate. I kept zoning out. I didn’t get into my a level classes. I haven’t made any new friends. My anxiety hasn’t lessened.in fact my social life has gone far worse.im finding it hard to keep up with all things pain I feel mentally."
1,"Does anyone else feel like they’re falling behind everyone else their age?. I’m 23 years old. I’ve failed two years in a row of university, I’m back living with my parents, I’ve never had a job, I can’ drive, I’ve never had a partner, I’ve never fallen in love. I’ve never done so many things that people my age have done.

I know that really, that doesn’t matter, and that people will say I’ll get there in my own time. But I get so down thinking about how the people I went to school with are so ahead of me, and I’m just stuck here, not even living, just surviving . I hate myself so much and I feel completely hopeless about my life. 

Please let me know if you feel anything like this, your experiences, or even successes! 

^That ^actually ^felt ^really ^good ^to ^get ^off ^my ^chest, ^haha"
1,"Every time I try to speak about my depression, it sounds like a cliche. So I keep it to myself.. I have tried to write something in this group so many times but I always delete it (I've typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past, but haven't hit send)

So fuck it. 

I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. 
I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love."
1,"Anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden?. This is definitely because of my anxiety, and I know that I really am not a burden to these people.

But does anyone feel the same?"
1,"Do you ever just look at people and think, ""Wow, Im a giant loser"". I just need to know im not alone. Im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than I have because I wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone. I mean right now while I cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because I cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals I cant focus for more than half an hour before I take a fifteen minute break. Tldr: dae feel like a loser and hate life"
1,"What depression isn't.. Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."
1,"Has anyone ever had a period of being okay, only to crash back down into the blackness without any discernable reason why?. I struggled for a fair while, probably years. The last two months or so I’ve felt great, however since yesterday I’ve just seemingly hit rock bottom again, can’t see any positivity in anything, can’t motivate myself to do basic things. I’m trying to tell myself it’s just a passing blip, however I’m low key worried I’m going back to the bad place, anyone have similar situations/experiences?

EDIT: I wrote this and fell asleep shortly afterwards, I’m blown away by the responses. I’m going to read through every comment and try and reply throughout my day at work."
1,"I’ve had to stop my own mom from killing herself. I’ve had to stop her from beating me or my siblings. I’ve pulled her off my dad. She’s crazy. And it’s been like this for 17 years. Thanks, mom (and dad). Happy holidays.. My parents suck. I was in foster care when I was a child. So were my siblings. Just some crazy ass shit we had to go through. I feel disturbed, sometimes.

It’s so weird to know that other kids are vibing in their rooms this holiday break. I’m just trying to get my parents to get their shit together."
1,does the idea of living the rest of your life just sound exhausting. like the past 18 years have felt so awful even tho i have lived a pretty decent life. i feel like there is no escape.
1,Anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts?. even though i know i'm glossing over the bad memories....at least there were good ones as well
1,"My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on.... She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I've never been with any other girl but her.. 
I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living. Somebody tells me I should be glad to still be in this life. But as I see it, it's a curse, a damnation. She doesn't suffer anymore, as I am every second of my life now.. 
Just wanted to open up to you..."
1,"Does anyone make drafts and ends up not posting?. I have a ridiculous amount of drafts here talking about how I feel. I don’t know why. Maybe I just want the support of others who possibly feel the same or I’m embarrassed. I feel like I can’t go to my friends or family to talk about it. My family would immediately send me to a psych ward (I tried to OD a few years back and was locked up). My friends would call me dramatic. 

So, I guess this is my stepping stone to post here.

Edit: Wow it’s kind of relieving to see that everyone feels the same. But hey, let’s support each other?"
1,"Depression: The disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends, and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you.. Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that ""understand what I'm dealing with"" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. "
1,"""You're a goner"" - my therapist lol. During therapy yesterday, the topic of my past experiences with therapists came up. My therapist asked how many I'd seen in the past.

Me: ""8, 3 of them in the past few years.""

Her: ""Ohhh..you're a goner. Whenever I hear that from people - seen that many therapists - I feel like they're a goner."" 

Her: ...proceeds to sorta walk this back.... ""I'm pessimistic, but optimistic too."" 

It was kinda funny. I mean damn I agree with her, chances are I'm a fucking goner and there's no hope, but aren't you supposed to help be building my optimism and hope? If I wanted to hear that there's no hope for me, I'd just re-read literally any of my journal entries from the past 3-4 years. 

I could't help but laugh about it later though."
1,Have you ever felt so sad that you actually feel a sharp sore pain in your heart?. I feel so stupid. And so worthless. I feel like I try so hard and my trying is either unwanted or unappreciated. I feel like I burden everyone I meet just by being around them. I worry about all the wrong things never any of the right ones. Sometimes I just want to up and go and escape all of the chaos. And other times I feel on top of the world. Today I’m at the very bottom. 
1,"I don’t know if i’m still depressed. I don’t feel numb or sad, but i feel unmotivated, unfulfilled, blank and flat. I don’t want to end it all, but i don’t care if i live or die.. I can almost feel pain and numbness creeping into me sometimes, but it just goes away as soon as it came.  I honestly don’t even know what i want anymore."
1,"Yesterday I finally went to the doctors to speak about my mental health!!!!. He has diagnosed me with depression and given me anti depressants. Also recommended seeing a counselor. Furthermore, I went back to play hockey last night for the first time in 5 years. After a year of feeling awful, I am ready to turn it around.

Edit: thanks very much to everybody who commented such thoughtful, positive and kind comments. Also thanks for the advice throughout too. The response made me feel so happy and like I'd really taken a big step. Also thank you to the very kind person who gave me a silver!!!"
1,"Am I becoming less intelligent?. Does anyone else here find that long periods of isolation and depression makes their brains feel slower? Like holding an conversation requires more effort and problem solving is a lot more difficult? Even trying to formulate basic thoughts into text requires some hard thinking? I feel so foggy, detached and slow...."
1,"You don't get it. ""It gets better"" ""Stop thinking about it"" ""get over it"", etc.

Stop. Saying. That. 

I hate it as much as you do, I just want to be free from my mind. I am my worst enemy. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking bad, you have no idea, and I hate my situation, I hate my life and I am trying to control my emotions... It's **NOT** easy. 

Did you ever get in your car and thought: Huh, maybe this time I will die? And feel almost disappointed you haven't finished in a car crash?  
Have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like: Damn, it was close!

Started to cut vegetables, and thought about hurting yourself?  
Hang yourself? Fall off a bridge? 

There are honestly thousands of ways I could have ended my life, for many horrible reasons, my own demons eating me, my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth.  I feel like shit and like I don't deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better. I am lost. I am alone. I feel horribly... horribly numb. 

*I just want to die....*"
1,"Does anyone else feel that people only “tolerate” you?. I hate thinking this way. I have a few friends, but I’ve never felt I was truly “in” the group.  We “hang out” together, but most of the conversations would be other people talking. Sometimes I wonder if they only take advantage of me because I would try my hardest not to lose them so I won’t be alone. 

Do they really enjoy being around me? Do they like me? I wonder...if I should find new people. But i don’t want to be alone.

Edit: waved hi to a friend. She completely ignored me. :/"
1,"Does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years?. I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 

No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting."
1,"I feel like I’m not as important in other people’s lives as they are in mine. I have very few friends, and even then I’m not really close to them. It’s VERY hard for me to make friends, and even harder to open up to them. I know they have plenty of other friends they’re much closer to and it wouldn’t really make much of a difference if I disappeared. Meanwhile, if they disappeared from my life, I would pretty much have no one. I just wish I really mattered to someone."
1,"Why do I feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me?. No matter how good a conversation goes, I always end up so depressed and crying because I feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me. Especially if I did something ‘embarrassing’...

Any advice?"
1,"Hospital bills after suicide attempt. I attempted suicide about three years ago, and I'm still struggling to pay the hospital bills. Yesterday, I received a bill for a charge I didn't even know about.

It just doesn't make any sense. I wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now I have to pay them for it. Plus I have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. I feel like I'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills. 

Why couldn't they let me just die?"
1,"I took a shower for the 2nd day a row :). It might not be much to most others, but it’s a pretty big deal for me. I normally go weeks with showering properly…"
1,"I created my first reddit because my boyfriend was drowning in his depression, and I wanted desperately to help him. Since then, I've gained more insight and listened to all you beautiful people and because of you, I've learned how to better help him.. I'm not sure if this is right right place to post this, and I hope I don't upset anyone. (this is my second acct by the way, I wanted to create a new one yesterday for personal reasons) but the title pretty much says everything. I wanted to thank each one of you for being vulnerable with your feelings and helping one another, as you've helped me help the man I love. I hope nothing but the best for each of you and I hope this means something to someone. "
1,"This is horrible, but... Does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital, being bedridden for a while?. I picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits. 

I picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that I have.

I picture myself finally being able to do what I want- to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities.

I picture my ex visiting me, and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is.."
1,"Unemployed Therapist. I’m a therapist- but recently lost my job to my depression. It was a personal choice, but I felt that everyone I worked with wanted me to leave. I have severe issues with self-doubt. I feel like a fraud, like my MSEd is not legit, I didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.

My family is financially supportive when I need them but not much else. My mom just tells me to take my meds (I do), or she offers me her meds. I told my sister earlier this year that I was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband I’m going to go insane!”

My own husband is patient but not very supportive. I’ve been on the couch since Monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how I am. I know he wants me to return to “normal”. I worry he’ll give up on me.

I interviewed for another job last week and this week. It was an adoption counselor position, something I’ve always dreamt of. I did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. I didn’t get the job. 

While still working, I found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support I needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. I made the mistake of telling her that I smoke weed sometimes. She then began questioning my work and my physical health. She also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg Prozac), as I was somehow “putting my health at risk”. Needless to say, I plummeting deeper into depression.

I spoke to my PCP and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. After two days, I was so sick I had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. When I asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”

I guess I feel hopeless and alone. I have two little boys who are 3 and 6. My oldest son has severe special needs. I am able to take care of them, but I cannot get off the couch to do anything else. My body hurts, I can’t eat anything. My husband and kids went to breakfast and I stayed home to watch TV in my pajamas.

I feel a bit like I’m already dead, and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me."
1,"Anyone else take days to recover from a insult?. Every fucking time... first I ignore it and just brush it off then it pops back in my head and I'm stuck on it for days it eats away at me.. I manifest the insult and let it define me. The most common one is a insult to my intelligence, every time it happens I'm fucked up for a week."
1,"Attempted suicide last night. Now I'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.. So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

Lots of love,

Jasmine "
1,"Anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems?. Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."
1,Depressed but in 2 0 1 8. Spent New year's alone. Here's to another shit year. 🍷
1,"People wonder why depressed or suicidal people don’t get help. When I was four years old, my family was going to leave our country to live in the United States. They abandoned everything so my brother and I could live a good life. How am I supposed to tell the people to gave up everything, worked every single day, learned an entire language through just talking to others, and moved away from their loved ones for me to have a good life, that I don’t even want my life anymore? How am I supposed to tell them I don’t want to live the life they wanted for me anymore? How am I supposed to tell them that? It would break their heart. It would break everyone’s heart. 

I can’t do that to them."
1,"Today my depression won, I dropped out of college. My depression won today, I couldn’t keep going as I was. I thought I could handle it, I really did. I was excited to study my major, but I couldn’t handle it. I started missing classes, forgetting to take proper care of myself. My room became a mess, and so did my grades.

My parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help I need, going to keep me under their supervision. I feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when I knew I could never handle it with the way things are. My heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. 

I’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once I get home. At least I’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. "
1,"Anyone else's depression hit the hardest at night?. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the silence of every night is a reminder of how alone I feel. "
1,"If someones willing to read this, itd make my night.. Coming from an already broken heart:
Okay, so. Yesterday was prom. I care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. We went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously does

Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. For anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. She didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. Kind of confused.

Update: She is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight."
1,"Depression is addicting. Why does it always feel easier to live in this discomfort than being happy. I get better and always feel myself coming back to this state.

It’s like my mind is tricking me into thinking being depressed is easier. Any time something remotely bad happens I think, well I can always kill myself if it gets worse.

Life is overwhelming me. I need help."
1,"I’m going to end my life soon.. People have been nice to me and tried to help, but it doesn’t really work. Nothing really works, because I’m a bad fucked up person. It’s okay though... I won’t be here much longer. I’m just sort of confused on how to tell everyone and how it will feel to hang myself. I don’t know... I’m scared. But it’s much better than living. I will tell all my friends goodbye soon anyways... I think everyone will be able to get through it. It’s not that big of a deal when you really think about the bad person I am. I know I said it a million times but for real this time. I’m ready to do it. I’ve been broken a lot, but this time I can feel that it’s the last thing to break. Usually I’m open to compassion from others but not this time. I feel fixed on dying and I don’t want help. I don’t care anymore really. I don’t want to talk about it anymore or make any online friends anymore or anything fucking thing. I realized I have to do it. I knew for a while it was my destiny but I was too scared to do it. But it’s better to die now then suffer from suicidal thinking for 10-20 years and just feel even more worse things. If I can’t handle this what can I handle.... and to everyone that was mean to me or is just a piece of shit I hate them so much . I jsut have so much hate. I’d really like to hurt myself

Edit: I’m trying to reply to everyone but it’s a lot. Sorry if I don’t reply to you. I appreciate the comments though.

Edit(2): thanks a lot.... I feel better and I’m gonna try to keep on living thanks to you guys. I’d love to reply to everyone but it’s really hard. Just know I appreciate everyone who commented."
1,"If you get a PM from someone claiming that religion with cure your depression, please click ""report"" and then ignore it!. It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to ""save"" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  Don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators. "
1,"Regular Check-In, and some info about high-risk posts.. Welcome to the (ir)regular check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us. If you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "
1,"Depression is the worst pain I've ever felt.. It feels like falling down a dark bottomless pit, wondering if your fall will ever end. And as you look back to where you fell from -the only way out- you  see it receding further and further into the distance, the light becoming dimmer and smaller while the hole in which you are falling becomes deeper, darker, and tighter. The light above you eventually disappears and leaves you in complete darkness. You can only look down, towards the end, hoping it will come soon."
1,Do you ever cope by imagining a person/world that makes you feel safe?. I think we might become stronger if we can imagine things are perfect when reality is falling apart. It doesn't always work but you can always try
1,"I’m only 19 but I can’t shake this feeling that my life is over.. I feel like I wasted my youth. I get so nostalgic for high school and being that young again even though it was one of the roughest periods of my life. I just have this existential dread hanging over me. Like what’s left after this? I wasted what’s supposed to be some of the best years of your life and now I’m old and my future will be working 9-5 and paying bills while living paycheck to paycheck trying to survive. I don’t know how anyone is truly happy in life.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the responses. I’ve read each one and they seriously made my day so much better. I’m going to visit my college’s counseling service and attempt to make sense of my brain."
1,"Today I realized I'm a panda.. Proof:

* The majority of food I eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)

* I have low-no sex drive (due to antidepressants)

* I sit/lay around most of the day

* People care more about me staying alive than I do 


I honestly don't know if this funny, sad, or somewhere in between.

"
1,"I feel like I'm becoming dumber everyday.. I literally cannot focus on anything. I can't pay attention in class. I can't study. I can't read a book. I can't even pay attention to video games. I can't watch a 10 min YouTube video. I'm constantly zoning out. I'm just mindlessly going through life without really enjoying anything.

Edit : Thanks for all your replies. I didn't know so many of you were feeling the same way as me. Glad to know I'm not alone. Gives me a bit of hope."
1,"Can you be suicidal but be scared to die?. I think about dying a lot. I think about the affect it would have and what would happen to the very few people who care about me. Sometimes I wish everything would stop and I could just be gone. 
But I’m terrified of death, I think it’s my anxiety taking over. 
I feel like I can’t even be suicidal correctly, which I guess isn’t a bad thing but it makes everything worse in my fucked up head making me feel like more of a failure."
1,"My mother died unexpectedly about 3 hours ago. The pain is paralyzing.. I was at my friends bday party at a bar when my father called me and told me that my mother laid to down to take a nap but never woke up. He was in bad shape when I got there so I decided to spend the night. I’m laying here hoping it’s just a nightmare but it’s really happening. She was my best friend and I don’t know how I’m going to go on.

1,"Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?. A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper. "
1,"It’s 5am I Have Not Slept and I Am Spiraling. EDIT: *obligatory “wow this blew up* I found this subreddit in early hours of the morning, very anxious and upset about life in general. I don’t even know if I’m using it right haha. But I wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a “damn me too” because it really helps knowing I’m not alone in my feelings.
I am currently seeing a therapist. He is great I’ve been going to him for a while, but unfortunately it’s a little hard for me to see him because he’s at my university’s counseling center and he’s pretty much always booked.
I so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave. It’s definitely something I’m going to look into, and it wasn’t anything I was aware of until now, so thank you for mentioning it!
Someone suggested I wasn’t going to class just because. I feel like for clarification’s sake I should mention the reason I haven’t been is because I got very sick (I know these absences are excused) and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult. I live about 20 minutes away from campus, so it’s not like I can just run out of my dorm into my class haha.



I don’t know really know where else to go or how to format this so I guess I’ll just bullet point Why My Life Is Extra Shitty Right Now:

• College is kicking my ass right now. I haven’t been to class in like 3 weeks 1) what’s the point in going anymore I am so far behind by now and 2) I don’t even want to be in college right now and it’s taken me a year and a half to really realize I only went because I felt pressured to by peers and family. I want to drop out so badly, because I know I’m just not in the headspace to do it right now, but my family expects a lot out of me because I was “smart” in high school and I don’t want them all to hate me and also I will lose a pretty big scholarship if I quit going and shakdnhdiebd (not to mention NO ONE ELSE MY AGE is having any problems with this, just me which makes me feel 50x worse about the whole thing. like I have friends taking 18 hours this semester and I’m so behind and I’m only doing 13 haha what a LOSER amrite)

• I found out last week that I’m losing my job. I work retail and yeah I could find another job easy, but I was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store I work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan. Not to mention it’s almost holiday season, I don’t want to be the newbie at a new job when it’s already gonna be hectic and I love the place I work at right now and I’m just sad in general it’s gonna be gone

• I started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes I feel fine but mostly I’m just exhausted and can’t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon, which REALLY doesn’t help my whole not going to class thing
I’m just so stressed and have a constant headache I go to see my therapist later today which is good I guess but I just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my head

if anyone read this then thank you, I’ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha"
1,Who else desperately craves stable employment but has crushing anxiety and absolutely no idea what they want to pursue?. I have had this realization lately and it is very crap :(
1,do you live with a person who always brings you down?. i do and i hate my life because of it
1,"I desperately want someone to reach out to me, but when they do, I fucking hate it.. Anybody else do this? If so, why? And what the fuck?

You find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation, full of all kinds of self-hate, wishing desperately for some kind of validation, help, or support of some kind, wishing your friends (or really anyone) would actually reach out and give a shit...

...and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do? 

Seriously, what the fuck? I’ve noticed this pattern in myself and I can’t understand why. 

It feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that. It just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder, which logically I know makes it worse, but I can’t seem to break the cycle.

Anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this? Because I’m at a loss here."
1,"'You can talk to me anytime'. People are just full of shit. Like they say that I can 'talk to them anytime' but then the next moment, when I'm no longer convenient for them, they don't respond for a day or too. Or they don't actually want to talk and feel like they've done their civil duty with that sick one-liner. 

Okay I've said my piece, back to the slums for me"
1,"When developing a crush on someone, does anyone else get depressed as fuck?. Everytime I see a human being that makes my heart stop I get really sad because I've convinced myself that I will never, never be able to have someone like that...if anyone at all."
1,"Am i the only one that doesnt go to sleep because they dont want to get up the next day?. This has been going on for about a year, I just don't see the point in going to sleep if I'm waking to another shitty day."
1,"Anyone else ""functionally depressed""?. You can still go to work/school, spend time with friends and family, and act like a totally normal person but feel completely dead inside. 

I'm in school and I make decent grades. My friends go to karaoke bars regularly to hang out and drink. It feels so weird singing emotionally charged songs while feeling absolutely nothing. Feels like living a lie."
1,"Does anyone else feel like there's a voice inside your head, like an inner demon, telling you how much you suck and keeping you down all the time?. It's like, this inner demon wants to push me into his abyss and I'm holding with all the strenght I have but it's been hard to hold on for much longer. I hate this demon."
1,"Does anyone else welcome the idea of an accidental death?. I've recently come to terms with my depression. Ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think I will ever do it. But every day, when I'm driving to school, I have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. I think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. I think it would be better for my family. The memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. I would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. They would just say it was an unfortunate accident. Does anyone else think like this?"
1,"Do you ever feel like you're just not cut out for this world?. Inb4 comments like ""you're just acting helpless"" or ""what makes you different from everyone else?"" I'm not trying to act helpless or like I'm different. I just feel like I'm too weak. There a lot of things that upset me that... shouldn't. Like I'm terrified of confrontation, to the point where I start shaking. And I can't have arguments. Everything makes me exhausted, after 10 minutes of badminton I couldn't breathe, even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache. It's like I have no energy, I get so tired when doing schoolwork. And I'm very sensitive to what kind of advice I get, stuff like ""tough love"" gets me close to hyperventilating and I'll be upset for the rest of the day. I just don't know what to do, and I admit it, sometimes I just want to quit. I guess I just have to try harder, but often I feel like I'm too weak and sensitive and I won't make it in the world, and that things would be better if I stopped existing. "
1,"I'm not suicidal, but I genuinely just have no interest in anything, including being alive.. I'm an atheist and I just don't think there's any reason to have to go through such a waste of time, breathing on this planet for another 50-60 more years, if it just means I'll end up in the same place regardless of if I did something with myself or not.

I'm currently not studying, and I'm looking for a job. I went to a job/recruitment agency this morning, and they asked me a bunch of stuff that I was unable to give a proper answer to.

> ""So what's your dream job? :)""

\*shrug\* er... I don't have one.

> ""Well, if you had to pick a job what would it be?""

I really don't know... I guess one where I don't have to talk to people.

> ""It says here you were recently studying. Can I ask what exactly you studied?""

I just graduated in Social Sciences.

> ""Oh, that's great! We can help you get a job related to that. :)""

Er... I don't really have any interest in the field.

> ""Then if I may ask... why did you study Social Sciences?""

\*shrug\* Old-fashioned parents expected me to go to university after school.

> ""Okay, moving on... what are your long-term or short-term goals?""

Er... I don't have any...

---

I just started tearing up half-way into answering the questions, thinking ""something's seriously wrong with me"" that I don't have any goals or dreams. I've never been ambitious my whole life. Even as a kid, when you're supposedly full of wonder and imagination, I never really had a ""I wanna be a rockstar/princess/astronaut!"" moment.

It was always just ""I have to go to school cos I have to"", ""I have to study hard cos I have to"", ""I have to get good grades cos I have to"". And now that I'm out in the world, I still haven't figured out what the fuck's the point of anything."
1,"Does anybody else's mind immediately go to death as a solution?. Every time a new problem comes up, no matter how big or small, I sometimes can't help but think, ""this is such a pain. I'd rather be dead.""

For example, here recently I caused a minor car accident, and afterwards all I could think was 'How can I kill myself?' because of the guilt and all my other faults. It almost scared me at how viable it seems as a solution. No more suffering, no more being useless, no more stupid mistakes..."
1,"Could we get a hands up of those who do absolutely *nothing* all day every day?. Those with no school or work. 

If you browse Reddit 10 hours a day basically."
1,"People are too practical when it comes to depression. So many people don't understand that sometimes, someone just wants them to understand what they're going through. To be comforted emotionally instead of given practical advice. In moments of desperation I used to say stuff like: I'm a piece of shit,I deserve to die. I don't need someone telling me I'm wrong, or what next steps I should take to feel better like exercise or eat healthy. I need someone to just say: I'm sorry you feel that way, that sucks. That's all I need. Someone to acknowledge my feelings. Trying to fix an emotional problem practically is like someone trying to fix a broken leg by talking."
1,"I get a horrible comedown after fun days of socializing. After good times with friends, I get home and feel exceptionally lonely and empty.. Maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect? I dunno. It stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even ""good""."
1,"Sometimes I fantasize about someone catching me crying and asking if I'm ok.... 
Edit: so, I wasn't expecting this to blow up like this, thanks everyone for the positivity❤❤❤❤❤


I am very good at hiding my depression, my husband knows about it but never asks me if I'm ok, even though he's very supportive and doesn't hold it against me when he comes home and due to not feeling like existing I didn't do the dishes for example... I know I don't make anything easy by not letting it show, and always wearing a social mask (smile), but it would be good to open my heart to someone, that really wants to hear me..."
1,"I feel I am at the middle point where I don't 'deserve' being labeled depressed and I am not happy enough to be labeled healthy. Don't misunderstand this title, please. I am by no means saying depression is any kind of privilege - suggesting you can use 'the depression card' or whatnot. My point is that I feel my problems are irrelevant because I know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me. I feel I am not in a position to complain. Yet, I don't feel content. I feel more apathy than much else and I don't know if that is depression and I am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis. Some part of me believes I can solve this on my own, but another part asks, ""and how long will that take, considering your less than stellar situation, will and mindset?""

Oh, and then there's the part which definitely thinks I shouldn't waste my time writing this, which in turn may waste your time by reading this. I am just confused and a little tired. I seek no sympathy from you guys, but maybe someone can relate. I wish you all a good day."
1,"I hate the depression cycle. You know, the one where you hit “rock bottom” and you have a mental breakdown, talk to someone, and then suddenly feel motivated to do something about your shit self.. until you eventually feel awful again. Rinse repeat. 

It’s very tiring. "
1,"Ever get so depressed that you stop wanting to get better?. I'm at the point where I don't really want anything in life, even happiness. I know logically I could probably get better if I put my mind to it, but that thought just doesn't appeal to me anymore. It sounds weird putting it out in writing, but I was wondering if anyone else can relate to this. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you have a nice day."
1,"Does anyone have literally 0 friends or people to talk to?. Yes, literally 0. I kno we like to say we are lonely here, but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to, even if it's online. 

That being said I just havr to say that I am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound I often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak (even if I hate my voice and I find it grating). I am mostly okay with it...I think. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so I don't think about killing myself.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for replying to this, I had no idea it would blow up so much. I was very in my feelings when I made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself. I went to sleep and now I am feeling a little better. 

I promise I will take time to read all the replies and respond to everyone. I also want to thank everyone who sent me a private message, I will reply to those too, but at the moment I am just feeling overwhelmed cause I didint expect people to actually relate to this or reply. I know it sounds cheesy, but I just wish I could hug all of you."
1,"i fucking hate when that ""wtf am i doing with my life"" wave hits, and hopelessness that follows. sometimes it hits me at 2:49 in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room, sometimes in 4pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothing

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard"
1,"Does anyone else's body go into sleep mode when you're really depressed?. I've noticed the last few weeks, I've been sleeping a lot more during the day than I ever have, especially after interacting with my dad. It's not even something I can control, my body just shuts down for a few hours. The most infuriating part of it is that it screws up my sleep schedule, so I'll struggle more than usual to sleep."
1,"Just became a father, and death sounds better every day.. ---Update---

I just made an appointment to discuss therapy and/or medication changes. I've been on this road before (pre-baby depression) with a lack of results, but for the sake of my wife and child, I'm willing to try again. Wish me luck everybody.

---End Update---

Alright, parents and child-lovers everywhere - get ready to hate me. I don't blame you, and really I don't care. I can't be unapologetically honest with anyone I know personally, so you strangers on the internet are the only outlet I can use.

I have dealt with depression since middle school, so this bullshit isn't new to me. About 2 months ago, I and my wife had our first baby, and those two months have been the worst time of my life. I have been in dark places before, but becoming a dad has taken me to hellacious places in my mind that I never knew existed within me. For starters, I feel no love or connection to my baby at all. All I see is an obnoxious living ball of needs. I never wanted kids growing up, in fact, I have always hated babies and children under 13-15 years old. I only agreed with my wife to try for a baby because 1) My wife wanted a baby for most of her life, and I wanted to make her happy. 2) I thought the parental instinct and unconditional love would come naturally when she was born and I started interacting with her.

You always hear parents say that they love their kids more than anything, and they are worth all of the trouble they cause, but I strongly disagree. I want our baby out of my life until they are at least a teenager, maybe even forever.

I am a very analytical person, and I have gone over all of the feasible options available to me, and they are all so fucking horrible to me that I honestly prefer suicide over facing the rest of my choices and their consequences.

I love my wife with all of my heart, so the idea of divorce tears me apart even if it would let me be rid of our baby. I know what kind of life the two of them would live if we did divorce, and there is no way I could be that cruel. So I am essentially stuck staying in my marriage and keeping the baby, and I just have to suck it up and live with the worst fucking mistake I ever made. The idea of raising a baby, toddler, child, teen, etc is literally Hell for me and experiencing it is proving to be worse than the idea alone. Hence why suicide has started sounding so good.

My depression has always seemed to revolve around the notion that ""Life takes too much effort/work"", which really fucking sucks since a baby is nothing but Goddamn effort/work. I am literally forced to care for and sustain the worst trigger I have ever encountered for my depression. The more I interact with my baby, the worse my mental health gets. The less I interact with my baby, the shittier I feel about what kind of father I'm being, which also leads to a decline in my mental health. No matter what I do, I am in a perpetual downward spiral.

I don't want to hurt our baby, but I can't deny that the temptation arises when it won't stop crying. I find myself visualizing terrible things when I am desperately hoping it will shut the hell up.

I can't even put all of the words down for some of my feelings lately. I feel so horrible about the way I see my own child and even worse about the fact I can't do anything to make it better.

And before anyone asks, yes I have talked to my wife about this and to make a long story short, It didn't really help my mental dilemma. Nothing got worse by talking about it (besides learning she hopes to have a 2nd kid one day (hell no)), but she did not have any input that I had not already thought of myself."
1,"I was depressed as a teenager, worked hard and got my own place and all the things I thought would make me feel better, and now I'm more depressed than ever in my mid 20s.. I can't maintain friendships. I can't connect with people. I push people away when I need them the most.

It is so hard to describe the feeling and experience. I look forward to my free time, I plan and structure my life so I have it. But when I reach that point it is like I've gotten dumped off, with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips.

I should be enjoying life more than ever, but I don't have a social structure to lean on. I've grown apart from my friends and family. I make plans for my days off with people, but when they come I cancel them.

I just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows. The only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches. I probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for 5 minutes until it would stop moving completely and then I would smack it again. It was a boring, tortuous, and arduous experience but I wouldn't stop."
1,"Do you guys ever think ""was i ever really happy?"". Looking back on my life everything always seems so grey and dull."

My life is passing away and I realize I will never amount to what I daydream and it made my depression go to a dangerous state. Do you guys do this too?

Edit: wow guys thanks for all the comments and upvotes it’s so incredibly reassuring that I’m not the only one with this. Thanks for all the support and advice I really take it to heart. I still haven’t really solved this problem but knowing I’m not the only one really helps thanks everyone I truly wish you all the best thank you"
1,"I did it. After a month of udder crippling depression, not only did I wake up and get out of bed I got dressed in a nice outfit and put some make up on... I think things are getting better. "
1,"I decided to open up to my mother about my anxiety problems. She understood and we'll make an appointment with the doctor. Hopefully I'm on the right path to healing. :)

edit: I wanna thank each and every one of you for the supportive and very kind comments. I love you all and I wish the best to all of you! We're all strong fighters here! Stay safe :)"
1,"Wife cheated on me, is threatening me, I feel lost.. I caught my wife lying about being somewhere when she was actually at a hotel. She’s threatening me with divorce if we don’t open our relationship. We have a two year old daughter. I just graduated college and all of my plans for graduation have fallen apart, I’ve been rejected from every fellowship I’ve applied to and interviewed for. I had a surgery two years ago that still is bothering me with complications. 

I can’t tell my wife, the only person I used to talk to about my depression or if I’m feeling suicidal.

I’m so tired of feeling this way. I’m in so much pain all of the time. I feel completely and utterly humiliated. I just want the pain to stop. Please help me. I can’t take this anymore. Please. I don’t know what to do. Fuck.

I don’t want to lose my daughter. I love her so much. I’m just so lonely, scared, and hurt. I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to deal with this pain anymore. 

Is there a point when it’s okay to stop? I loved my wife so much, she was everything to me. 

I feel so broken.

Edit: I have read every single comment on my post, and deeply appreciate all of your support. You’re all channeling the anger I’ve been suppressing for a few weeks now. My family is really well connected in the legal community, I’m just hesitant to pull the trigger and start asking for contacts. Word spreads pretty quick and I’m not sure I’m ready for everyone to know right now.

Im taking  all of your advice into consideration and am going to take some concrete steps towards strengthening my position against her threats."
1,"Does anybody here feel like they daydream all the time instead of living their life?. Like I said. Daydreaming about the things I'd want to happen; about the things I can do, but won't, because of my social anxiety, which lead to my depression. Daydreaming about having conversations with people I know that probably won't happen. Daydreaming about not being lonely...

It's fucking exhausting, knowing that I can't make any of those dreams come true even though there's literally nothing holding me back, except myself."
1,"Does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world?. This world favors strong character: confidence, self-respect, charisma, determination, fearlessness etc etc. Obviously I don't add up to any of those. In fact I'm downright opposite. My life so far has been a history of failures and regrets. I'm so sensitive it's honestly embarassing. At this point anything is enough to send me into an episode. I'm too fucking useless and repulsive to succeed anywhere in life. I find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world, where I actually have friends, where I don't loathe myself so much, where life doesn't seem pointless and I have a purpose

1,"Just saying “I have depression” feels like I’m minimizing what I’m actually experiencing. I really hate it when I try to explain to people what’s wrong and I don’t want to go into the nitty gritty due to a whole slew of reasons but saying “sorry, it’s my depression” just doesn’t seem to convey the weight and magnitude this illness has. I need a new name or word for it. "
1,"My wife committed suicide yesterday. My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  

I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 

Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. 


Edit: thank you all for your support. I promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an April's fool joke. I really wish it was. 

Edit 2: thank you again for all the support. I'm going to see someone today and Friday. The funeral is tomorrow. It's going to be a rough few days. "
1,"I don’t want to have kids because I don’t want them to experience depression. I’m only 16, but I’ve already made up my mind: I’m never going to have kids. I can’t stomach the thought of passing my depression down to them, or them having to grow up with a parent struggling with depression. It just wouldn’t be fair to them."
1,"Anyone else's 'okay' days still pretty fucking awful?. My okay days used to be decent, I wasn't particularly motivated or anything but I didn't feel like shit. Now my okay days are just days where I don't actively want to die but I still have suicidal thoughts and can't stop thinking about depressing shit unless I'm fully distracted which is really hard to achieve.

Edit: Thanks for all the words of support, it's really helped and I feel much better now I know it's not just me feeling this way, really appreciate it guys."
1,I think I've been depressed for so long that...... .... that it's a part of my personality now. The helplessness and pessimism is such an integral part of my life that I now feel like I have to cling to it; to let go of it would be akin to forming a completely new personality. Does that make sense?
1,"I’m so uncomfortable when people ask “What have you been up to” every time I see them.. It’s hard fumbling about trying to think of something interesting when all I do is go on YouTube, play video games and go to class. Usually, I just go “not much how about you”. It’s embarrassing and sad, but it’s not like I’m passionate about anything else. I wish I was.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold, stranger! "
1,I relapsed😔. I made an oath to myself to never stoop so low and to cut myself again. I made it to two months without doing it until today. I had so many emotions going through my body and I didn’t know what to do with it and so I just took it out on myself. I kept on going and going until I realize I had to stop because I almost covered my whole thigh. I’m sorry for triggering or being to graphic to anyone. I’m having a really hard time right now.
1,"Anyone else fantasize about leaving everything, running away, and starting over somewhere?. This has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years. I'm thinking, well, things can't get much worse, so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything. Maybe go to a different country and starting over. I've been binge watching ""Disappeared"" a lot and can really relate to many of the people who vanished all of a sudden."

None of my friends suspect anything at all because I’m the “happy strong” one of the group. But as soon as we all go home, I can’t help but feel like I’m worthless and everyone would be better off without me. "
1,"I miss myself.. I miss you so much. How did I get here? I look at old photos and I see a happy girl with insecurities, yes, but someone who was comfortable with who they were.

So how did I get here? I feel so alone. Who can I come home to if I can't come home to myself."
1,"Girlfriend attempted suicide. I'm a wreck.. I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

*EDIT* *UPDATE*

I saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. She is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time. 

I feel a bit better about things. Thanks to all of you for your support. 

*EDIT*

She gets to come home this Sunday. Time to clean the fuck out of her house for her. =)"
1,"Anyone ever been emotionally hurt so long that it physically hurts in your chest?. I have alot going on in my mind, that it just starts to hurt alot in my chest. But i've got no one to talk to and no one's willing to listen.."
1,"One of the worst parts of depression is when people get tired of supporting you.. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, my family was very supportive at the start, I had a girlfriend who loved me and I wanted to make her my wife.

But the years have passed and my condition has not improved, people just start to get tired and see you as emotionally draining. This caused my girlfriend to leave me, my parents to get emotionally distant from me and my friends to disappear.

Now I am alone, miserable and suicidal. I have no one to talk to about this. My job sucks, my life sucks, and I see no way out of the miserable pit I live in.

Depression not only makes you hate yourself, it makes everyone else hate you as well. 
"
1,"Does anyone else feel shame in their depression because having it seems cliché and overused these days?. I'm so tired of hearing ""everyone's depressed"" and ""other people have it much worse than you."" Like I'm completely aware my life should be great and now I just feel bad for complaining?? Are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? I understand I'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because I can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  

*edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. I'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. I have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my ""support system"" blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. ""you just need to sleep more,"" or ""try to relax,"" or my personal favorite, ""have you tried meditating or yoga?"" HA. we've all been there. 

i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️"

1,"Does anyone feel like they are faking every single human interaction?. I'm a teacher and recently, have been told by management that I need to add more ""excitement"" to my classroom. Because of this, I've been trying to play a more comedic role, telling jokes, and so on. Today I realized that everyone I talk to... students, other teachers, or management, I wear this smiling face. Nobody sees my true colors. At the end of most days, I'm left feeling exhausted. I don't know if I can teach anymore. When I get home I just shut down, curl up in a ball and feel finally like ""myself."".


The only person who knows a little about my depression is my girlfriend. She knows I have ""bad days"" but doesn't realize it goes deeper than that.

I wonder if anyone can relate to this?

My marks are getting worse. Probably gonna lose my bursary. Medication is more but the depression isn't less. Am I cursed to feel like a outcast/weirdo/loser my whole life? Everyone keeps telling me just to get back up when life knocks you down. But I'm tired of fighting a losing fight. I just want to sleep."
1,"Does anyone else's mind like to randomly tell you that you should die?. Does anyone else have those thing where like you're totally okay, nothing is happening to trigger it at the moment, but then your brain is just like ""I want to die""? its really friggin annoying because like i tried to reply to it ""no i don't"" but then it replies back ""yes I do"" and it just repeats until it drives me insane. it's bad enough when I actually have something going on, but to have it on my few good moments/days is really depressing because its like I'm never free from it. If you have this, what do you do to get it to shut up?
Additionally, whenever I do something stupid/embarrassing/not perfect, my first thought is always ""kill yourself"" even if it's just like I cut some onions not evenly or I dropped something. its really disturbing and I'm so tired of it. how do you get this to stop?"
1,"Why do parents care more about school work than your mental state?. I’ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, I’ve been late on assignments. My parents know that I’ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and I’ve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue. It’s because I’m too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it. I️ can’t come up with anything to write because I’m too focused on how bad everything is. They never ask me how I’m doing, they ask me if I️ve gotten any homework done yet. And I️ just can’t take it anymore.

Edit: My parents do care about me, I️ know they do. They just don’t understand how serious its becoming. I know they’re trying to be supportive and understand what it is that I’m dealing with and why I️ haven’t been focusing or wanting to go to school but it’s hard to believe that sometimes when I️ just feel like they’re just trying to ignore everything that’s happening."

1,"Do you guys feel like every little task is exhausting?. So, I’ve had major depressive disorder for over half of my life. Do you guys ever feel as if every little task throughout the day is just exhausting, to the point where it feels like you need a break after accomplishing each one? For example, I know that I need to go grocery shopping, but even thinking about doing it is exhausting; so, I take a break after thinking about it. Then, I make a shopping list, which is exhausting; so, I take a break after making the list. And now, I’m faced with actually going to the store, which brings about a million other little exhausting tasks! For example, driving there, getting a cart, walking around, finding items, walking around some more, trying to control intrusive thoughts, walking around some more, then paying, then taking the shit to my truck, then driving back, then taking the shit out of my truck and into my apartment! Fuck! So many fucking things! I’m exhausted just thinking about it.

1,"has anyone else been depressed since they were children?. i don't know if it's even possible for children to have depression-- everytime i've told a psych professional they've laughed at me. the thing is, though, i've literally always been depressed. like, i hear people talk about how times were easier when they were younger and how they could go back to that time of innocence and all, but i never had that. maybe, *maybe* in my first few years i was moderately happy, but from then on i've always been depressed. i just grew up too fast.

does anyone else understand what i mean?"

1,"It's done. Pills taken.. You know, I went down my list of contacts, seeing whether there is anyone I would have liked to say goodbye to or say anything too really. Nobody. Not a single person. I told my wife I love her and she will be fine. Both are true.

Edit/update : I don't really know what to say, I honestly didn't think my post would be seen by anyone at all. I feel like now I owe everyone an update.

I did take the pills. I ended up taking a cocktail of about 70 pills of varying drugs. I was planning on taking twice as many, but my wife walked in and saw me (I thought the room was securely locked) and freaked out and took all the rest. I was too out of it to even challenge her the benzos were kicking in hard, and she called the emergency line. Ambulance picked me up, dropped me off at the hospital, and I was told I wouldn't be seen for 5 hours (UK hospital). The idea of having to wait that long just to be seen just reinforced my feelings of being totally rejected and low priority in society. I left. I got more pills and took them. I told my wife, and she wouldn't stop calling me and calling the police. She wouldn't stop calling and it drained my phone. Literally the only thing I felt like doing was listening to my favourite songs as I passed. That's all I wanted. The closest place I could think to go was the hospital cafeteria, which was still relatively close, and I had a charger with me since I was expecting to spend some time in the ER anyway. The sockets in the cafe were all disabled, but thankfully the socket in the hospital chapel was not. I spent about half an hour there charging my phone, and my wife had phoned half the city by that time, including my university support. As soon as I turned on the phone, I got a call from a private number that turned out to be the hospital asking where I was since they were ready for me. I admitted I was in the chapel, and that's where they found me huddled up in a corner, a nurse and 3 security guards saying they were there to help me. That was 7 hours ago, I'm still here and the hospital staff have treated me terribly ever since. I know that this sounds like it's supposed to have some kind of happy ending to it, but quite frankly this entire experience has just been dehumanising and has made me realise that there should not be any more half-measures. I'm not happy I'm still here. I'm a hostage and they're forcing me to stay against my will ""for my own safety"". I've been through the ER routine more often than I can count, but this time has been more nightmarish than I could have possibly imagined. One way or another, I will never be going back to the ER again.

On a more positive note, I cannot begin to thank or repay the many kind words I've received. My inbox is practically full, and in some ways so is my heart. It makes me feel guilty that I still feel awful, but I do. Your words are so kind and sweet, but I'm still really struggling here. Thank you all so much."
1,"Dear mods: Can you please do something about the influx of tough love zealots on this subreddit? It's a clear violation of the rules on the sidebar for anyone to advocate tough love bullshit. We need you to crack down on this. People are getting insulted, emotionally abused and put down daily.. The tough love ideologues are really getting out of control. I don't know where they are coming from. They are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. Many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. 

We really need the mods to crack down on this. I also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. I understand that you say that on the sidebar. But I request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. 

There are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.

I strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.

I think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their Dr Phil reruns."
1,"im so lonely, but i no longer have any energy to maintain a relationship.. im a burden, im toxic, i hate myself. 


loneliness began eating me whole when i realized no one is actually ever there for me. my friends has stopped trying to understand me.

it just sucks bcs before i fully sunk into this hole, i was trying very hard to be cheerful. i always went out of my way to make others happy or to try at least understand them. i always, always sacrifice my time, and love--something i couldn't give myself i gave to others. but its so sad when i realized everyone was so much happier when i wasn't included.

one time i just saw my friends having fun together and i stopped in my tracks to go to them. i stared from afar how joyous they were without my presence, therefore i maintained it that way. i kept avoiding them, i just didn't have anymore energy to hold a basic conversation. i cant even finish tasks anymore. im still friends, we still talk, but they know how i feel now ans they don't understand me. they thought i was just having mood swings. how i wish that was the case. 

cleaning the house takes me weeks to finish and i cant even do my homeworks anymore. im failing class and im failing life.


Tl;dr?

""It doesn't matter what I do or what I choose I'm what's wrong. There's nothing I can do about it. If I'm not hurting myself, I'm hurting everyone around me. There's nothing I can do about it. I'm... I'm broken.""

1,"The shittiest feeling is looking back on your day, and knowing full well you could've done a lot, but you didn't.. I could've done so much today. I could've finished work I should've been done with days ago and studied. But instead I did absolutely nothing. There were a few times where I tried to start my work, but instead just heavily procrastinated and browsed Reddit and YouTube all day...and look where I am now. I wasted the whole damn day! I'm on the brink of crying.

And you know those occasional days that feel longer than usual days, where an hour feels like two, maybe three hours? It was one of those days. And the feeling like I had more time than usual today makes this feel so much worse."

1,"The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering. *Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.


The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about ""caring."" If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, ""Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff."" 

Obligatory Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! It's my first!"

Edit: WOW this post blew up. Can’t say I had the best birthday, but I very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one, and it definitely made me feel better! Common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays, it is important to monitor your expectations, put yourself out there and be vulnerable, and know that it is common to feel this way, so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to. Even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself. Best wishes and thanks again for your support!"

1,"Does anyone get triggered by being yelled at?. All of my life, getting yelled at has absolutely been the trigger to bring me to such a low. It’s the feeling that I did wrong, and that I’m useless and a fuck up that slowly grows darkness over me. 

I am not diagnosed with depression but I have bad anxiety and I know that they can go hand in hand to completely screw your life over. 

Often, my moods fluctuate. I can have very high highs, where everything is good and I’m feeling beyond great, then with a simple trigger I can sink into this deep sadness where I go numb and have no interest in doing anything. 

I’m supposed to get a haircut today but I can’t seem to get out of bed. This feeling is scary and I hope for the best for anyone who deals with this. 

You are all loved!

1,"Rick and Morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts I've ever seen on television. So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a ""cry for help"" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. 

Rick Sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it."
1,"I don’t want to kill myself but if I died right now, I wouldn’t mind.. I hate my life. I’m stuck home with my depressed parents who make me feel guilty if I try to have a social life as though i should be at home moping around with them instead. It’s gotten to a point I feel selfish for wanting to go out with friends and if I do, I’m miserable. But I love being around people. I love talking and doing things with others but I can’t anymore. I don’t have anyone. "
1,"Do you ever feel like you have everything that's needed to be happy yet you are miserable anyways?. I just wanna now if I'm not alone...

Edit 1: I really appreciate all your replies, I read them all and will keep reading.

I can safely say feeling disconnected from everything is what makes us the most damage, despite having all of our basic needs satisfied. I guess we all have to learn how to survive with this instead of fighting it, and sharing our thoughts here helps with that a lot.

Regards to everyone and thanks again."
1,Depression is when 'cheer up' is the most annoying thing to hear.. It sucks when people tell you to cheer up when you fucking can't.
1,"Does anyone else here feel like before depression and anxiety they had so much potential and we're meant to do something great. Before all the pain, suffering and hell?

Did you guys have potential? What did you want to do "
1,Does your chest ever hurt from loneliness?. anyone else ever feel like this or is it just me?
1,"Anyone else here feel dazed, zombie-fied and emotionless?. I mean, I feel like some kind of zombie robot just going through the motions of life but never truly engaged in it.

Everything I do is just on auto-pilot and it seems like a huge effort just to do anything...like even feeding myself or making a simple cup of coffee.

I just walk around half-dazed all day doing what little I can do with no real motivation or pleasure behind it. I just live in a fog. It's almost like my brain has stopped producing any of the chemicals associated with reward, pleasure, motivation, etc and I'm merely existing."
1,"I just wanted to let anyone who read my last post know that I've taken a shower two days in a row and actually went and got my hair done.. I know to most it seems so simple a thing to do, but there are periods of time where I couldn't muster the energy to shower regularly.  Also I didn't comb my hair for weeks and months at a time.  They cut off all that tangled mess and dyed it darker.  I feel better now, hopefully I can stay on track."
1,"My dad spilled boiling hot tea all over my lap. Serious second degree burns.. I love my dad but he gets super mad when I don’t do as he asks, I was drinking some green tea when I was arguing with him , he hit  the cup I was holding and suddenly the worse pain ever was all over my thighs and stomach. 

It’s been 3 days since then, the doctors said it’s really bad but might not scar. I’m in so much pain guys I honestly wish he just killed me that night instead. I had to clean my wounds and it was so horrifying seeing your own raw flesh it’s just not meant to be seen man. 

Worse day of my life. I’m not able to move out of bed at all currently. I’m feeling like shit atm. I just want to say that I hope you guys are getting through life better than I am. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel safe in my own house ever again. I’ve had sleep paralysis every night since of the incident. Look all I’m saying is I really hope you guys are having a better day than I am, please make sure your eating well and taking as much care of yourselves as you can!

EDIT: Okay so this got way more attention then I wanted, but thank you so much for everyone with their well wishes and support. I was overwhelmed when I woke up to this, I truly was, and I was scared in a way to address all of this. 

Firstly, If you guys want to see my wounds as you guys don't seem to be believing me, I will post a picture of the bandages, or if you guys want to see my actual wounds, I am willing, as I am getting the bandages changed at the hospital today. This post, more than anything, has made me realize that this sub is sacred to people that are going through bad things. I would never post a fake story and take up anyone's time. I understand why you guys would be suspicious, and I am willing to do whatever to prove myself. The reason I posted this was because I felt like shit and alone, and I needed to justify the pain I was going through, so I wanted to kindly ask people to be grateful for what they have, as it can always be worse, myself in this very moment included. Instead, almost a thousand people have heard me, and have supported me. Funny thing is, I've actually missed some resits for uni because of this and I might have to retake a year, and this thread has made it feel much less worse.

Secondly, my Father. Hes a good man, but this is the last time, he has promised to me. I belive him. I think the world of my parents, but things won't ever be the same between us. This is the last time, I love him, but this is too much. 

Thank you all for your support, it means everything to me.I honestly had no one at that moment, but I feel so loved, thank you all."
1,"For me, Depression isn’t overwhelming sadness; it painfully boring. Apathy, lethargy, dysphoria, melancholy... they all just make life so dull. 
Sometimes I think I experience it differently from a lot of people, but I also know it’s a fairly common feeling. 
I’m not really seeking advice, just venting and probably seeking some validation.

Edit: Apparently I failed to spell check the title... I blame the apathy "
1,"No one cares if you're sad. one of the things you learn with depression

your life isn't a tragedy to friends and fam, it's a black comedy. you don't get love and support by publicly suffering all the time. only by being great and happy all the time and having a bad day that one time. then they care.

i dunno im drunk, ignore me."
1,"I have work in 50 minutes. I don’t want to get up from bed.. I feel physically unable to leave the bed today, and I don’t even care if I get fired.

I just don’t want to today. Maybe tomorrow. Fuck me."
1,"""Suicide is selfish"". No, fuck you. The thing that's selfish is that you expect people to stick around just to keep YOU happy. 
Why do people have such a problem with suicide? If I wanna end it I'll end it. I want out of this cruel world."
1,"Does anyone feel like depression stops them from being the person they were born to be, but then feels guilt and anxiety about trying to become that person.. I swear depression is one paradox. You start on level one, depression goes to level two, you go to two and depression goes to three. In the meantime you tell your self a bunch of bullshit to act like depression isn't taking over and ruining your life but it is. No one understands how awful it is, depression is a life stealing shitshow

There is not rock bottom, it always gets worse. Whenever you think your at the lowest, it goes lower. 

Growing into or enjoying yourself is impossible

Depression has made me a walking idiot 

Your 2% of your former self 

It makes me want to cry ):"
1,"Does anyone else feel like they can no longer feel their own emotions, but instead have just learned to mimic those of the people around them in order to seem ""normal?"". I seriously do not remember the last time I felt an emotion that was my own, beyond the alternating crushing ennui and bone-deep sadness that is the depression. 

Any ""normal"" emotions; Happiness, laughter, excitement, even just normal neutrality, all of those are foreign to me. I only ""feel"" them when I'm near someone else who is feeling them, and that's only because I've learned to mimic the behaviors associated with each emotion while in a social setting so nobody will ask what's wrong with me. 

Is this a thing other people do? Or am I just really fucked up?"
1,"Does anyone else want to just sleep for a long, long time?. I wish I could hibernate. I don't want to die, I just want to go to bed for a couple months and come back to the world when I feel ready. "
1,"Does anyone else feel like they constantly need fresh starts?. It doesn't matter how hard I try, I just fuck up every relationship and friendship i'm in with everyone. I keep wanting fresh starts then it keeps crashing down."
1,"Where does my mental illness stop and my personality begin?. I hate my depression, but at the same time I am terrified of losing it. What would be left? My current life is the result of years of untreated depression and apathy, and that is what I have always been."
1,"No social skills, no romance, no love. No hope for the future.. I'm a 33 year old male and I've been struggling with depression for the past 15 years of my life. It keeps getting worse one day at a time. I've always had severe social anxiety and did what I could to avoid talking to people. I tried dating a few times in my life but the relationship wouldn't last more than a few weeks. I would be extremely nervous and wouldn't know what to say but I would tell myself that every other guy on the planet can do this so I can too. It finally dawned on me that I have no social skills and can't hold conversation to save my life. You might think I'm over exaggerating but you'd be wrong. I really can't think of anything to say. Even if you were to give me a list of things to say I'm not intelligent or quick witted enough to hold a 5 min conversation let alone hours upon hours of talking to someone I'm interested in. It's like my mind is a blank slate the never got programed. I tried therapy and meds but I finally realized it's hopeless. There is something severely wrong with my brain. I hate myself so much and I would do anything to be a normal guy with a normal love/sex life. I have a bunch of other problems that make me depressed but I've already written enough here. If you actually read all this, thanks for listening to me vent."
1,"I hate sleeping because it makes tomorrow come sooner.. I've noticed that a big symptom of depression that a lot of people have is excessive sleeping and depressed people often view sleeping as an escape. But for me, the thing I always dread most is tomorrow. I hate getting up and having to face the day, regardless of whether I slept. And sleeping makes it come so much faster. I don't know. Does anyone else feel like this? Or am I just weird"
1,"Anyone else love sleeping and are sad when they wake?. I'm happy when I've been sleeping. No worries or cares from this life to bother me. Then, I wake up and am sad. Sad because I'm still alive. Sad because I'm still the same me. All of the other issues in my life that make me depressed come back to mind and the joy that sleep brought slips away so quickly. "
1,"I turned 65 today, and nobody cared. No calls, no cards, no emails - nothing. It's a big birthday. I always thought I'd be surrounded by my loved ones on my 65th birthday, but not one of them ever calls or writes or sends even a Christmas card to me. One day I'm going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they haven't seen me for awhile. Then they will all act so sad. 

I remember at my father's funeral, some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. I looked at him and said ""Who are you?"" and then I asked him ""If he was such a good friend, why don't I know you? I'm his daughter and I've never seen you in my life.""

When I die, nobody will come to my funeral. Nobody will give a rat's ass that I am dead. That's why I'm donating my body to science.

UPDATE: Just want to thank everyone who posted well wishes or shared their life stories. I wish I had more time to answer all the replies. It really did lift my spirits, though, so you did what you intended to do. This is one reason I love Reddit and why I love young people. They really have such good hearts, but I think maybe they don't want to face their own mortality quite yet, so they tend to turn away from older folks like me. I was the same way when I was younger.

Anyway, thanks again! "
1,"Bye. I gave myself a year. My birthday is tomorrow. There’s nothing worth living for, nobody loves me, the only reason anybody ever cared about me is that they had something to gain. When I’m gone they’ll forget about me in a little bit."

1,"Ever realized that after you patted everyone's backs, no patted yours?. You helped everyone, gave em a smile! Asked if they were okay! But then you realize that not a single one asked you back? Friend or Family?

1,Anyone else so fuckin tired all the time?. After school i don’t feel like doing anything. I just wanna lay in my bed and sleep or watch Netflix
1,"I'm 24. My father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. In the span of 4 months.. I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 

And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 

EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 

For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today. "
1,Why give me fucken mental illnesses and an ugly face and body? You couldn’t just give me one? Fuck you.. Sorry for the little rant. I’m poor and ugly. Don’t hurt me.
1,"Does anyone else feel like crying sometimes but physically can’t. I want to cry so badly sometimes but my body just won’t let me

1,Doing nothing is boring but doing something is so hard. I'm so bored of just sitting in my room for the whole day watching YouTube videos or lying in bed til it's nighttime and I can go to sleep again. But whenever I have something I need to do or when I was employed and working everyday it was so fucking difficult and I just wanted to die. 
1,Do you ever stop and think “what the fuck am I doing”. Then go right back to the empty feeling of nothing where you keep wasting life. Seconds of snapping out of it then back to bring controlled by depression.  I hate that split second I open my eyes when I wake up 
1,the only reason i am still living is because i want to play more video games and watch more TV. I literally live in order to escape from living. this is a wretched fucking existence and i want to end it.
1,"Do you ever try and make someone feel better when they're dealing with problems and be all supportive on this sub then post about your problems that are usually quite similar?. I feel like I was about to do this and talk about how purposeless and lonely I am, After telling someone else they aren't alone and there are always people to help.

Edit: oh my god [wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H46FRRvb-9o) ! This is the most upvotes I'll probably ever get I'm glad you guys know what I means <3 thank you"
1,Tonight's my final night. I sold my PC and drum kit for a handgun a couple days ago and I'm planning on using it tonight. I'm going for a long drive into a secluded area and ending it here. Life is simple in the moonlight bye Reddit.
1,"I think I'm destined to be disliked.. It doesn't matter where I am. School, college, home, online. There's something about me that makes people despise me and treat me like the most repulsive thing ever. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm too awkward, quiet, ugly. Most likely a combo of all three. The few relationships I managed to form turned to nothing, and now I've spent years with nothing but loneliness. Now I'm trying to convince the successful people in the world to hire a waste of space. Part of me doesn't even want to try, in fear that anyone forced to be around me will immediately dislike me. I just really want to end it, I hope I get the courage soon."
1,"Does anyone else constantly joke about killing themselves?. Has anyone ever asked if you’re ok?

1,"The one aspect of depression that people don't talk about enough.... is how bloody incompetent it makes you. I'm stuck waiting outside my therapist's office for an hour, because I can't hold a time in my mind for literally the two minutes it takes to go from phone call to note app.

I'm so much worse at literally everything."
1,"I drew my depression.. Today during class, I drew what depression is like for me. It sounds weird, but it made me feel better for a while. Anyways, here it is.

1,"Whenever someone compliments me, I immediately becomes suspicious of their intent. 3am again stuck in my own thoughts again.
It seems I hold such a low opinion of myself, that I just can’t accept a compliment for what it is but rather find a reason to deflect it. Do any of you feel this way? "
1,"Do you ever feel that when you're in your depression you see the world more clearly than other people?. I'm grateful for the times I'm *not* depressed and can function fairly normally, but I've noticed that when I'm in the midst of a depressive episode my thoughts about the world seem to be a lot more accurate (and bleak).  And then I wonder if it's better to be depressed and honest about life, or to be in la-la land."
1,"Does anyone else feel like they're a burden on their parents?. They spent so much time, money and effort for me to turn out like this. I wish i had to energy to work or go to school so i don't feel like i wasted their money to be a lazy fat ass who sleeps all day and eats their food. I don't have the energy to leave bed most days I don't even know how i can find a job or think of a career to study."
1,"Does anyone else spend most of their time laying in bed?. I don’t know how it got this bad. I’ve always struggled but this is on another level. I’ve spent almost the last 3 years in bed every single day and night. Luckily I work from home, but I do that in bed as well. I realize it’s not healthy I just have no motivation. People have made jokes that there will be an indent in my bed from me never leaving it which is so embarassing. I don’t want to be like this anymore but i’m terrified of trying meds. I took them in high school and they made me almost manic. I said and did a lot of stupid things on them. I just want to feel normal again 😞. "
1,"Math teacher made my day. Today I was feeling shitty from the moment I woke up.

Nothing was going right. First I got yelled at by my mom, then I fucked up an important exam.
 
I basically have a self-harm kit in my bag (razor in my phone case, gauzes and bandaids...) and I was really planning to just go and cut in the school bathrooms.

But then math period came. I usually don't do anything in math and fuck up most of my exams there. But lately I've tried to understand what we were doing there. 
And today, the teacher told me to go solve a problem on the whiteboard.
And after I solved it, my teacher said:

 ""See? You're really good at this!""

I almost fucking cried right there. I didn't actually feel like a worthless piece of shit for once. And you bet I didn't touch that razor today.

Some people dont know what even the smallest compliment can do to a person. So yeah, shoutout to my math teacher, she really made my day with this.
"
1,Why can’t i fucking DO anything?. I have no interest in anything anymore. It just sucks. I sit around all day motionless occasionally maybe listening to two seconds of music but then turning it off after being unable to concentrate. I hate this.

1,"Anyone else almost non-functional when they have freetime?. I recently got a 40 hour a week job, its been great, I wake up, go to work, go to sleep, repeat. When I am there I listen to music or a podcast and then I go home. Once I get home, on the weekends, I am almost non-functional. I want to die so bad right now and the voices are once again coming back full force, beating me down to the point where I can't focus on anything, I just want to cry and sit in bed, or stab myself repeatedly with a knife. Instead I sit in front of a computer and game for as long as I can. Most of the time I am completely alone with my own thoughts on the weekend. 

Even now my mind is yelling at me. I dread the weekends. "
1,Congrats to me.... I brushed my hair for the first time in a week.
1,"I fear that I use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities.. Hello everyone. First off, as I'm sure is the case for most of you, this post was extremely hard to write. I don't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody. I am in a pretty good situation overall, with a good family, great girlfriend, great friends, and a nice apartment. Yet, despite all that, I feel so incredibly shitty most of the time. It makes me feel guilty - why should I feel like crap when I have it so much better than probably 99% of the world? Yeah, everyone gets stressed by work, traffic, money, etc but it's called life. 

These are thoughts I have all the time which is why I don't like to talk about my feelings much. I see a therapist and I don't really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me. But I absolutely hate talking about it otherwise. The thought of making my problems other people's problems is horrible to me. 

Another thought that I have is do I just use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? Like am I just not mature enough to deal with real life so I can just say to myself ""hey I'm depressed so it's okay that I don't give maximum effort?"" I am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating.  I often just think I'm incredibly lazy and that I use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed. Has anyone had these thoughts before (and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit - I'm brand new here). I just don't feel like I'm cut out to deal with the real word. I don't have whatever ""it"" is to be successful professionally - between social anxiety, inability to concentrate, and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know this is a giant ramble. Glad to have somewhere I can just write down all my incoherent thoughts"
1,"One day, that quiet kid will commit suicide. One day, that quiet kid will commit suicide, and come his funeral, his parents and siblings will be crying. But none of his classmates will say a word because they never spoke to him. They will remember the times their eyes moved past him as if he were part of the wallpaper. How many times they forgot he was in the room. Isn't it tragic that the only time they remembered he was with them at all was the day he left the world? 

Good luck to you, fellows, who are like me. Depressed and lonely, and waiting for the end of it to come."
1,"While others are out making memories they will cherish forever, I am rotting away in my room alone. I wish I could rewind at times and fix this mess.

1,"does anyone else feel like they’re in a trance, of sorts? as if they’re just floating through life - which feels intangible in itself - with very little or no purpose?. that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine, human person.

my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it’s inhabitants - that it’s all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn’t help this feeling. it’s not a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. just a constant state of being “out of it”.

i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)

edit: wow i forget how awful of a typist i am. i must learn to proofread for the amount of typos i make haha

edit ii: i’m surprised this post has gained so much recognition in such a short space of time. although it’s sad that a lot of us seem to be struggling with this, at least we’re not alone (ew, cheesiness)

edit iii: some people seem to think i’m a guy in the comments, which is fine (i don’t mind!), but i wonder why because i’m a girl haha. thank you again for all the upvotes and comments on this."

I feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy! Even though I know that tomorrow morning I might disappoint myself, I won today's battle. Try to remember that every proactive thing you do (no matter how small, like making coffee) is a huge personal success! 

(to clear things up, I have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower/energy which results in longer, depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be)

EDIT: so happy to see that my post has inspired others and thank you ALL for the congratulations and encouraging words :) this subreddit is truly a wonderful and supportive community"
1,"Anyone else feel like you have to be physically ill to make people realize you’re mentally ill?. I have depression since childhood and nothing has ever been done until I cut my wrist once. 

I hate selfharming. I never had an urge to do it, but it did feel like something you had to do to ‘prove’ you’re depressed, especially when you’re a teenager. If not, you’re seen as someone who’s just sensitive and complains a lot. Other illnesses like anorexia also seem ‘necessary’ to have to make people finally realize that you’re mentally unwell. 

Even my own parents saw my suicidal thoughts as an afterthought at first. When I confessed to my teachers about my selfharming, they finally tried to find a therapist for me. "
1,"My dog just died. I walked in home from work, and after spending a couple minutes looking around for my baby when she didn't meet me at the door I found her curled up in my blanket at my desk where we sit, mangled by one of my other dogs. She was laying cold and stiff in the same spot and in the same blanket where we would chill out together. I'm completely lost right now"
1,Today is my birthday. The first recognition of that was by Google at 1:30pm.. January was incredibly difficult. February is proving almost as bad. I don't know if I'll make it to see spring.
1,"""Sorry I didn't reply, I was taking a nap"". Is really just code for ""sorry I didn't reply, I didn't have the energy to talk to anyone or engage in any sort of human contact so I laid in bed for 4+ hours, in the middle of the day, listening to music and thinking about how horrible everything is.""

Me right now."
1,"Anybody else just used to being depressed and accept that's how it is?. I've reached that point in my life, where NOT feeling depressed feels weird to me.  I'm just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh, that to actually think of life without depression just makes me roll my eyes.  Like that will ever be possible.  I can never just be happy.  There always seems to be some sort of catch.  Happiness seems to come at a price.

I've also noticed that after feeling happy, that I just *crash* hard back into depression and I feel worse than before.  I sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug.  The high is amazing and uplifting, but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness.  

I'm also anxious 95% of the time, even when I have no responsibilities or things to worry about.  I could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack.  I dunno, this might all just be me.  I just wanted to vent."

1,"Being African-American and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is. I just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, I am just speaking from my perspective.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

I just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that ACKNOWLEDGING MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A BAD THING!

UPDATE: I thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments. In the place of “African-American” I originally had “Person of Color” because I am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups. This was basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eyes to what other groups endure.
Stay strong everyone. No matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, your problems do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real. I am proud of you all ❤️"
1,"I am in shock.. Today at work my boss told me that she had a special job for me to do. She introduced me to a new hire (who is my age) and asked me to show her around. She was to hang out with me all night. Turns out we seemed to have a lot in common and we got along pretty well. We both left at the same time and when we walked out she asked me for my number. I'm just in total shock that anyone would like me enough to ask for my number, my awkward depressed self. Totally WEIRD"
1,"Do you ever start thinking about someone and then realise they aren't thinking about you?. I always catch myself thinking about someone and how much I like their company or attention, but then self-doubt creeps into my head and I realise that I don't even cross their minds. It makes me feel weird and lonely, I always start to feel real shitty. Anyone else?

Sorry if nobody gives a fuck or this is the wrong sub reddit, I just want to know if anyone else experiences this."
1,"Idk. The thing is, you don’t want to sleep,
but you don’t want to be awake.
You don’t want to eat.
but you don’t want to be hungry.
You don’t want to be around people,
 but you don’t want to be alone 
You don’t want to do anything,
but you don’t want to do nothing.

What you really want is to stop existing,
but you can’t do that without dying,
and you don’t really want to do that either."
1,"Wake up, neglect appearance and hygiene, play video games to escape life, watch anime in bed at night on my phone to escape the emptiness until I fall asleep. Repeat.. This has been my routine for a while now. Add in toilet breaks and eating food on the side. Sometimes I watch TV too and on days I'm feeling perky I brush my teeth and have a shower! Pushing the boat out right?

Living life on the very edge here. Or merely just killing time. I'll go with the latter. I don't feel very alive even gaming is more of a crutch to me than enjoyment."
1,"I've always had trouble articulating the severity of my depression, so I made some photographs that describe it instead. Thought you might enjoy.. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.

SO…I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!

1,"Does anyone else feel like that they've become a shell of their former self?. I feel like over the years, through a mix of some events that shook me, and secluding myself in my room, that i'm no longer the person I once was. I seem to have lost my personality completely, I don't act the way I used to. I rarely have anything to talk about and I can no longer make people laugh. I also feel myself becoming too cynical of recent, and i'm starting to think i've become unlikable.   


I have always been an awkward person, but as of recent I feel everything has just gotten so much worse."
1,"The only upside to having both anxiety and depression is that depression keeps me from doing things that will trigger the anxiety, and the anxiety keeps me from actively trying to kill myself.. I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 

While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 

So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   


Edit: Oh wow, you guys. I was not expecting all of this at all. I wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. I'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post. But thank you so much for the replies. I have read all of them, and will reply. I hope all of you have a great, great day. Let's keep our heads high! :)"
1,"Anyone else been depressed since childhood?. I don't see it being discussed much. It makes me feel rather isolated. I don't think I even remember joy. I only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. 

I've been depressed since I was 9. I suppose I was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. A lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. An inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. Most people my age (I'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but I only feel helpless. I am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like I can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. 

Depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. I have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. 

I'd be open to read your experiences and feelings! 

Edit: Wow, words cannot describe how relieved and elated I feel to know that I am not alone. All of you have dealt with such terrible experiences I wish no one had to go through. I wish all of you nothing but the best! I am exhausted on all planes of existence, but I will use what strength I have to carry on. We must all move on. "

I don't feel like myself, I feel I've been declining since February, depression or stress? but never been like this.. this has come on over the past 7\-10 days.. it's a leap from rough days to feeling mad, I don't know what this is and my google searches are not helping.. I need help.. and some peace of mind, has anyone gone through this? is this familiar to anyone, I've never heard anything like this before, like my mind has betrayed me.. or just, given up on me.

I'm so fucking confused and scared, is this just me? anyone else?"

I know getting votes and attention isn't everything but being very self-conscious about not being interesting sometimes I delete posts mid-writing even in this sub because I feel like a failure when no one replies. sorry this isn't meant as a call for attention either I just have no one to share these feelings with
1,"Yesterday, was my 14th birthday. Got absolutely nothing.. So yesterday was my 14th birthday, got up in a good mood looking forward to it just to find that none of my friends really did care, same for my family. My family mainly just ignored me that day. But on that day they bought my older brother, younger brother some stuff likes clothes and video games (rounded up to $500 all together). But even though it was my birthday they didn't get Me anything not a cake, not a hug, not even a simple ""Happy birthday"" or ""Love you"". Just ignored me. But not going to complain since it's been like this for years and I was abused in all ways as a child by them, I was also called the problem and interference between them.

Anyways whoever's read this have a good day. :)"

1,"I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked. So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. 

When she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.

So fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.

TL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.

Edit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things."
1,"Knowing that I can kill myself is the only thing that keeps me relaxed.. So, as in the title, One of the few things that makes me not fall in complete despair is knowing that I do have this way out. Just want to know if anyone knows what I'm talking about. Like, it came to a point where thinking about suicide actually comforts me enough to not do it. Am I a idiot for thinking this way?"
1,"I'm ""the funny guy"". I instinctively put on this act to make everyone laugh. Yet I really want someone to just see through my bullshit and understand how deeply sad I am.. When I'm around other people, I laugh boisterously and crack jokes like it's my fucking job. People think I'm this confident, hilarious guy who enjoys the fuck out of life. Of course, I can't blame them. I mean, I'm full of shit. That's the image I project. I can't help it. I just do it without thinking about it. But all I really want is for someone to understand the crippling melancholy that forms the foundation of all my jokes. I want someone to see through it all and just acknowledge how fucking hopelessly sad I am. The hilarious thing is that all it takes is a bit of honesty. Yet honesty feels completely unnatural to me. I can't be honest about my feelings. I just can't. I can face a wall and tell it about how miserable I am. But replace that wall with an actual human being, and suddenly it becomes impossible. I *pay* my therapist to listen to my true feelings, but as absurd as it is, I can't even bring myself to tell him just how dark my inner world has become.

I'm sad, Internet strangers. I'm really fucking sad. All the time. "
1,The only reason I haven’t tried to kill myself is because it would destroy my parents.. My mom is my best friend in the entire world and I couldn’t do that to her. I wish I could.
1,"Scared of helping people here.. I just want to say to everyone here that didn't get a response to their post, I'm sorry. I'm sure there are tons of us. Too scared, anxious to respond. From time to time I just go here and read people stories, their life and their problems. Most of us here have similiar problems and I'm 100% sure even though you may have not got a response you were hoping for, that there are people reading your stories, your problems and that they would want nothing more but for you to get better, even though they are too scared to respond."

I feel so lost, I thought it will only get better but it doesn’t. I lie to my therapist so she wouldn’t ask to see me more. I lie to my friends. I have no other family. I have never been close to my uncles and aunts. My parents were everything in me and my sister’s lives. I never imagined life would be this hard. I never thought there is a jungle out here. 
I need someone who felt/feels the same to tell me that It will get better. I don’t want to feel alone in this. "
1,Is there anyone here who is about to write a text post about their problems but then erases it because you feel like you're unnecessarily whining?. I do it many times. Posting this alone was a struggle. 
1,Do you ever feel ashamed to be in public?. Like you’re just so ugly and awkward and disgusting that you should never show your face again. Like you’re an embarrassment to the word human. And people are just getting second hand embarrassment just from knowing you’re in the room.
1,"Litter saved my life.. I was in my car this morning ready to kill myself (or at least trying I always chicken out). I went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so I wouldn't have to take anyone with me. That's when I drove by this massive LITTERING IS ILLEGAL sign and guess what? There's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! At this point I was beginning to somewhat calm down. I turned around and parked on the side of the road. I picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. Luckily I had a cheap duffel bag I wasn't using. Felt like I lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). After that I just got in my car and drove home. It's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.

1,"I wish I could give my life span to someone that was taken too early that deserved to live.. I just watched the Andy Whitfield documentary Be Here Now. He was the title role of Spartacus in the Starz series years back. The show was a hit and he was no doubt destined to do great things moving forward, but he was suddenly diagnosed with lymphoma cancer and died 18 months later. He left behind a beautiful wife and two children. He seemed to have been a decent and talented guy all alround and did not deserve to die.

I'm just a 27 year old pos working a crappy job and getting drunk every night. I'm short and ugly and will never find a women to start a family with. Why did a great guy like Andy have to die instead of me? Fuck cancer."
1,Does anyone feel like they’re not going anywhere in life?. I’ve felt like this for quite some time and can’t quite shake it off.
1,"Wife is dying and I feel so lonely.. I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

I've already lost so much and I don't know how I am going to cope when I'm here alone. I feel like I'll probably just see out my cats life and then take my own, nothing feels worth doing if I can't share it with her."
1,"That fucked up moment when you realize even suicide is not an option.. When you can't come up with an answer to ""what to do?"" question.

Fuck, I'm really feeling like shit. "
1,"Does anyone else excessively browse Reddit so they don't have to think about anything else?. I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?

I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.

**EDIT:** Wow, this post got so much more attention than I was expecting. I'm really glad to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. That being said, I think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from Reddit. To help me in this process, I'm going to be deleting this account, so I'll have less of an attachment here. I've read every one of your posts here. Thank you for sharing your experiences and opinions, and I wish you all the best in overcoming your struggles."
1,"My ex texted me ""I don't give a fuck even if you die"". So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said ""There's no such thing as depression""

Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""

I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.

EDIT: Just came home and saw your replies. I'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. In the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if I can help one person, I'd be the happiest person in this world."
1,"I don't see the point in being honest about my feelings with my family if all they will do is be angry at me for feeling the way I do. The title pretty much explains it. I don't understand the point of being honest with anyone if people give you dumb answers regarding the way you feel. Yeah they might actually care and that's their genuine answer, but perhaps I don't care about their dumb answer. I think I've become basically just numb. I don't want people to know how I feel because they just act angry towards me. What goes through people's minds. I could understand frustration because you feel unable to help me, but people act angry towards me. I don't want to ever talk with my dad regarding my mental state if all he does is be angry at me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support and compassion, I thought I was an idiot for feeling this way but lots of you guys experience the same! I wish you all the best and hope things get better for everybody <3"

1,"Have you ever been told by people that you're being ""emotionally manipulative"" for being depressed?. And then you suddenly second guess yourself, because you definitely dont wan't to be like that, but all of a sudden you think you are, and you struggle with the thought of it, overthink etc.

And it hurts more now and cant get out of your head."
1,"A letter to my daughter -from my depression. Dear Daughter, 

I hope you never have to really read this letter. I think it’s more for me than it is you. You’re only 3 right now and I know you can’t understand why Mommy cries..
Why mommy has a hard time just opening her eyes 
“Wake up mom” she says.
But Mom is in a dark place,
A hole where the sun can’t shine.
A nameless place
One where Mom doesn’t even want to see her own face.

You see today is a bad day 
And it hasn’t even started 
Mom is angry and Mom is sad 
And baby doesn’t know why,
“Am I really that bad?”

But you see sweetheart, it was never you. 
You see mommy has a condition that no one can physically see
But it hides inside her 

Like the deep, dark sea
Sometimes the waves ravage inside her 
And she just doesn’t want to go out in the world
She doesn’t even want a reminder 
Don’t tell me what time it is
Cuz some times she feels it would be easier to

Turn time off

But Gracie just wants to go play 
Mommy is too busy drying her eyes
“What’s wrong momma?”
But mommy doesn’t even really know.
The tears ebb and flow
While her heart just races

Mommy looks in her baby’s eyes 
And baby girl just knows she’s hurting
As Mom tries to disguise 
All that is going on, baby girl wonders...”what’s really wrong?”

Because Mom lives with depression and anxiety
There really is no disguising.
Most days she tried to put on a smile, reads a little positivity and tried to climb
The ladder
Out of the hole
Choose the latter 

I’m writing you this letter to show you mommy knows
I know how hard it must be to live with me
Because mommy lived with it too

I watched my mother 
Cry and sink and eventually even falll down the gutter 
To the dark places no one wishes to wander.

You see I never understood either. As a child I just wanted to be good for her, and never wanted to make her sad...just as I see in your eyes 

Please know mommy’s trying
And I would never contemplate dying
For that would mean life with out you
And darling
You are the sunshine to my dark moon"
1,"It's so hard to get out of bed.. I've spent 4 hours lying on the bed this afternoon. It's so hard to convince yourself because there's nothing to look forward to, nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self-care. It's easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self-hatred, sexuality, all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation. It's so hard when you have no emotional support, nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you, step-by-step. 

Nobody's listening.

I'm aware that I cannot and should not rely on other for validation, and I cannot seek their help all the time. I'm aware that only I can change things. But as soon as I'm trying to be independent, everything just falls apart immediately. 

Why am I like this? I just want the demons to go away. I don't need to be happy, I just want this to stop."
1,"My depression makes me want to be alone, and makes me lonely.. What the hell is this bullshit.

Edit: Thank you for the Gold. It's very kind."
1,"does anyone else get jealous?. i get jealous of other people’s abilities, talents, and achievements, since i have none. i also get terribly depressed when i hear stories of other people’s supportive families, their possessions. this makes me seem toxic and irritated out in public, when in fact i’m trying to cope with my worthlessness. i especially can’t stand people who have a tendency of humbly or subtly bragging. those people make me feel like absolute shit. 

does anyone else experience this... sense of loss? is it valid, or am i acting like an asshole? "
1,Who else is spending NYE alone?. I’m gonna be all by myself on NYE. I keep telling myself that NYE is overrated just to make myself feel better. But who am I kidding? I hope you guys have a good one and a happier one than mine!
1,"I forgot where I live. I have a brain tumor and the doctors told me my memory is going to get worse and worse. At first it was only little things, but today my friend was driving me home and I totally forgot where I lived. My road that I have lived on for my whole life seemed totally new. I had to think really hard to remember which house was mine. I've been crying for the past 4 hours over it."
1,"I wish suicide was easier. I tried to hang myself today but I was too scared. It's a painful way to die. I wish I wasn't scared of the pain. I want to die so badly. I wish I had a gun or poison. There are so many people on this planet anyway and death is just a part of life. I wish I could just buy a pill.

Edit: 
Thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate them. It's good to be reminded that I'm not alone and other people struggle with this too. 

To those telling me to see a therapist, I am in therapy and have been in therapy for 10 years . I am currently on medication, just increased my dosage about a month ago actually and have a doctor's appointment scheduled for next week. I've been in this battle for a long time, I've worked hard, I've tried many things and sometimes suicide feels like the only rational option."
1,Did you ever feel like your depression is fake?. Did any of you ever thought about you depression beeing fake and you just make it up to get attention? Or am i the only one feeling like that
1,"I won't commit suicide but I wouldn't mind dying. So much shit has been piling on and on. I feel like I am not making the people I care about proud and the only reason they talk to me is because of pity. I am scared of not being able to reach the expectations my parents have of me.

I will not take my own life, but if a car hit me, I got a terminal illness or if something fell on top of me. I would not be sad about me being gone."
1,"Anyone else feel like they're just living the same day over and over?. I feel like for as long as I have been depressed, I am  reliving the same day over and over again. Sometimes I just watch the clock change from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am and see the date change and think ""Yup, another day feeling the same way"". Time is moving forward and I am not. "
1,I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist. I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
1,Do you ever read/watch a really good story about friendship or love and then get sad because you realize its probably never going to happen to you?. Feel like all the best parts about life i can only dream about.
1,"Does Anyone With Depression Forget Their Memories?. I've noticed for a while that I'm forgetting things very easily. I can't remember the good memories I had with my friends whenever they bring up some past event. It's like my head is just erasing all of the memories I have, and it's making me more depressed than I already am. Does anyone else notice this too?

I thought maybe it has to be with depression, at least  it's my guess. Otherwise it could be just me."
1,"Does anyone have a completely normal day but still think of killing themselves?. Like i dont feel like i have any problems, but the thought of killing myself just doesnt go away."
1,"Does anyone hate not having anything to do, but at the same time, can't stay productive when there IS something to do?. My life is a mess right now. Everyone's ignoring me, and I can't stand being by myself. But at the same time, I want to be kept alone.

I don't know what I want to do, but even if I try something, I can't push myself to stay productive.

What am I even doing to push my life forward?!

Sometimes I feel so useless. Even I don't know what I want."
1,"News flash!!!. Hey people without depression who think I'll be cured by working out and eating better guess what!!! It doesn't cure it!! I run every other day and eat healthy with lots of vegetables, I journal, I do yoga, I go to individual and group therapy, I'm on medicine, hell I even have an essential oil diffuser to make my room smell nice. I make my bed and clean my room every day and stretch out morning and nights.

All neurotypical minds probably think I should be not depressed right now but guess what I still am!!! Doing all those healthy things makes my overall mood higher but it doesn't cure what's going on in my brain. I just want people to know that I'm trying hard and I still am not on neurotypical level like they want me to be. Thanks for coming to my TED talk"
1,"Life is too hard for me.. You have to take care of your body. Brush your teeth, shave, shower, get regular haircuts. Eat varied, healthy meals. Exercise regularly. You need a varied and fashionable wardrobe for social occasions.

You need money to support yourself and your lifestyle. You have to work or study for years to advance in anything that's not a dead end career. You have to deal with your boss, with your coworkers, with your clients. You have to deal with a thousand other people in a cutthroat environment who all want the same job or that promotion. You have to devote at least 40 hours a week to this, sometimes more.

You need to develop your identity and your personality. Find what interests you and pursue it. Have hobbies, read books, be an interesting person. You have to maintain a social life on top of all this. You have your family, your friends, your significant other. Birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgivings, Christmases. Mandatory social obligations. Gifts. Money. Endless conversation. Most of it is fake. There are so many unspoken rules and customs involved in social interaction and you're not allowed to show weakness. It's a constant, tiring charade and everybody knows it's an act but it goes on and on and on.

This is a fucking rat race. It's too much responsibility, too much chaos. I can't handle it all. How do people do it? I don't think I was meant to be human."
1,"Happy birthday, u/feelingdepressed, I told you I'd remember! :). In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:

Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you!

1,"Depression is humiliating. It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 

Have a heart. "
1,"Is anyone else always tired?. And I’m not talking about tired of life (Well not mostly.) I’m tired. All the time. No matter what I try to do, I can’t stop being tired. Exercise? Tired. Stay in bed all day? Tired. Try to socialize? Tired. Be alone? Tired. Eat or not? Doesn’t matter. Tired. Not matter how much or how little I sleep, I’m tired. I can’t find fun in anything anymore."
1,"Anyone else feel horrible about wasting their youth?. I'm 20 and I feel like absolute shit. This past year I've been doing nothing and I've been letting my illness ruin my life completely. I could have been doing something, anything, but I let it all go away.

I'm trying to make the most of my time now, but, it's hard, and I feel so bad... and I feel like I'm out of time and I can't have the experience I could've had. And most of all, I don't want to get older."
1,"Depression and social anxiety have turned me into such an uninteresting person.. The worst thing about these two things together is how boring I must be to other people. I'm either too afraid to do things with people and don't like myself enough to engage in social activities, or I'm so depressed that I don't have the energy for it. If I do try doing things, I feel like I'm faking some bullshit personality anyways. I would 100% change my personality if I could, but it just always gets too uncomfortable too handle. Being alone is comfortable and familiar."
1,"It came back. It always comes back.. I was doing so well. I was excited to be alive for the first time in many, many years. I thought I had finally begun a new, positive chapter in my life.  

Boy was I wrong.  

I'm sinking back into the depths of this insidious disease and losing my will to fight it. The older I get, the more I see suicide as an inevitability.  

I was not made for this world.  

I'm lonely. I'm lost. I'm afraid. And, above all else, I'm tired.  

What a cruel joke to be ripped from the womb and thrust into this absolute wasteland.  

Welcome to hell."
1,"Depression feels like you're drowning and no one wants to save you.. Most days I feel like i'm in the middle of the ocean, gasping for air as I bob up and down trying to scream for help. Yet yards away are a beach, a beach of my friends and family. They know the signs, they know what ""drowning"" looks like, yet they do nothing. Just stare. Just stare as I try to keep my head above water. 

No matter how hard I scream, no matter how much I wave my arms hoping for someone to notice and help me out. No one moves.

Its just me. Alone. In the middle of the ocean. Praying I can just keep my head above water for at least a day."
1,"For those of you who have been diagnosed with depression, did you ever feel like you DIDN'T want to feel/get better?. Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible."
1,"I raised my hand and spoke up in class.. After having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what I did today made me extremely happy. I hope I keep doing better.

Edit: thank you for all the support! I think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. I love this community."
1,"You know what kills me about being depressed, and how people view me/us? Please read this. Directed to all of you.. Is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people I have ever met/talked to. We all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. I feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. Whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. Problems are problems. People just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. Like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't ""Lighten up"". 

I really don't know any of you, but I already know that you are all some of the best people out there. I know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. In some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world. 

 Nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody."
1,"I think I’m suffering from depression. I hate throwing the word depression around. My mother has it and so I get very mad when people throw it around like it’s nothing. So I’ve refused to believe I’m depressed. I just tell myself that I’m just upset and I’ll get over it. But I’m not getting over it. Everything I used to love to do seems so boring to me. My video games have been unplugged for months, my books, my drawing supplies have been packed away. I’ve even started to loose interest in playing with my cat. I’m scared. I feel so alone and feel like I have no one to speak to. Anytime I attempt to talk to my parents they get distracted by my older brother, who needs much more attention than I do. I’ve been doing the same thing. I get home from school. Lay in bed and listen to music. I’m so unmotivated. I’ve even started to loose interest in eating and I’ve been starting to eat less. But when I’m around my friends I feel happy and myself for a little bit but it never lasts. I even wrote a suicide note today. I don’t plan on acting upon it but it just felt good to write about what has been happening. I just don’t know what to do. I’m only 16 and I’m so scared and feel so alone. Please."
1,"I've skipped work and laid in bed for 3 days straight. I don't know what to do. I just have no motivation to get up in the morning.. This is becoming a problem. This is not the first time this has happened either. I am surprised I have not been fired. I just can't get up. I am so unmotivated. Help! What can I do?

Edit: I am currently in therapy twice a week and taking antidepressants. I also have been working with my Dr. to get a healthier diet and exercise routine. All of these things have help a lot. But I still can't seem to get up and face the day. "
1,"I realised depression makes me only try to re-live old memories, and never new ones.. Every week I buy a packet of strawberry bon bon's from the same shop because I did that every week when I was 12 and I associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school, excited to spend the weekend playing video games.

I buy an energy drink every Wednesday because that was the night I used raid with my old WoW guild. Best times of my teenage years, and every Wednesday I had an energy drink alongside me. I'll probably do it tomorrow, too.

I stay up until 5AM regularly because I long to feel like I did when I was 14 and I remember staying up watching old movies I'd never seen before. I no longer get that sense of awe.

I used to eat pizza from the same place because I used to do it with my old band. The only place we ever went to and whenever I eat there I feel like I'm back in those days. 

Occasionally I walked the same route home that I did in High School so I can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl I fancied on MSN. That was a decade ago, though. MSN doesn't exist, she's moved on and I don't have anything to look forward to. 

The pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. I fucking cried because I felt like that part of my life was finally gone. 

I wondered if, in 10 years, I'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories I'm making now. I don't know if I will.

Depression has successfully taken away my ability to make new memories. Now my old ones are becoming harder to hold on to.

**Edit:** Hey everyone. I woke to an overwhelming response, thank you all for kind words, advice and for sharing your own tales of nostalgia. This is a hard subject for me, I look forward to the future but the past is special and I never want it to go away entirely. 

I'm not one for unique experiences, the memories I have were never holidays or the first time I kissed someone or when I left high-school, but rather a broad feeling because at some point there was a part of my life that was really good and even though doing it once was fun, doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head as a source of overwhelming positivity. Hopefully by making broader improvements to my life they'll start to form again.

I'll continue to read the comments for as long as this post remains relevant. Thank you, if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too, I'm right along with you."
1,"I’m ready to kill myself. But thank you all.. I’m basically done with living at this point in my life. I already wrote my note. I’ve basically planned out when and how I’m going to do it. Everytime anything good has come into my life my I ruin it with my depression and anxiety. I just don’t know how to be happy anymore or make others happy anymore. All I ever wanted was to be loved and I wasn’t good enough to get it from anyone when I needed it. It’s now been 8 years of me waking up everyday feeling tired, lonely, ugly and depressed. I just want to rest. I just want peace. The only way I’ll be able to achieve now is through killing myself. I’ve made a couple posts on here and I just wanted to thank you all. Everyone who’s commented or upvoted to show me I’m not alone in this world and I’m not abnormal or crazy. That’s meant more to me than most things my entire life. I truly and wholeheartedly hope you are all able to find pure, unadultered happiness and love in your lives, the emotions I couldn’t. This is probably my last post. Thank you all again so much for everything you’ve done for me and continue to try and live long happy lives, please.

Edit: Hey everyone, I’m still here. I had planned my day to be over a week away since I still have things I need to do before. I want to thank you all again for the kind words and messages. Reading these comments, the messages everything. It’s the first time I’ve cried happy and not sad tears since I was just a little kid. My mindset is still fairly firm unfortunately. I want each and every one of you to look at your own message and the messages of others and realize how full of love and life and kindness you all are. Given what this post is about this will be hypocritical but if you guys found out how to give the love you gave to me to yourself instead, this world would turn into a place I’d enjoy living in. I don’t know any of you, but I still love each of you for what you’ve done and said for me. Please try with all your hearts to live the long and happy life I won’t be. Never give up the faith that I have. Lastly, always be kind to everyone, including yourself. This Reddit will change and save lives because of all of you. Thank you again, and rest well."
1,"I can't kill myself because of my cat.. I realized that today. This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I don't want to cause any harm to this little thing and that's what keeps me alive. "

1,"I can’t “do” self care. I know that it’d help... but it’s so difficult for me to clean, cook, whatever. I get fearful of it, actually, find myself tearing up whenever I tell myself I have to clean, change the sheets, do laundry, etc. I know this is a common symptom of depression, blah blah, but my life is spiraling and I wish I could take some control by having a clean environment, but this fear / anxiety is overwhelming. :("
1,"Sleep is the best part of the day. I don't know if it's just me but the best bit is sleeping. It's not part of laziness, it's the fact that you don't get to live the world during that time

When you sleep you aren't comparing how miserable your life is to anyone else and nothing could matter at that minute"
1,"I couldn’t kill myself tonight.. 10 minutes ago, I sat down on my bed, I had my 9mm cocked. I held my gun next to my head but never actually pointed at my head.

I was scared. I couldn’t do it. I kept telling myself that it’ll all be over soon. Just point it my head, quick little pressing my of fingers and it be all over. I won’t feel it probably because it’ll happen too quickly for my brain to register the pain. Told myself that in just a split second, I won’t have to feel pain again.

I couldn’t do it. I felt like a fucking coward.

Edit: thanks for everyone’s kind words and support. It means a lot :)"
1,"31 and scared. No career, no friends and no girlfriend.. I haven't had a friend in almost 10 years. I used to have lots of friends and then everyone moved on with their lives.

I'm quiet and have social anxiety and it never really got better. I thought my life would change but it never did.

My parents are all I have.

I've never had a job where I earnt more than minimum wage. I have a degree. It didn't make any difference.

I joined a running group. I am always stood on my own and I feel very awkward and uncomfortable.

I am no different now than I was at 16. I am forever stuck in the summer after high school. I am scared that this is it and I will live like this for the rest of my life. I am genuinely terrified that if my parents go I will be completely alone. I want to cry but I am too despressed. I never made the life progressions that everyone else makes and I am in a daze wondering how and where it all went wrong. It feels like yesterday that I was in my teens."
1,Anyone else feel like your “friends” aren’t really your friends at all?. I feel like all my friends hate me. The people that truly know me resent me. I feel my presence isn’t enjoyed — just tolerated. I’m the clown of my group. I’m always the butt of their jokes. But yet they always want to hang out. Probably because I’m too nice. Probably because I have a car and everyone just uses me for a ride. I don’t know who’s really there for me and who’s just taking advantage of me. I’m better off alone. I don’t even know how to have a friend...
1,"3 years ago I nearly killed myself. 2 years ago I posted some drawings here. Now I have some more.. Hello everyone! About two years ago, on the anniversary of a near-suicide attempt, I posted an album here of different drawings I had made to cope over the year. The response was overwhelmingly positive and really encouraged me to continue pursuing my art. A lot of time has passed since then, and I’ve gotten a lot healthier as well as more skilled artistically, as it really helps me express myself in a positive way.

This project has taken me about 6 months to complete, and it’s been hard, but has really given me purpose and meaning. I cannot thank you all enough, for the role you have played in encouraging me to take this thing art thing more seriously. It has revolutionized my mental health.

So this project is something I've been working on for a while lately. It's called ""The Banality of Monsters,"" and it's ten ballpoint pen drawings, each with a corresponding text piece, telling a story about depression. Don't worry, I'm not selling this project or anything, I want it all to be free. I just want to draw. It gives me purpose. Thank you all so much for your support.

1,"I had my first kiss today. I know, Im really late on having my first kiss. Today I finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. For a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and I felt like someone actually cared about me. I just thought I would share this with you guys, because for me right now in my life, its about all I have.

Edit: Wow everyone, thanks for all the kind responses, I never thought this post would really get any feedback, and it now has 556 up votes on the front page. I really appreciate everyones support, and I hope each and every one of you has a wonderful day. Stay strong! - Colourgreen3"
1,"A year ago today I nearly killed myself. The next day I bought a sketchbook. Here is an album with drawings and doodles from a year's worth of recovering and coping.. Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 

Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. Please tell me if this is harmful and I will take it down immediately.

1,"Frustrated by the phrase ""happiness is a choice"". I don't subscribe to the idea that anyone who has truly suffered a depressive episode actually believes that happiness is a choice. The implication of that phrase is that victims are *choosing to suffer*. It's victim blaming at its very core. We can't choose our thoughts any more than we can choose the weather. Happiness is a not a switch that can be flipped at will, but every time I hear ""happiness is a choice"", I only start to think that something must be wrong with me because I can't find the switch. But of course I can't find the switch, because **there is no switch**. Negative thoughts are intrusive and undesired--they appear without our consent, and we have to actively fight them. That takes effort, and sometimes a *lot* of it.

The only thing I think we can choose is our actions; or rather, choose where we apply effort. That can take the form of just doing a little bit of work in our daily lives (making your bed, folding your clothes, cleaning your room, etc.), but in the end, we still only get to choose to apply effort *in spite* of unhappiness. We don't choose unhappiness.

I'm curious if anyone feels differently, though. What is your take on the phrase ""happiness is a choice""? Do you agree or disagree?"
1,"I’m really proud of myself! I’m back at work after 8 months off due to how bad my mental health has been.. I had a mental breakdown in January and my boss told me I either had to quit or keep working 50+ hour weeks. He could see I was in no state to be working. My family and friends also could see it. I quit and moved back home after my mother and friends were basically begging me to. They were all so worried and were afraid I would attempt suicide again. I’ve been seeing a psychologist once a week. Taking my meds every single day. Going to the shops and taking up hobbies so I can feel joy. All of it has been extremely emotionally draining but I have finally reached a much more stable place. So with the go ahead from my psychologist I started looking for part time work ( full time may be overwhelming so I’m easing back into it). I’ve been on a trial a few days last week at a cafe and really enjoyed it. Being around people and having a purpose feels so amazing. I got the job yesterday and start in a weeks time doing 28 hours a week. I am so proud of how far I have come due to all the hard work I’ve put in and all the amazing support from my family, friends and my partner. I am so proud of my self and genuinely excited to be working again. (I wanted to share because I am so happy and want people to know).

Edit: this got a lot more attention than I expected!! I am so grateful for all the supportive messages and all the people who I have given hope to. I wish everyone the best of luck and am extremely grateful for all of you ❤️"
1,Does anyone else wish they could simply sleep forever?. It seems only in my dreams does the feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness goes away.
1,"It's crazy how depression is treated like a joke.. It's crazy how tens of thousands of people kill themselves every year. People care so much about shit like coronavirus because it can actually kill them, but nobody cares about depression because they know that they don't have it or can't get it. Some people are just permanently in complete despair at all times for years at a time and nobody cares or helps them because severely depressed people usually don't have many friends or loved ones anyways and then they get called selfish when they finally end their own lives. People don't think much of it because it just sounds like sadness which everyone experiences, but people don't understand what it's like to constantly hate every second of every day and hate everything about yourself. And everyone will just tell you bullshit like ""it gets better"" which it doesn't by the way, it gets worse and worse with every single day and nobody cares. I don't know why I'm typing this, I just sat in my room for like 17 hours and idk."
1,"Does anybody else just feel like only laying in a couch/bed and just watch YouTube?. I often just only sit or lay in my bed using my phone to watch videos or maybe play a game, since i have nothing better to do. I don't feel like doing any homework at all. Sometimes i might get my ass up and use my computer. Does anybody else experience something similar to this?"
1,"Whatever you do, please don't ignore me.. You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it. But whatever you do, I'm begging you, *please* don't act like I'm not there at all."
1,"people mistaking your lack of motivation for laziness. i feel stuck in my current situation, even thinking about it stresses me out. when i explain it to people, they say it sounds like excuses, me being lazy, me feeling entitled... every day i want to go out and do something about it. i don’t want to feel like a leech on society and absolutely hate feeling that way, but i just feel like i’m damaged beyond repair. i barely interact with people. i barely leave my apartment. i feel like i’m incapable of functioning properly in society, no matter how good my facade of being a “normal person” is."
1,"I want to kill myself but can't because I need to play Fallout 4.. You might think this is a joke. It isn't. I've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. The only thing that alleviated my depression when I was younger was Fallout 3. It was the best game I'd ever played. I swore to myself when I got bored of FO3 (two years after it came out) that I wouldn't kill myself until Fallout 4 was released. I didn't count New Vegas, because, well, it sucked. Now that 4 is coming out, I don't know what to do with myself. I still want to die, but I can't just keep pushing it off until the next Fallout release. I'm addicted to the series, yes, but I'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. I feel so pathetic. I've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. What else is there to live for? People generally bore or upset me. I have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything I could really ask for. I'm not allowed to get medication as I'm still under my parents insurance. I'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  I'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. 

I hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. Just writing this has helped, to some degree. 

Thanks.

Edit: Fallout was released last night at midnight. I'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... I'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. Its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. Thanks all."
1,"My depression and anxiety keeps me from saying anything. People don’t understand, sometimes I want to say stuff about how I’m feeling or talk about my depression or anxiety, but I just don’t. I just think if I tell my friends or anyone anything they won’t understand and think I just want attention. Sometimes I literally type whole posts on here and don’t post them because I feel like people won’t care. I don’t know why I do this to myself but I can’t help it. I just hate myself for doing this to myself."
1,"I hate when my boyfriend says, ""But don't I make you happy?"" That's not how depression works, love :(. Then I have to be the big bitch, instead I just ignore it, which could possibly be worse. I don't know how to explain it, but no, you don't make me happy because I'm too depressed."
1,"Does anyone else retreat into their own self made fantasy's?. Lately I have to keep my mind occupied on something, or else I feel like breaking down, like a damn that's about to burst. I keep fantasizing about a fictional version of me that isn't so broken. Someone who has made something of themselves. I've been watching hours of youtube and inserting my self into those videos and it's just making me more depressed. Someone who is normal and does normal people things. I feel like someone on the outside looking in. I still find it easier to just day dream than feel anything ""real"" in my actual life. Else I just feeling like killing my self. "
1,Anyone else get annoyed by relatives who think that finding religion will help your depression?. I’m not sure how to go into any more detail than what the title says but it seems that religious folks and most not only born agains believe that finding Jesus will make every single life problem go away. It doesn’t and yet they still keep insisting that it will.
1,"It’s 3am. This again. I have to be up in 3 hours. I can never sleep because my mind never stops racing and it’s awful. All the reasons to hate this life, all the reasons to hate myself, all the things I could do to myself. Funny how little does everyone know that I hate myself more than anyone could imagine, I constantly wish I could hurt myself as punishment for being the sore loser that I am, and wish I could be dead because I feel so worthless in this world that it would be easier than trying to fit in.

I hate depression."
1,"Depression has turned me into a mean person.. This past year has been so scary because I’m noticing that my sadness and lethargy is turning into uncontrollable rage. Everything sets me off and I lash out at people who are only trying to help me. Ex: Yesterday I was cooking, and my mom asked me if I washed the vegetables. Instead of replying like normal and saying “yes”, I started yelling at her for over 30 mins and acted like an asshole to someone who was only checking on me. Same thing happens when I misplace something or have to repeat myself. Someone next to me parked bad? Let me yell/rant about it and exhaust myself and everyone around me.

Immediately after, I feel like absolute scum and want to cut/drink/do drugs/kill myself because I’m making life unbearable for everyone around me. I know how awful I am to be around and it makes me hate myself more than I already do.

For background, I’ve been living at home for the last 8 months after having a massive depressive episode my last semester of college. I want to go back in the fall but I feel like a massive embarrassment as a 23-yr old “super senior” and as someone who was always good at everything. 

I’ve always been known as “nice girl”, smiley and compliant. But now I get so fucking irritated to the point where every nerve in my body is on edge and my stomach is twisted. Like panic attacks but anger. I’ve never been physically violent in my life but sometimes i get this uncontrollable urge to cause damage. I feel so out of control and like a crazy person because my moods come so suddenly and I can only ride it out. It’s like I’ve become a different person. I’ve been replaced by a different person who’s cold, twisted and bitter. And what gets me is that there are parts of me that crave the anger and volatility. "
1,"you ever feel like your entire existence is wasted potential and you never became the person you were supposed to be?. i can't help feeling this way all the time. i look at the people around me and they've accomplished so much and done so much more than me. when i look at myself i see nothing special or interesting and it hurts more because i feel like i was supposed to be more, but i'm just nothing."
1,"One of the most frustrating things about depression is how much of an idiot you become the longer you're depressed. I feel like my brain has just rotted into swiss cheese. I used to have an incredible memory and now I can't remember what I did this morning (although doing nothing every day helps in this regard). I can't remember teachers names from high school or college without putting serious effort into it and even then I can't remember all of them. Seeing something about derivatives (math) and realizing that I took and passed calc 1 in college with a B but I literally can't remember what derivatives actually mean much less how to solve them is depressing in itself. It's like whatever work I managed to do 5-10 years ago is meaningless. It also makes the thought of going back to school impossible. 

I'd give anything to be average and to not constantly walk around forgetting what I'm doing or what I wanted to say. "
1,"People mourn you if you kill yourself and ask what they could've done to prevent it, yet they treat you like a pariah if you attempted to kill yourself and failed.. Sometimes I feel like people would appreciate my existence more if I were dead. Why is that?"
1,"Depression has turned me into a fucking idiot.. My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 

The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 

I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see ""if you wanted to, you would"" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.

I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.

"
1,"""Sleeping is nice because you're not actually dead and you're not awake so it's a win-win situation"". I saw this [here](http://i.imgur.com/UeOLWhV.png) and thought, fuck, this is my life. Every night I wish I could sleep and sleep and sleep."
1,"I'm depressed because I'm lonely. And I'm lonely because I'm depressed.. It's Catch-22. Fuck this shit.

EDIT: Does anyone want to talk? Maybe we can be a bit less lonely together."
1,"Depression has changed my memory-- has anyone else experienced this?. I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.

My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.

I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.

Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)"
1,"Does anyone feel like they aren't good enough to date someone?. Like your life is too boring? Like the fact that you have no friends and no prior relationship experience and nothing exciting about your life makes you not good enough? There was a guy I was interested in but I've decided its not worth it because a) I'm sure he's not interested in me and b) he has great people around him, does great things and really lives life, while I'm this shitty pile of nothingness."
1,"I’m a deeply depressed mental health professional. Does that make me a hypocrite?. I am a mental health counselor and student pursuing a Masters degree in Social Work to become a therapist.

I spend all day helping those who are depressed, suicidal, self-harming, anxious, but I can’t seem to apply any of the coping skills to myself.

I’m so depressed. I cry all the time over the smallest things. I daydream of relapsing back into cutting, even though I’m 3.5 years clean. I’m so anxious all the time. I want to die but I’m not actively trying to kill myself. One of the reasons why I haven’t killed myself yet is because I am scared that it will influence some of my clients to follow in my footsteps. But aside from that, I don’t have much interest in staying alive.

Am I a hypocrite for wanting to help others but not being able to help myself?"
1,"The only reason I wont kill myself is because I don't want to make my mom cry.. I want to die and I fantasize about killing myself everyday. The only reason I wont do it is because I do not want to hurt anyone. I am just here, rotting away."
1,"Nobody thinks depression is serious until suicide happens. I've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. Few know where I am. Those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of ""She's fine, just taking care of what she needs to."" Three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that I'm fine.


The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date


Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words ""fine"", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is ""less"" than a physical illness.  


I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 


Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something ""serious"" so that people wouldn't worry."
1,You guys prevented me from committing suicide yesterday. Thank you.. you guys are so kind and supportive of a complete stranger. I felt a strange comfort seeing your kind messages when I asked this subreddit to help me kill myself with painless suicide methods. Thank you. I havent felt that warm comforting feeling in a while. I cried.
1,"Yesterday a random girl on campus hugged me and I felt much better. I go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. Yesterday, I was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. On a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and I desperately needed help. I posted on Yik Yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (Yik Yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). I ended up deleting the post almost instantly because I felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. But within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if I was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while I choked back tears. I still can't believe it happened. I didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day. "
1,Is anyone else thinking of killing themselves after their parents die?. They're the only ones who would lose the will to live if I died. 
1,"""I'm just tired,"" has become my catchphrase, and a pretty huge lie, at this point.. The people I work with are quite bubbly, talkative, and sociable, but there are a lot of times I just don't have it in me to try to socialize. My job locks me in a room with 1-2 other people for 12 hours+, so talking and playing games is the only way to pass the time. When I'm not actively talking or contributing to the conversation and they ask me what's wrong, my response is always ""sorry, I'm just tired,"" when I mean ""sorry, I feel like a useless piece of shit today, you'll have to excuse me."" Do I want to socialize with my co-workers? Of course. Does my mood/brain want me to socialize? Hell no, it wants me to brood in the corner and overthink. 

I even do this in my personal relationships. When I'm in a bad mood (which is about 99% of the time anymore) and I shuffle around the house not really talking to anyone, and my mom or step-dad ask if I'm okay, my response is always ""I'm just tired,"" then I'll go to my room, shut my door, and only come out for basic necessities for the rest of the day. I haven't talked to my friends in God knows how long because I'm just not mentally prepared to most days. I'm scared I'll lose them eventually. My phone is never moved from where its set down when I came home from work because no one is concerned enough to talk to me unless they need something. "
1,"Who else lives their life in a fantasy world?. I spend probably 90% of my days daydreaming. Sitting in class, watching TV, playing video games etc I'm always daydreaming

I go to this fantasy world where I actually have a passion and I actually have support and friends where I'm the best at something. Some cultural icon.

It's unhealthy and it's caused me to stop myself from ever being happy in life. How could I ever be happy when all I think about is what if I was someone else? Some amazing artist? Musician? And not just this talentless loser who will spend the majority of his life grinding a 9-5 and the most exciting thing I do is play video games on the weekends?

And then I get the whole bullshit about ""well instead of daydreaming about it, go start finding your passion and get good at it""

I'm hoping you guys know that that is just bullshit. It hurts me every time. I'm tired of hearing it.

Learning how to accept being a nobody sucks. Idk if I will ever fully accept it."
1,"Do you guys ever feel ashamed for having depression?. Sometimes I think about my current situation I'm in and I think: "" I have no reason to be depressed"" and sometimes I see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes I feel ashamed to think I have depression when I think of other people's misfortune despite my own misfortune.

I even avoid saying I'm depressed and just say I'm sad now because I feel like I'm insulting those who are depressed."
1,"The scariest part is when depression becomes so normal you forget what happiness really felt like. When I was 16 it was so strange to me. I have a journal entry where I wrote, ""This isn't who I'm supposed to be."" Everybody noticed me go from goofy A-student to constantly skipping classes and looking so empty and sad.

I tried to fight it. I really did. But fast-forward 11 years and the 16-year-old me is gone. The intelligence is there, just not applied towards anything useful or productive. The humor is there sometimes, just more morbid and mostly kept to myself. 

I am constantly fatigued, unfocused, sad, irritable, pessimistic, and anxious. The most common coping mechanisms I have that give me comfort are food and TV/games. ""Oh but I'm NOT really like this—it's my depression!"" That's what I said for a fucking decade and I can't even believe it anymore.

My depression is who I am now most of the time, and it's been that way for years. It's become my personality. It's become so normal I don't remember that people aren't supposed to feel and act like this. It's not fucking normal to take a few hours to get out of bed, not shower for days, and do nothing but binge eat, watch TV, play games, and sleep for days and even weeks on end. I can't stand it anymore.

I just took a Wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time. Fuck it, can't get any worse. I have to tell myself that I have a serious problem and the only way is to get help. Because if I don't then I'm back in that damn pit again, feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it. 

"
1,"Anyone else constantly check their phone even though you never receive anything?. I woke up with 30 Reddit notifications, thank you all for making me feel valued."
1,"Does anyone else feel guilty about being depressed?. I just feel guilty about being sad all the time. Like I have a decent life, no financial trouble, or family deaths, so I feel like I don’t deserve to be depressed. I always think about how much worse other people have it in life, and it makes me think I’m just spoiled and unappreciative."
1,"I just showered. Tomorrow I start a new job. Feeling hopeful.. Reddit,

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

All of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod I think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. 

Here's a little something about my first day:

These new co-workers, I already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty Cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the IT guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but I can't help but chuckle at that. The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now. 

I assisted during one procedure today. And it went well. My preceptor has twenty years of experience in GI and I can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. I can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. And has the answers to my simple questions. I'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but I'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before I move to #2 then #3.

I also was given a few checklists to complete. One was computer education, which I completed entirely. Long story short, I had a great first day!!"
1,I did it guys.. I talked to a girl and actually got her number. As someone with sever anxiety and depression I finally did it. She even called me cute and complimented me on my hair. For the first time in a long time I feel something.
1,"I'm just here. Nothing else. I'm a fucking side character in everyone's life, including my own. My personality is so fucking boring, I tried to make myself more interesting through art and fashion but turns out I'm still the same sad piece of shit. I understand why I'm not super important to anyone, I would fucking hate me too if I met me. It's my own fault and i know it but I have no idea of how to change it, it just feels like my purpose is so observe everyone else and stay quiet. I have no idea where I'm going with my life, and I don't think it's gonna go anywhere if I'm being honest. Sorry if you read all of this bullshit, end of rant"
1,"I want to sleep so I don't have to be awake yet also sad because it'll make tomorrow arrive sooner. I want to be asleep so I don't have to feel the crushing emptiness, to escape the painful loneliness and to have some relief from feeling lost. I'll snuggle up with my teddy bears as best as I can and try and sleep.... though what's the point if it makes tomorrow arrive sooner? Tomorrow... another day of feeling like this. Another day of feeling like this. Then another and another.

1,"I understand now what my neighbor said to me years back. he's 5 years older than me, i remember it was like summer of 2013 and i just started dodging social events, i remember one day binging season 6 of how i met your mother while all of my friends(back when i had any) were outside playing football and messing around the entire day,

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: 

*you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*

i always found it funny how he's giving me advices and shit but he is fucked up himself, it's ironic how i'm exactly like him right now, soon to be 23, unemployed for 8 months, exhausted from social anxiety and depression, i spend most of the time inside on pc, watching my friends on social media being happy and having such normal lives, big majority of ppl i know has left for jobs or college"
1,"Feeling like I'm faking depression. I don't know about you guys, but I constantly feel like I'm just a lazy piece of shit, and not somebody with depression.

Doesn't matter how many suicidal thoughts I have... Nah, just a lazy shitbag who doesn't give a fuck about their degree and spends hours a day on League of Legends. 

That's me. It's great. Especially when it's backed up by your parents complaining that you don't actually study. "

1,"My BF is cleaning his car and it's a big deal to me.. As the title shows I know this won't be important to others but my BF has been suffering from severe depression after dealing with a loss and he is in the car detailing business. He has let his car go to where there was dirt and trash and piles upon piles of ""things"" in his back seats. I have only ever mentioned the state of his car once to him but I knew ultimately it would be up to him to clean it (I know I could have but when it comes to him and his car, he is the only one to do stuff to it. He just lets me drive it when I want). Well today is the DAY and even though it's something small he has been making all these steps to better himself and I support him every day as much I possibly can. I just had to tell someone :)

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: I just want to thank everyone who commented I honestly thought that only like 8 people might even like this or upvote it. I want to let you all know he had a good day and that we are doing great. I personally have suffered from depression (diagnosed at 13) for a large portion of my life and I honestly think thats what has been so great that when he has bad days/weeks and shows all the symptoms I have learned when he needs me to just be beside him and when to give him space and remind him of my constant support and love. It's not easy but it has been the easiest thing for me to love him the way I do. I hope you all find the joy in the little things and wish you all the best!"
1,"I am so lonely. Does anyone ever have that feeling of ""I want to go home"" but home isn't your old house or your family or a time in your life before . It's a feeling that you miss but you don't actually have anymore. "
1,I made my bed. Guys I know this might be stupid.  But I finally was able to make my bed. Like I mean having sheets on it and stuff. I know otherwise it's gross. This is really big for me. I final didn't feel like it was useless to do. Sorry. I'm gross. But I'm actually proud. (Wish it didn't happen at 3:30 am because I can't sleep but oh well I got a burst of energy so I did it.) I'm feeling tired now but I hope this boost will stay tomorrow to clean other things.  Sorry if this sounds stupid.
1,"I feel like I have the memory, of another persons life. My life has changed dramatically over the past two years, im 16 now.

Now im severe depressed, not going to School for a year, not socialsing at all. Im trapped in this spiral, im dealing with metamagical thinking and existential thoughts. Im just hoping for some new technology and treatment. And im also currently writing about depression, like the biology of depression.

1,"I can't even figure out how to get government benefits, this sucks. I think I messed up my taxes or something. I'm only getting $66/week in unemployment, that extra $600 a week isn't showing up even though it's supposed to be for everyone on unemployment. And everyone has been getting that $1200 stimulus check, meanwhile it's saying there's nothing available for my account.

I worked part time for minimum wage, and I can't even figure out how to get benefits. That's how pathetic I am.

If that money doesn't come through by next week, I'm gonna hang myself"
1,"""You're too funny"" I wasn't trying to be funny. I am no longer close with this friend even though we live in the same city. I've gotten together with her twice last year just to reconnect.  I know she leads a busy life with her husband and kids but during this pandemic they are all home. 

I'm going to a farm an hour away to pick up maple syrup which it is cheaper to buy in a large quantity as opposed to buying a small jar in the grocery store.

I sent her and another friend a text that if they would like to buy also  I'll drop off the jug at their doorstep. My one friend declined since her mother had purchased some for her already and thanked me for thinking of her. But the other friends' response was ""Lol, your too funny. We are all good for Maple Syrup, we have lots"".

I am taken aback by her response. Am I reading into this too much?"
1,"Putting a pillow over your face when you cry is a top tier way of crying. Basically the title. I've been crying more than usual recently and honestly just lying on your back with a pillow on your face is so good.

Hi guys, I’m 16 years of age nearly 17 , I’ve had a great life, nothing to be sad about but over the last week or two I have been showing all the signs of depression; breaking down over the smallest things, no motivation to do anything, tired all the time and just that general emptiness, I have been smoking weed for a a year or 2 now and everyday for the past few months, I’m not sure if this is why I’m depressed or what but I just wanted to ask a few questions, 
1) would quitting cannabis be a good idea? And why? 
2) please give me some advice on the best ways you found to cope with depression.
3) and finally, does it get better because right now I feel it never will:/ 
Thank you in advance to anyone commenting, just know your helping. ❤️"
1,How’s quarantine treating everyone. For me it’s a mess the only thing that used to bring me happiness were my friends which I am great full for. But everyone says stay in touch but dose any one actually no how hard that is. The foundation of my happiness is gone I can only hope that this virus ends soon.
1,Im tired of arguing. Im tired of dissagreements. I just want peace. I fucking hate drama. Why can’t people just agree with something for once?
1,"Hi all. 
I am 20 years old male
I came across a health issue 6 months ago and how I dealt with it is.. eye opening.

I had some stomach issues stem up. There was a thought in my mind that I had bowel cancer because I had all the symptoms, blood in stool, constipation, you name it. The night before my blood tests and a stool test that looks for blood, I cried thinking about it. What was I thinking about? I was imagining that the doctor says they found what I was fearing. Then I started thinking what I would tell my family. Would I lie? Say that I love them all and they have been all I ever wanted and more? 

Or would I tell the truth? Would I tell them how I truly felt about them? Maybe so they could change? Would I tell them that I don’t mind if something in my bowels is gonna kill me?

I mean, I am not going to lie, when I had that fear from built up anxiety, I actually wanted to live. I really did. But here I am months later, back to my normal life. Why did these feelings go? Why can’t I get this feeling when I am healthy? Why am I suicidal now, but when I was close to “death” I wanted to live so badly?

Mind you, this is not the first night that I felt this way. I’ve had uncountable nights and days that I had this feeling. In fact, 6 years ago when I was 13 I dreamed that I blew my h*** off with a shotg** in the balcony. Then I turned into a ghost and went inside my house, telling my family how Sorry I am but nobody replies or sees me. I woke up crying. Since that dream I promised myself I would never do such a thing. My thoughts might say that theyre better off without me, but I know, from that dream, that if I go that way I won’t make anything better. 


I just don’t get why I came into existence. I want to die. Why can’t I just die? What do I do?"

1,"Boyfriend seems to go through depressive weeks, any tips for how to help him cope?. As the title says, my boyfriend goes through periods of depression. He'll be fine one week and the next his brain will be telling him it'd be easier if he weren't around.

Obviously I absolutely hate seeing him go through this, and I try to do simple things like make him great meals and pick movies to watch I think he'll love etc--but I don't really know how to best support him. I know I can't fix things for him but I'd love to ease them a little even.

Any suggestions?"
1,"[Vent] invalidated and unwilling to open up. my sister has depression but sometimes i feel like she feels she's the only one allowed to feel sad. i haven't ever told her how sad i get sometimes because she usually offers advice like going outside or learn a hobby. i've sought counseling and was referred to a therapist but i haven't told my family because i'm so scared of the reaction. i was even prescribed anti depressants, which i haven't taken because they're so expensive and i'm worried about withdrawals.

the other day i responded to her i don't really have any hobbies and her response was like ""if we felt that way about everything, we wouldn't get anything done.""

any time i reference depression she makes me feel like i don't know what i'm talking about.

1,Life is confusing. I literally have no idea why I still exist.  There are people who actually enjoy living and are happy and have so much going for them.  I don’t contribute anything valuable to the world.  All I do is take up space.  Thank goodness I will be dead later this year.  That brings me a sense of peace.
1,Is anyone willing to hear me rant?. My fathers wife died. When I met her and my father a few years ago I could tell she was the one who was really trying to make up for lost time. Shes been there for me and I genuinely loved her. No one told me about her passing. I only saw a snapchat post from my sister. I feel like I'm about to break. There's the grief from her passing mixed with all of my issues with rejection combined into one nice emotional break down.
1,"if you've ghosted people who you consider friends, how do you react when you see them next?. like no response or explanation to your lack of interest in responding to them when they reach out or check in with you but you've got no energy to reply to them since it's overwhelming or too much

how do you react when you enjoy their company and they seem upset when seeing them after getting over a depressive episode: explain, leave them be, etc.?"
1,"Dead inside and depressed for years... help. A bit of background - I’m a 22 year old male. Growing up I was very sensitive to peoples feelings, the world around me, found everything funny and was all in all a very happy, caring and loved person.

Through high school I smoked weed maybe once or twice every 6 months or so, so not a lot... mostly because I was sensitive to it and had strong reactions. 

Anyway, at 17 some buddies and I camped out overnight. My life has never been the same after that night. I had a soul destroying terrifying experience that truly can’t be explained with words. I can only describe it as an episode in which I experienced the most extreme physical pain, fear, terror, paranoia, anxiety, crazy visuals, blacking out, my sight was MESSED up, losing control of my entire body, and so SO much more for several hours before ‘reality’ started to return I never really spoke about it because my words really don’t do it justice at all. It was literally hell and my brain went through something extreme, I know it.

Things were a bit weird after this but nothing too noticeable. Looking back, this is when my life went from being colourful to slowly fading away. I’m no brain expert but I feel like my brain was so deeply traumatised that it changed into some sort of safety mode, causing me to feel NOTHING and empty, all the time.

My symptoms;
- I feel empty all the time. I can’t remember the last time I felt any emotion, good or bad.
- anhedonia ( I cant remember the last time I really felt pleasure from anything )
- no sex drive what so ever (this wasn’t the case before the accident) 
- erectile dysfunction 
- basically I can’t feel anything, it’s like my brain doesn’t react to anything that happens anymore. I don’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed.
-I can’t cry, I sometimes lie in bed trying so hard to cry but nothing happens.
- I used to have a sense of self, I feel like a walking dead body now with nothing going on inside of me
- constantly fatigued and don’t care about anything 
- loss of imagination and my thoughts are so distant and empty

I’ve tried Zoloft on a 100mg dose for 3 months and felt no change what so ever in me. I’ve tried mirtazapine 30mg for 3 months and nothing happened other than appetite increase.

Please help, I’d love to be the old me again.

Edit : the symptoms list was not exhaustive and this post only really touched the surface, so any questions please ask!"

I wish I knew what it was like to be loved by a man, but not through sexual desire, to have someone walk me down the isle when I’m getting married, someone who was there to help me with the hard homework, someone who would joke around with me, someone who would love me as a daughter.

1,"It gets better.. I’ve been on this subreddit for a couple months, and here is what I learned:

*It gets better*

When I was diagnosed I started going on this subreddit, putting posts up on my worst days and talking with some of you.

I can say without a doubt that if you are going through the shit right now you won’t believe me. 

You won’t feel like it gets better.

That is the core of why depression is the life sucking cancer it is.

If you told me two months ago that everything would be okay I wouldn’t believe you for shit.

But I’m lucky enough to be able to say it does 
I’m lucky enough to be able to say this here that *it does get better*.

The reason I’m making this post is for those who don’t believe it will get better. No matter how many times I say it you won’t believe me so I’m asking you you please keep swimming, and you will make it.

I have no idea your face or your name but I swear man everyone has fight in them and if you’ve got the courage to reach out on this subreddit then without a doubt you have the fight in you to overcome depression.

I hope your days become less awful until they finally become good ones again.

Keep swimming."
1,"Just want to be at peace. I want to go somewhere far away. Away from this country. Probably live in the countryside or mountains alone and just read.

I hate being in the city. Everything is loud. Everything is a mess. Being quarantined with my family messes me up more. I'll probably kms before I get to do it. I want to leave.

 I want a peace of mind. My mind is in a haze right now. I could only think of one quick solution to be at peace."
1,"A close friend leaves my messages unopened, when I attempt to open up about my depression. I helped him through a similar struggle about half a year ago. I know it isn't good to keep score in friendship but it is beginning to bother me. Any advice on what I should do is welcome.. Around a year ago I fell into quite a bad depression as well as anxiety. In order to save time I won't go into the details of my personal symptoms. 

However for the last 3-4 months, I've been making quite a big effort to pull myself out of the depression with some success. However from time to time daily I do fall back into my old thought patterns. During this time I usually managed by keeping to myself(for 2-3hrs) and making an effort to keep myself busy through one of my hobbies (I'm 17 and live with my family so talk to them regardless of my mood). Usually my sprinting practice is the most successful at getting me out of the mental state. 

Very recently I began speaking to a counselor (online due to the quarantine circumstances). It hasn't caused much difference yet but I am still hopeful. The counselor recommended that I still reach out to 1 or 2 closer friends during times where I feel like this. This is different to my usual method however I was happy to try it.

**The main issue:**

When choosing someone to talk about it with, I chose a friend who I know had also been through a similar mental struggle and had opened up to me about it. When this happened, I was always happy to talk to him and help him through it. Therefore I assumed it'd be good to talk with him as he'd be able to relate. 

However, when I've tried talking about what I'm going through with him after a few messages he'll just leave my message unopened (for around a day), this is unusual because if we're having a usual conversation he'd reply sooner. After having done this he'll begin a conversation on a completely different topic. Basically ignoring what I said before. The first time this happened I just ignored it thinking that it was probably a coincidence. I spaced out each attempt by a few weeks. However after the 2nd and 3rd time it began to bother me. Especially when I see him posting on his story or group-chats etc.

Therefore, I am wondering if anyone has had something similar happen? and what did they do about it? Should I just communicate what I've noticed and be honest that it's bothering me (this feels quite odd for me to do as I'm usually quite a jokey person and we usually joke around together)."
1,"Is anyone else sad for all the time they spent before they found out about their depression and got help for it?. In high school, everyone told me that when you turned 18 you had to go be independent and self sufficient. My first year of college went ok. But the second year, I became profoundly depressed. I stopped going to classes and my grades suffered. I thought at the time maybe that I was just gaming the system by skipping class because you can skip class in college with fewer consequences. But what was really going on was that I was depressed and I spent all this time on Facebook or just staring at my wall and listening to music, feeling sorry for myself. But I never wanted help because I never wanted to look weak. And I never realized there was a problem with an expectation that you avoid looking weak at all costs. That was an undeniable fact life had taught me (so I thought). I didn't realize I was still affected by my childhood trauma. I didn't talk to anyone. I spent years like that, trying to work and study and always being fucked over by depression/trauma, and failing to recognize it as such. I thought I was just worthless, unable to work hard because of some internal defect. I remember scouring the DMV thinking I had to have some personality disorder. I became obsessed with introversion and the MBTI because I then thought ""oh I can't do the shit I need to do because I'm an INTP trapped in an extrovert feeler world"". I kept deluding myself by following every failure with an ""it must be because I'm too smart for everything"" pep talk. My life is not a bed of roses now, but at least I acknowledged I needed help for depression and PTSD, and got it. 

Anyway, TL;DR is that I spent over a decade in denial of my trauma and depression."
1,"For me, it feels like I'm in a swamp.. So figured I'd type this out on how I felt on this since it sucks. First off, my family has a history with depression. I know my grandmother has it, my father has it, and my grandfather may have had it too. Ever since middle school just year after year I felt worse and worse. Now I'm 23 with one good real life friend (who is my best friend) and one good online friend. Been single for like 7-8 years and just hate it. A long time ago had some of my old friends confide in me about being suicidal (even my best friend) and I tried to help them out the little I could (fortunately they're still with us). Though that's left me with no one I felt like I could turn to.   
Once out of high school I felt like I was in a swamp. Its thick muddy waters that makes it hard to move in. While you got all sorts of dangerous creatures like alligators and snakes watching your every move. On top of the blood sucking mosquitoes and leeches that latch onto to you day after day. At first I'd try my best to move forward you know, try to get somewhere, to get out of the swamp but no matter how hard I tried, how fast I moved, I always wound up back in the same spot of the swamp. I'd see lights and hear voices and I'd go toward them and yell out with my arm reaching for anything, but nothing ever happened and again I was in the same spot. As days went on, my will to move forward, call out, reach out, all faded away. But I'm an insane fool, and every so often I try again, reaching, moving, yelling, only to end up back in my little spot. I get rid of the leeches and swat the mosquitoes and even chase away the snakes but I don't bother with the alligator. Cause I wake up every morning, wishing that I didn't. Every day it feels like I look at that alligator and ask ""Why haven't you eaten me yet?"" and I never get an answer.  
So I'm just standing still, in my little spot. Watching as things go by, and people pass me. Waiting for the day where either someone finally pulls me out or the day that gator finally gets me."
1,"Been reading ""Scar Tissue"" by RHCP singer Anthony Kiedis.. Been binging it today, read for seven hours and will continue. Man I can relate to him. If you like their music, have a history of depression and drug use, I recommend it. It seems like it's been giving me some strength."
1,"Guilty for Feeling Good?. So on Twitter a few days ago, I saw [this article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-making-a-lot-of-people-anxious-and-depressed-but-some-sufferers-actually-feel-better-now). Basically, it talks about how a minority of people with depression/anxiety are actually feeling better in the midst of this pandemic.

The causes of what I'm feeling aren't really talked about in the article, but I mention it for some context.

This pandemic is inflicting widespread suffering and I would give back every moment I've had of happiness so that it'd go away this instant. But like..I'm feeling pretty good? 

I think it's because in times of crisis, humanity tends to come together. I've communicated more with my friends in the past few weeks than I normally do. We've played MarioKart and Animal Crossing online, we've video-called, we're starting up a tabletop game...I haven't been allowed in sink into my depressive habit of isolating myself and then wondering why no one will reach out to me.

It's...really nice. It's given me the motivation to do more chores and get interested in my old hobbies again. I just wish this awful virus didn't have to be (at least part of) the reason why I'm experiencing this. :\\

Anybody else relate??"
1,"I'm in urgent of a need to find a way to delete my memories.... Please look at my last post for more information. I will not be linking it here.

1,"I feel like I'm out of options.. I've never posted here but I can't see my friends and reaching out to any of them is just going to make me feel like a burden.
My professors will put in emails ""hows working from home"" or ""how are you doing"" and i know that i have to falsify and answer because they don't care. 

The week i finally decided to apply for Medicaid (my health insurance doesn't cover therepy)  and get in the process of maybe getting help i got kicked off my campus because of coronavirus, and in person sessions are out of the question in any capacity. This was in mid march. 

Now I'm at home. I live with my sister and parents and my sister at least can acknowledge I'm suffering but i feel like my parents can't even fathom what I'm going through and i hate them for that. They talk about how terrible this quarantine is when they both work from home and have an easy time waking up every day. I wake up and have to fight myself to even leave my bed. I know they view this as laziness.

I feel anxiety even leaving my room now because i don't feel equipped to deal with whats outside my door. 
I get halfway through making meals sometimes and just stop because its not worth it. If i burn something it usually means I'm not eating because i don't have the will to remake it.

I get angry with deadlines a lot and hurt myself sometimes. I never really mean to it just kind of happens. I'll be working on something that just isn't coming together and i feel like i need to take it out on something and I'm usually the most deserving thing in the room. I haven't cut myself in years but now i just bruise or let myself go hungry.

I just have so much fucking damage and I don't know where to start putting it. I've been shoving it under the rug for so long im pressed up against the ceiling. Sometimes depression doesn't feel like something i have it feels like something i do. I feel like i choose being depressed over feeding myself, or doing my homework, or interacting with others.

I feel like my life isnt just on hold but regressing, I feel like all the trauma I've gotten from others and damage I've given myself has no value. All i can think about is how much time I've obliterated feeling bad, and how I'm never getting it back, and how I'm never going to stop adding to it.

I guess the last option is just acceptance that this is my life and hoping the clock runs out as quickly and painlessly as possible."

I'm sure I'm a worthless stupid piece of shit that doesn't deserve love but sometimes when somebody can't do an easy task to me or sometring like that a rain of narcissict thoughts come to my head saying I'm a more smart or better human being than the rest of the world and it makes me feel confused and hate myself even more.
1,"What a roller coaster it's been. At the age of 14 I became depressed, I was lonely and without friends. At the age of 17 I dropped out of school because I was set on ending my life and didn't see a point in attending school anymore. At the age of 19 I had spent 2 years in complete solitude at home speaking to no one except exchanging a few words with my parents every now and then, I had grown apathetic towards everything. I think this is were I died, at the age of 19, no longer responsive and without a single care in the world, just a hopeless, jobless, education less bum leeching of his parents waiting for death to claim him. I'm now about to turn 21 and I can safely say that I've lost a lot, including the ability to feel shame, the ability to  care for myself, the ability to be happy, the ability to be sad. 

Everything regarding myself is of no value to me, I value insects above myself. All I have left is empathy and sympathy towards others, which is why I cannot kill myself. And so I'm left in limbo, I've got nowhere to go, all I can do is wait and see where fate takes me. I sincerely hope I die."
1,Only when i’m in the *heat of the moment* upset or angry I think about harming myself. Then immediately after i’m like no you can’t do that.

I’m 18 and just really confused.

1,"I am the undesired, the unwanted, the unloved. And I am miserable.. I am the shadow you never see, the gutter trash you ignore, the rain that forces you to cancel plans, the wind that carries all you love away with it. I am hated, misunderstood, abused, ostracized, discarded, the punching bag.


I’m the bad guy.

1,"Not depressed,but i don't belong here.. I'm just a selfish person,i don't care about anyone else except for me. As far as i am concerned,everyone should die. This might sound edgy but i just feel like it. I'm really happy with my life,probably happier than 99,9% of people today. I just don't feel like i belong here. I do lots of philosophy in my head about things that bother me like what is right and wrong,why do we live... It just doesn't seem right,but who am i to say that,i can't even distinguish right from wrong because i don't believe in things like that. I just sometimes feel like i want to fucking kill myself. Lots of people would be hurt by it but i don't really care. Only thing that is stopping me is that i have a life goal. My life goal is childish to some people,to some it seems determined but it's my fucking thing,i don't care what they say. My life goal is to have a good gaming setup and just play games and watch anime. But there is this thing,school in the future work... There is so much more to life than just going to 8 hours a day at work/school,and sleeping 8 hours a day. I don't want to go to school,lemme just do my fucking thing. i was born to enjoy,not to go to school like a fucking retard tied to system. After i accomplish my goal,i'm almost 16,so it's gonna be soon,i'll kill myself. Life without goals is as good as dead. I don't really care about having a wife and a family and all that normal shit. In few years i'll probably kill myself. I don't ask for any help because i don't need it. Not afraid of death or anything,but being alive in a world where i'm tied to a system just isn't for me. I just wanted to throw this out here,huge thanks to people who read it until the end."
1,"Peaked a year ago, still picking up the pieces.. TL;DR: (Life was perfect a year ago, everything went to shit. Don’t know how to be more disciplined / productive and don’t know where the boundary of ADHD / Depression ends and when me being undisciplined starts)

Hi. So two years ago I basically was on the top of my game. I was doing really well in school (then a junior in high school), got the job of a lifetime, and had awesome productivity / work life balance. This was also my first year in school being diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive, Anxiety, and Depression. (diagnosed end of sophomore year)

Everything fell apart. I lost the job, my dad went to hospital, I accumulated debt by borrowing money from friends while sustaining myself while my dad was in the hospital, grades died, etc.

My dad is now fine, and I’m recovering in most aspects in a stable way except my productivity and discipline. 

(BIG NOTE: My medication has never really been a good thing. I used to be on meds but I haven’t taken meds regularly in a long time. My meds make my heart rate go crazy and generally worsen every aspect of both my ADHD and Anxiety and essentially only works after the meds wear off and I’m on the come down.)

I have so many aspirations. I want to continue doing design. I want to pursue music too. I want to do well in school. I want to continue to watch a ton of YouTube and anime and such and be cultured and on top of what’s going on in the world right now. Yet this is an example of how my days have been going.

10 AM: I wake up. 
1 PM: I work out
10 PM: I finish some assignments that are dude before midnight
12 AM: PS4 / Anime
3 AM: Bed

I don’t know where the time goes. I don’t really enjoy my time, nor am I productive. My friends give me advice which I read and agree that it’s logical but yet i still find myself at the end of the day asking what did I just do.

😔"
1,"I don't know what to do anymore(rant). I had depression since 14 and it was getting progressively worse and worse until I had a breakdown and got kicked out of school. I did go to the doctor but she just stuffed me full of pills and nothing else and therapist my parents found is spiritual so I stopped going to her. My psychiatrist just tells to go outside. She never told me what exactly I have I just assumed from my symptoms. Bipolar depression and social anxiety, can't leave the house because of panic attacks even with medication and can't handle stress at all, I'll just have panic attacks and another breakdown. I tried to apply for welfare coming to conclusion I'll never be able to work and at least try to focus on my hobbies that I somewhat enjoy and get some little money from them and the welfare. But I got rejected saying ""I see nothing requiring a welfare here"" as the worker looked at the report from my psychiatrist. I managed to get a sick note from my main doctor but that will end soon and I'll have to go look for a job or make my parents pay for my insurance and I already think I'm a parasite for just living with them and wanting money on things from time to time. I just don't know what to do anymore and would rather die than to put my parents into debt, especially now that so many people lost their jobs. I've gotten bit better after not having to worry about stuff but am sure I'd just have more breakdowns if I had to go somewhere daily or have deadlines. But I suppose I'm just a lazy piece of shit that should just shut up, stop complaining, man up and get a job."

1,I've reached my breaking point. I'm done. I can't deal with this anymore everything is just becoming too much to handle. I don't want to be me anymore. I'm sick of constant abuse from my school friends. I'm sick of not being able to be with the people I love. I'm sick of thinking about the people I've lost. In sick of being alone and I am all around sick of being stuck in this world. I'm not supposed to be here.
1,"i really hate the human tendency to make fun of people or take pleasure in people's suffering. it seems to be everywhere though, and i can't escape it unless isolate myself from humanity, which would also make me unhappy.

Keep going it will happen"
1,"Am I depressed/suicidal?. I don't want to kill myself but I also really don't want to live my life. A little bit about my thought process. 

I've had mixed feelings on this label. I'm the kind of person who won't test for something so that it doesn't exist. Like dyslexia, I was offered a test in Uni and didn't take it because the answer is no I don't have dyslexia until proven otherwise.

I have this same mentality with depression. I also wouldn't even know where to start. people say go see a gp but I've never had one and I'm not in a position to see one without my family asking questions. 

I'm also not into self-diagnosis and would never say I have depression. I may be depressed or feeling down from time to time but I just don't know.

I've always been self-aware and existential (if that's even a word). I've always thought why this life. Why am I in this body. Why do I have these feelings, these emotions and these motivations or lack of movitation. I feel like there should be a grand scheme to things but I can't dedicate myself to one with no evidence. I'd love to believe in reincarnation but what's the point if you cant remember a past life. Id love to believe in afterlife but like does that mean for 80+years you get on earth you get an eternity of just watching sounds tedious. I'd love to believe in heaven but then does that mean there is a hell.

Anyway down to the main point. I'm going to try and put this into words but I don't even know what to call it. I am not suicidal, I don't want to kill myself but at the same time I don't want to carry on living. 1. I don't think I would kill myself 2. Even though I'm meh on my family I wouldn't put them through that 3. If a truck ran me over next week my instant thought would not be ""no i have so much to live for""

I feel like I'm done with life. I don't want to carry on. I don't want to make decisions that could backfire. I don't want to make a wrong move and regret my past (although I hardly regret things). I don't want to try and get out of my funk and become social again. I've always struggled with friends, my relationships and my passions. My whole life is made up of; I want to do this  I pursue it, get so far and then for whatever reason its done - over with. I don't want to keep doing that.

Life is too much of a gamble and I just don't want to risk it. It's like a game and I'm done playing but I can't bring myself to quit. I don't enjoy playing I'd rather I naturally land on a square and go bankrupt and lose the game (monopoly). It's like I don't want to see what positives are out there I'm not ready to risk the negatives and the positives aren't enticing anymore I'd just rather not play at all. Even if someone said here's a free pass I'd rather just not do it.

There's too much unknowns in life and out of it. Does what I do with my life effect my afterlife if there even is one and ultimately do I care.

I really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this being so long I just felt like I need to put it into words and see if anyone has experienced similar things."
1,"Help I keep hallucinating on Zoloft / Sertraline. 

Hallucinations

Hi! I’ve been on Sertraline for almost a year now. On 150mg a day. I’ve been to hundreds of doctors as I keep neglecting my treatment and moving but each dr increases my dose and pushes me out the door.

Recently I’ve been having severe symptoms, I’ve been really strongly visually hallucinating. I’m not talking about like an odd shape I literally imagined the floor crumbling underneath me and was convinced I was going to drop in to hell. I saw stuff like the world look like I was trapped in a game, and lots of dark haunting scary looking people. In the night I kept walking up as I was certain I heard someone walking in the house and kept seeing someone walk in to the room who wasn’t there. I’ve been having severe tremors so sometimes I can’t pick anything up and I wake up in the night soaked in sweat. 

I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? Do you think this could be the tablets?"
1,"As soon as someone ask me if I’m ok I just shut down and start talking about something else. I’m not ok, or am I? I’m actually not 100% sure if I’m faking it or not at this point."
1,"I need some advice (TW: self harm / suicide). So I posted before about having visual hallucinations on Sertraline (please see other post) 

I have since come off Sertraline and started coming on to citalopram. Since my last post I have been extremely tired but also very agitated. Like my mind is ping ponging everything possible and getting things confused on the way. I can’t seem to finish anything I start because I don’t care and my friends have said a lot of things I say don’t make sense or are from an old conversation or I’ve started a new one. I’ve also been experiencing really distressing thoughts of paranoid nature i was convinced my mum broke in to my house and was stalking me and was convinced I was being followed at night. I am also convinced that my next door neighbour is a murderer. I’m feeling more level now and realise that was silly but I’m entering a stage of numbness. I’ve been entering a stage of severe suicide idealation I can’t seem to shake and I’m worried I will act.  

Is this my tablets? Anyone have similar experiences"
1,"Leaving. So if I kill myself then it's the worst thing ever to my family, but I'm thinking of just packing my essentials leaving my phone a driving as far as my truck goes on a tank of gas then walking. No idea where I'd walk to maybe somewhere else but I think I've hit the point where I just can't take other people telling me how I should feel and how I should live my life.
I've had depression for around 20 years now and it's just awful. I understand those who say it'll get better but when it does it's simply when is it going to go downhill again? I've been on the back and forth for years had 2 vehicles totally paid off had 2 jobs that I loved to work at, had the whole thing. But even having financial security, food, shelter, drugs, friends/family. None of it has ever made me happy.
We live in a society that says we need things, people, drugs, or a certain outlook to have a happy life.
I don't want to be here anymore, I feel abused. Like I can never be myself because everyone has built up a perception of me and when I act like myself I'm ridiculed for being different or told that's not how it works or you can't feel that way.
The problem is I do feel this way and I always have, it's gotten to the point where I believe my own thoughts to be cancerous even if they make me feel better because I've been led to believe I have to be someone and something I just am not and every day I have to pretend that I'm ok and love this shit just feels like I'm slowly suffocating my real self.

I've gotten to the point over the last 3-4 months where I'm trying to die. I've pretty much stopped eating fruit in hopes vitamin deficiency will kill me. I try to avoid protein to just waste my muscles away. I've started only drinking alcohol and refusing to intake water, I've had 5 glasses in 2 weeks, just in hopes my kidneys shut down. I've even been trying to smoke cigarettes, which I fucking hate, just because I want to do damage to my lungs and have had asthma so I know they are getting fucked.

I feel like if I just leave this life behind, not suicide, then I could possibly become the person who I have always wanted to be. So i either can slowly watch myself rot and pretend to be alright, which what I've done for the last 15 years, or I attempt to try again somewhere else without any past, family or friends."

It’s really lame."

I know I'm a loser

i know no one wants to talk to me

i know no one wants to be near me

I know people look down on me

i know I'm worthless.

why is that so hard for everyone else to understand. I am not worthy of kindness or nice things. Strangers understand, but those close to me won't let me shrivel up, i want to give up, and i don't want to exist any more. The world knows I'm a worthless piece if shit why can't you."

1,"No-one's going to see this, but I can't bury all my mistakes, so who knows?. I don't quite know why this hit me so hard. Two days ago, I was drawing and out of nowhere burst into tears. It was 1:30 in the morning, and it was just me awake. I wasn't listening to sad music, nothing thag could have started it. I just remember rushing to close my sketchbook, turning in to the wall, and sobbing.

The real kicker was today. Turns out, like the idiot I am, I forgot I was taking a course and susbequently had 4 weeks' worth of schoolwork to make up. One of my teachers emailed me about this, of course. I gave a generic stress mixed with technology errors (I wasn't seeing any assignments in that course showing up, which was true), and crawled under the bed to cry. Because I'm that pathetic and cowardly.

I haven't told my parents out of fear that I will lose tech privileges, but it's an overwhelming amount of work and I don't know if I have the will to make it all back up. People say when you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to go but up. I say that they forget where the devil lives. (Watch everyone ignore this post, lmao)"

1,A lot of people think depression is just being sad all the time. Its more like the absence of any emotion at all.. At least for me. I can't speak for everyone but I feel no joy. No sadness. Nothing. It really destroys me because I want to feel something but nothing works.

1,"I can’t see the only person who helped me feel better with my depression and anxiety.. I was starting to get better and manage my anxiety and depression but being sent into quarantine ripped away my only comfort. I was working to be able to hold myself up but I was still in the process of needing someone to help. 
I had to move from my college appartement due to the virus with my BF and I haven’t been able to see him in a month and I’m falling back into a hole hard. 

I’ve started considering self harm, again after being clean for months. Every night I’ve been crying. Little things set me off into a spiral of self hatred. I feel so hopeless and alone. 

I feel absolute resentment for his mother. Who will let him go to the store and expose himself to the virus but not come visit me 10 minutes away. 

Talking on the phone doesn’t do anything and I’m so tired of people saying “just talk on the phone, just face time” that makes it WORSE! I need physical touch and smell. Without that it just feels wrong and I’m reminded that I CANT see him. That I had to miss his 21st birthday, that we are going to miss out 3 YEAR anniversary and my 20th birthday. 

I can’t get stuff done. I have so many online lectures building up and assignments and I have no motivation to do them. What’s the point? Who knows if I’ll even make it through quarantine because it likely will just keep getting extended. Suicidal thoughts keep creeping into my head along with feelings of absolute defeat. I can’t stand being at home with my broken family. I just want to stop being in the middle of my parents. I just want peace."
1,"I decided I would kill myself if I reached the age of 35 in the same lonliness.. 32M here with not much to say about my life. 

I never had a date or a girlfriend, at the end of the day that's what crushes me the most, everything I do, I do alone and it's just empty when I have no one to share things with. I can't even imagine what it feels like to be with someone you genuinely like. 

I followed the advice of using the time to do something with myself. We're not born with equal capabilities, I'm fit but I work a basic job and failed at getting an education. I wrote a lot but the end result is still quite garbage. I look at 32 years of life with nothing of value achieved. Neither professionally, nor socially, nor artistically.

And at the end of the road, a lonely life isn't worth living. I don't have much hope for things to change in such a short time, but at least I will now my best years are over and they were not worth it, so I'm not missing out by leaving sooner. 

I just needed to say it somewhere."
1,"Nostalgia is the primary fuel to my depression.. Anyone else? I'm 30 and currently in the worst mental state of my entire life. I've battled depression for 17 years, but nothing akin to this. These past few days are the first time in my life I've seriously considered ending my life. In the past I could always say I had thought about suicide, but it was never an imminent threat to my life. 

Nostalgia seems to be both a catalyst and a symptom of my depression. I can't stop thinking about my old life when i actually felt happiness. Playing outside with my friends, riding bikes, jumping on the trampoline. Just how connected we all were every day, everything felt so real. I can't stop my mind from constantly reminiscing on what my life once was, and the emptiness it is now. 

I never thought I would be someone who would post something like this. I suppose it's the overwhelming hopelessness I feel. I'm afraid of myself for the first time ever, the depression has completely engulfed my being. A healthy way out feels impossible..."

I just want a new place. I’m on a month to month. I just want a year lease.


Matter of fact, why can’t I get a nice place, under 1.3k? No I take that back, I can easily find a place cheap, but no one will let me get credit pass.


All I want is a year lease on someplace with a nice kitchen, decent backslash, clean carpet maybe two bedrooms. 

Nope, I can’t pass a credit check for my life.

OH and why do people turn their nose at my VA disability? Like yeah I don’t work, and I’ll probably be in the house all day everyday.

But as long as your paid, should that matter?



Nope, sorry we couldn’t approve your application.



LIKE BRO, I was paying 2.3k a MONTH just to sleep in a extended stay for a damn YEAR. Not by choice...2017/2018 ROUGH.


45$ fee every appointment just to write some info on piece of paper and I’m trying to tell these people ahead of time...HEY I have bad credit from when I was young and dumb in the military.  But no, take this fee and deny me.


I hate this apartment, but I was homeless at the time, and they said yes. Honestly they said NO, but the people at the Veterans Center got me in there. Nonetheless it was better than the streets.


Being a social outcast I have no references, err... I mean friends. 

No one to hook me up. 

I remember this one couple that looked at my VA verification letter like it was a fake... I'm like I drove here with disabled veteran plates, my ID says veteran, the freaking paper has a way to contact for proof...


I have apartment hunting trama from the level of pain and rejection I've felt. 


I wanted to run away to Puerto Rico. Well... I thought that would be cool but ya know...lockdown ect, but I don't even know Spanish so...yeah doubt that move.


I'm in abq, and all I want to do is find a NICE place to stay, I'll pay whatever (under 1.5k)
Realistically, idk I'd rather live in a rented uhual then this place... 


Idk, might be some errors and spelling or even format but I dont care... I seriously hate my position in life right now, and could careless if this seems legible or not...

1,"I just self harmed for the first time in 14 years.. I’m so ashamed of myself but I lost it. I lost my mind. I saw red. And all I could think was fuck everything and fuck everyone. 

My best friend suffered a tragedy beyond words in December. The father of her unborn child and her partner hung himself. She was 8 months pregnant and found him in their brand new house, had to take him down and give him
CPR While he died in her arms. It’s been traumatizing. I have had conversations with her that have been more heartbreaking than most things I’ve heard in life. 

Easter Sunday we’re all having a great morning and my sister brings up that she’d like to give my friend at $250 target gift card to help. My dad out of nowhere says “$250? That’s some bullshit.” Everyone was stunned. no one said anything until I spoke up and said “why is that bullshit? To help my best friend whose struggling really bad right now and is so depressed and sick that she is on short term disability bc she’s not ready to go back to work. Then to save face in front of everyone, he started to lie. Just straight lie and act like he had no idea who jasmine was (he’s met her several times she’s been my friend for over a decade) tried to act like he had no idea about the situation (completely lies. He knew everything about it. He was there when I went to the funeral and asked a bunch of questions and I cancelled a lot of things during this time to support her) and made me look like a crazy person for being upset.

Mind you- my dad and I have had a strained relationship for awhile. My husband and I have been living in my parents basement for a year to try to save and he has made servers really fucked up comments besides this one- called me a fucking asshole bc I questioned something he said Under his breath about me and yelled a berated me in front of my husband. Has been rude to my husband. Made snide remark after snide remark to the point where I’m completely anxious to even do upstairs or be around him bc he’s just mean. 

My mom and I have always been close. She didn’t say anything to him during this incident. And basically said to me after I got upset “shut up. I am trying to enjoy my Easter.” Okay yeah bc I wasn’t trying to enjoy my Easter right ? This morning I made an order at a wine store and she went off on me telling me that I haven’t asked her if she’s wanted anything from any stores when we’ve gone out and basically calling us selfish. Let me be clear- I’m about the least selfish person ever. And I forgot to ask 1 time. We have been out of the house maybe 5-6 times total and I sent her screen shots when I and my husband have asked her if she needed anything. I just couldn’t believe she has the nerve to call me selfish after all this had gone down and I haven’t heard a word from her or my dad about Sunday. No apologies. Nothing. 

So I lost it. Everything came to a head. I am in so much pain and have been for over a decade. I take meds daily. I see my psych and therapist regularly. I try so hard to better myself and be a good person, daughter, sister, wife everything and everyone just seems to want to shit on me. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know what I ever did to deserve this. I feel like I was born by mistake. My sisters never get shit. Literally never. My oldest sister can basically do no wrong- yet I’m supposed to be having a wedding in 5 months and she hasn’t done a damn thing or asked anything about it and she’s supposedly one of my maid of honors. 

I first took 6 of my pills and then cut my arm with my razor. Not too deep and not too near my veins. I am so ashamed of myself. It’s been a really really long time since I’ve done that. The pain I felt. Watching it bleed. It just made me
Want to keep going and brought back all
The trauma I’ve had in my life. All the pain I stuff down every day and have for years. I am in so much pain and still no one cares. I’m just the brunt of everyone’s bullshit. And all I can think about it wanting to end it all. I love my husband so much and my two cats but the pain is so deep that sometimes I don’t even think about how their lives would be effected if I died. And he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand the pain. 

I’ve bandaged my arm. 6 pills were not enough to do anything but make me really tired and numb to my emotions- I did email my doctor. 

I don’t know where to go from here. I just need a hug. I need someone to tell me that I’m not crazy and that I have a right to be upset and feel hurt. My feelings do matter. That my life is important. I tried to text my mom that I wanted to die and she basically got more mad at me and gave me an ultimatum to talk or not and then continued to say I was ridiculous for wanting to die bc she got mad at me about the grocery order. She knows good and well that was just the straw that broke the camels back in my current depression. 

Sorry for the ramble. I just needed to vent. I needed someone out there to here me. Someone to let me know it’ll be okay. 

TLDR: I self harmed for the first time in over 14 years and am ashamed of myself."
1,"Kept pushing it to the side but today i realized that actually i am a bit depressed. Today i was trying to make some bucks but just when i was about to start doing something i felt sad and discouraged. Imagine how awful it is to be hungry and want to eat, just for your body to run away from getting food and instead go and stay in a corner doing nothing. I cant do this by myself anymore. I need help but no one can give it to me because i am a legit burden and people dont deserve to deal with my shit. Dont talk me out of this, it is not going to work. When you see an abandoned kitten in the street you know you wont do shit if you just pet him. Instead you take him home and help him to flourish. I hate to admit it but i am so hopeless as that and altho i internaly cringe at the idea, i know it is the truth.

I will never be worth anything ever. I am damaged and if i do a recovery of sorts, i will carry the scars of this forever."
1,"Motivation.. 19 in my second year of college, although I've only passed one semester of the four I've taken and had to withdraw from the rest. Went to the doctor after my first year here and they told me I had Severe Seasonal depression. It seemed to only affect me during the winter, but this year it seems like its still hanging on, and I've lost all motivation. I walked out of my job of 2 years, stopped pursuing hobbies I've loved since middle school, and now will be my last semester in college before I have no choice but to drop out (Lost all financial aid and can't afford). I'm currently on 20mg Fluoxetine (10 wasn't enough) and I'm starting to feel completely worthless. The only thing I have going for me is that I still live with my mom, but all i can find happiness in doing is playing video games. Even with the current events and circumstances, I can't make myself get out of bed to work on online homework. I struggle everyday of my life to find motivation to do anything, and I don't know what to do anymore. Starting to feel like nobody needs me here. If you have any advice on what keeps you motivated and what makes you get out of bed everyday, please share. Thanks for reading if you made it to the end."

1,Constantly thinking about dying. I'm always in the constant reminder that how much would it be better if i got into an accident and died. I always fantasize about dying. Honestly i dont even care if i die of the coronavirus bc i dont want to live in this fucking world. I'd be more than happy to die. The only reason i'm alive is because of my family. I know how much it would hurt them when they find out im dead. If only i could erase myself from everyone's memory then i would be able to die without any regrets.
1,"Well I don’t have anyone to talk to so I’ll post on here... (excuse the bad punctuation and grammar). I woke up just 20 minutes ago... it’s 1:49pm... I feel like a jobless fat piece of shit. My lack of motivation caused me to gain 50+ pounds... i get stupidly upset when I find porn on my bfs computer and than after I get done crying I realize how fucking stupid I’m acting and than I get pissed at myself smoke a cigarette and procrastinate when it comes to looking for a job. I know that I’m not helping myself but I just feel like I really don’t give a fuck if I sink in life or not I already want to kill myself . Usually I’m pretty keyed up and emotional but today I feel nothing but anger and nothing at the same time. I’m kinda a hypocrite, I lie and I feel like a bad person.. I feel like if there was a heaven or hell I’d definitely be going to hell at this point I have no one in my life and my boyfriend and his family are the only ones that care about me but they don’t even know he’s my boyfriend lol we’ve kept it a fucking secret for 2 years and honestly idk how to feel about that... my life is a mess and I’m only 18 at this point I survive on weed cigarettes tea diet pills and sleep I really want to die but like all of me and my fellow pussies I’m kinda scared....if you can’t tell I’m balls deep in my depression. I cut almost all my hair off the other day with scissors (short like a pixie) and I feel like I’m really ugly but people tell me I’m very pretty and all it does is piss me off because I feel like I’m disgusting... I’m a sex addict. I’m pretty sure I deal with a lot of shit for someone who is only an 18 year old girl but that would take a novel just to explain. I feel like everything I have to deal with on a daily basis has driven me to insanity I used to be pretty happy but when I turned 16 I was moved from house to house for 2 years and counting. I’m a piece of shit haha and honestly I feel like if I was to lose the weight get a job and have my own apartment I’d feel good again... but right now that seems like fantasy land for me well idk where I was even going with this but yeah that’s me :l"
1,"Depression. Moments of joy are cut short by it, the sudden boosts of confidence and hope don't come around often anymore. If they come, they last a breath. My overthinking has become a huge problem, so instead of savoring moments I let them pass by because my mind is occupied with many thoughts, some of which will never happen. It makes me sleep bad if it lets me sleep at all. I wake up mad because I am alive, knowing the privilege but more than willing to pass it onto someone else."
1,"It was my birthday today (apologies for bad English). Birthday is the worst day of my life. Every birthday I'm reminded that I don't matter much in anyone's life.
Today was my 19th birthday. Those of my friends who I thought would wish me in the first place, didn't even remember the date. And others who wished knew only because I had told them quite recently.  
Though it's not the first time I have felt extremely alone, even then I feel sad. Maybe it's my fault too, to expect so much of a birthday wish from others. I kept checking my phone after every 2 minutes if anyone had even got a facebook reminder. 

I just don't understand why am I different from others. Other people get wished even weeks before their bday. What would they lose in just remembering a date, 15 April.
Why is it that I don't get the same amount of happiness as others get. I have never even hurt anyone. 
I know this isn't the last time I have felt like a loser. I will get the same feeling sometime later again. 

I just don't want to get reminded the same fact again and again."
1,Hi. Hi I didn’t know where else to go my gf suffers from depression and is going getting help. She’s going to a mental hospital/clinic idk how to call it. I’m happy she’s getting help but it’s hard for me not being able to help her I know there’s no way I can help her or understand but it still hurt. She leaves in a couple days to stay in the hospital for a month and it’s difficult I feel like she feels alone and that I’m mad at her for going I’m not it’s just hard to be separated from her for so long. She’s my best friend and I want her to get help. Is there anything I can do to let her know I support her in her decision to get help even if I’m sad at the same time?
1,"We should open everything back up. I hate Trump...but I agree with him that we should open up the country. I need to make my life better and I am growing bitter and angry at seeing people laughing and posting their dumb photos and fake concerns. I don’t care anymore-why should I care for a country...a society that sees me as a loser? Why should I care for a country that ignores me? Either way, global warming will still end humanity us all so we might as well get on with it. Sick and tired of people posting these cheery fake videos of qUAreNTinED and having a “hard” time inside their fucking houses. I get why people voted Trump-they want it to all burn. I’m jealous and hateful of everyone and everything and there’s no hope for me. I can never be normal."
1,"I'm an asshole, and want to either be alone or just die. I have a wife and 2 small kids, and I regularly on a daily basis want nothing to do with them.

I dont want to play or interact with the kids. I just dont care. I want to care... but my brain doesn't care.

I dont care about my wife anymore. The love I had when marrying her is long gone.

I dont want to do the enormous pile of dish washer loading and unloading 4 times a day because she keeps eating and never cleaning up afterwards.

I dont want to empty and hang up clothes and load the washer twice a day because they keep making a mess.

What I want is to either be totally separated from them and just pay the child support for 18 years, and completely independent and on my own.

I miss the days where I could wake up on a day off whenever the fuck I wanted to. I could game for hours on end and have fun with buddies online.

I used to go out to bars with work buddies or my entire work department and have a great time after a week of work, chat up the ladies, just enjoy life.

I fucking hate being at home. I look forward to work every single day now. I'd rather be there working and away from my family.

But on the flip side.. I feel an insane amount of guilt and anger with myself for feeling like this. It would be a lot easier to just fucking kill myself.

I most of the time rather be dead than do the separation option because Its selfish and awful of any man to do that to someone and still be alive living their life while the ex wife does all the heavy lifting alone knowing that her partner just up and left and didn't give a shit.

At least if I'm dead she can take out her anger on the fact that at least I'm dead and not out there living, which would make her feel worse.

I'm so fucking tired... tired of the hallucinations, the meds that dont work, regularly overdosing my meds trying to get them to work cos I cant see a shrink anymore thanks to covid, waking up feeling like I've been bashed in the face with a hammer every day while my daughter is yanking my arm to get up and do boring shit like play with fucking toys I could not give 2 shits about, watching crappy cartoons on repeat, making her food and then she barely eats any of it so what's the fucking point, all while trying to stand up with a head that feels like it's been blown off.

I'm tired of everyone. I'm tired of my dickhole parents always trying to keep in contact when I've made it clear I dont wanna know them anymore. I'm tired of hearing that the distant family members are sending me messages to say hi when I haven't spoken to them for years since they traumatised me and fucked me over.

I'm tired of trying to get in touch with another friend who regularly thinks of ending his life and trying to calm him down, tired of trying to keep in touch with childhood buddies who just up and abandoned talking to me when I moved.

FUCKING TIRED. I just wanna live like Jimmy in the Wire. Shithole apartment with one room and a mattress on the floor and my smartphone and maybe a TV. Bag of clothes in the corner. Eat when I'm out. Drink lots. Smoke weed or do some drugs. Go to titty bars, and if I cant do that.... fuck it, I'm jumping. Everyone in the world... humanity... go fuck yourself.

Shit species. Always consuming and multiplying and spreading everywhere when theres nothing left to consume. Just like a fucking virus. Fuck humanity."
1,How do u find ur mind?. I swear I just don’t know anymore. Y do I feel like this? So lost so empty. Y me? How come everyone who I look at just seems to be living better then me? I feel stuck between the world with no escape. I want to die but don’t want to kill my self. Please can I go to sleep a never wake up PLEASE I don’t feel like I belong in this world. Everything about screams I shouldn’t be here. How did I get to this? This point of no faith. No matter what I try it just seems as there’s no luck for me. Y should I keep fighting when there no end to this war this pain I’m so tired I just want to sleep. Is that too much to ask for? I hate it here. I hate my self I hate the world I hate how unfair my life has been while I see others who just look as god has touched them. Do I have a purpose? Maybe my purpose is to die maybe that’s the answer maybe it’s all I’ve been looking for. The answer to my peace
1,"It feels like the universe hates me. I'm genuinely scared of what's going to happen next because everything has gone so wrong.

First, I live in New York, and my town got infected way before many other places

Next, online school is super difficult for me because of my depression anxiety and add (diagnosed btw). I'm in eighth grade so it shouldn't be that big of a deal even if I failed, but Im taking 3 highschool courses and I might have to retake all of them next year, and I'm fucking freaking out.

I'm also stuck in the house with my parents who will never get off my back.

And to top it all off, my best friend says she doesn't know if she wants to be friends anymore and nothing even feels real.

Sometimes I just like to say that everyone's just pulling a big prank on me and everything is okay. It's really the only thing that would calm me down. I really hope this stuff will make me delusional or insane so I don't have to deal with this anymore."
1,"i could really use something to numb the pain right now. my grandma passed away, my depression and eating disorder just increased significantly, really trying hard to find the will to live. my SO and I aren’t on good terms as of this moment. I am feeling for the people who are struggling at this moment and i feel helpless and hopeless that there isn’t something i could do about it. I numbed everything in me but it’s slowly building up. i wish i had drugs on hand to numb the pain. even for a slight second."
1,"I can't take this shit anymore in getting worse everyday. No matter how much i try to feel positive, try to distract my self i just can't get better. I cry all the time, i become angry at small things. I just want to die i will never get better never fuck my life plz kill me plz I feel like a loser i can't sleep  i can't function like a normal human. The only thing i do is just cry cry cry and cry im sick of living this pathetic life i hope i die soon"
1,"Daily happy time. Everyday of this journey is painful and hard, ot makes me more than tired and i don't know what to do to get out of it. BUT, everyday, i have this moment of the day where nothing matters, the night falls and everything seems cool, all the stuffs i was fearing about during the day just seems to fly out and I can just smile and talk to people. 

Just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this or smthing close to it !

I KNOW WE WILL OVERCOME THIS, BYE"
1,Therapy appointment was cancelled today.. I've been using the betterhelp app for the past week and had a session scheduled for today but I couldn't afford to pay for another week so now I can't talk to her. I haven't had a therapist in almost a year amd I desperately need someone to talk to. I've just been crying and drinking all morning.
1,"I'm plunging into depression again as I'm very tired with work and everything but I don't have anyone to talk to.. So tired I just wanna cry. I try to keep myself from falling throughout the day. One may see me as prolly the strongest person in a work environment. But after it's over, I just wanna break down. So tired. What's the point of working anymore. I once thought it was to fullfil my desire to do what I love. Now it's just child's play for a handsome paycheck. It's meaningless. I'm just so lonely. Work, study, lift, eat, sleep. I just wish I had someone. So hard. so sad"
1,"What have I become?. What am I even doing anymore? Why am I still here? I never belonged here. Some people aren’t meant for life. I tried for a good while, it just was wasn’t enough. I think I’m done. I’m not even in control of myself anymore. If I do this, it will be me taking control. I’ll be making a decision I want to make. The darkness won’t hold me back anymore. Maybe I’ll catch a glimpse of myself before I go. I haven’t seen him in so long. I don’t know what he looks like anymore. I’ve scarred and mutilated my body and my mind. I’m tired of doing this to myself. I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired and I think I’m ready to move on. 

I don’t know what else to do.
I’m so tired
I just want to rest

I’ll just go to sleep and everything will be okay, right?

This is me reaching out I guess. Looking for a reason to keep fighting, to keep going. Give me a reason please. I don’t want to die, I just can’t live like this anymore."
1,"Coronavirus has brought me to my breaking point. I'm in Ontario. I know location doesn't matter too much. I'm also considered an essential service. I do laptop repair for a major manufacturer. We support many other essential workers, so we're more backline, out of sight workers. Still essential.

I'm also an introvert. I do okay in large groups, but I prefer gatherings of less than 10. Even that has been taken away. I can't do my regular dinners with my mom, or my sister. My dad wasn't able to visit for Easter. I'm just stuck at work, or stuck in the damn house and I'm getting sick of it. I've had depression as long as I remember, I was diagnosed last year. I was doing so well. I've never done any type of visible self harm, though I've had addictions. Suicidal thoughts were a normal occurrence in my life, though I never made any attempts at my own life.

I was starting to get so much better. I was taking my medication. Thoughts of ending my life were not as prevalent in my mind. I was enjoying life. Enjoying spending time with loved ones. My wife and new son. Now I dread every moment. I'm worn out and there's no way for me to recharge. I hardly sleep. I'm at my breaking point and if something doesn't change I'm afraid of what I might do. Self harm is off the table but for how long? How much longer can I go on like this?

There's not really any point to this post. I just need to air out my thoughts somewhere anonymous."
1,"Can't understand normal people thinking. When I see people suffer, I feel pain too. Even in the very serious pandemic right now, how can some people don't care and  being ignorance to the suffers? How can they keep enjoy life when terrible thing happening from the outside world?"
1,Cannabis helps and also does not help me.. Sometimes it's exactly what I need and then sometimes it gives my the worst anxiety and depression. Anyone else get this?
1,"is narcissism the root of it all. i don't like myself. i don't like the way i have lived my life. i don't like how i've treated others. i feel like i have lived a life of lies. just want to disintegrate. 

I don't like myself as a person and I don't want to make myself better."
1,"I don't really know if I'm depressed. ***Really long I know. Sorry about that.

I've always been an optimist, all my life I've always tried to look for the bright side of things. And it's the same way now, sometimes I convince myself. But then there is days like these where everything comes crashing down, and I remember how I was bullied by everyone. And how I always felt like shit, I remember all the ""friends"" I used to have that would call me ugly and ignore everything I did, and just laughed at my face. I remember my ex and the abuse I went from her and how no one supported me, ever.

But I don't want to be depressed, I know I sound like an asshole but I think suicide is about the dumbest thing you can ever commit. Why kill yourself when your already gonna die? Why not live life to the fullest and let death come naturally? 

But even though I have those thoughts there is always that other voice in my head. A voice that you can barely hear, you'd have to really listen to be able to hear it. It keeps telling me to kill myself over and over again it says, what's the point in being alive when no one likes you, when all your friends hate you. Your a nobody, stop being alive.

On most days I can barely hear the voice I ignore it, but then there is those days where I wake up and cry and it's like the voice had climbed over the thousands of walls I've put up and its shot the thousands of little guards that I call rational thought. And it's THERE, it's taken over everything.

But I'm still a little strong I can pin that thought down and throw it back to the back of my mind. But it's words still haunt me.

So yeah I don't know if I'm depressed, I don't want to be depressed, I was scared to post on this subreddit because other depressed people scare me. They really do, talks about suicide scare me. Like a real talk on it, the nitty gritty of suicide, cutting, tying a noose all that. It scares me.

Maybe it's because every time I open this subreddit I'm looking at who I really am."
1,"Nobody cares about anything anymore.. I am sad. Sad is me. 

Am I the only one that feels like this life in all aspects is turning to complete shit before our eyes? 

Everywhere you look life is shit. And nobody seems to care. I feel like dying. How can I die? 

It’s just gonna get more and more fucked up. I have no hope for anything any more. 

What can I do to be happy? How do happy people do it? I guess they have a life. That must help. Stuff like an SO and friends probably helps keep you sane. I don’t have that.

I am alone and I’ve been alone. Every time I try to not be alone I seem to just make it worse. Nobody calls. Nobody texts. Nobody wants to know me. 

They don’t want to be with a depressed person. Nobody likes depressed people. We should all just die. I should die. The non depressed people would have easier lives without me around trying to sponge their happiness.

How can I die? I wish I knew some easy way. I really want it. I’ve wanted that for years. Decades. But I don’t know what to do. It’s one thing to think but another to actually do.

I know it just gets worse. Constantly. More and more people turn out to be assholes. More tragic awfulness in the world seems destined. Nobody cares about anyone or anything anymore."
1,"I started self harming again. Well, I never really *stopped* harming myself.

I used to cut my wrists and thighs, but I stopped doing that four or five years ago. Until today.

When I stopped cutting, I did other things. I hit myself, scratched myself, burned myself. I always had to have something. I get these attacks of blind rage where I just have to hurt *something*, but I don’t want to hurt other people, so I usually end up hurting myself. When I do, I feel sort of satisfied with it. I’m not as angry anymore.

I used to have a pretty bad problem with cutting which is why I stopped for so long, but today, other methods of hurting myself just wasn’t working.

I want help. I really do. I don’t want to live out the rest of my life hurting myself and contemplating suicide nearly every day. There are just so many more lows than there are highs for me. But there’s nothing I can do. I clearly can’t help myself. It’s been eight years of genuinely trying to get better, to no avail.

But I can’t get help. either. My insurance doesn’t cover therapy. The only therapist I could see would be the one on my college campus, but with the pandemic and summer coming up, that’s out of the question now.

I’ve really thought about admitting myself to a mental hospital because I am scared that one day, I’ll go too far. I don’t think rationally when I want to hurt myself. There’s one nearby that I’ve looked into, but again, my insurance wouldn’t cover it, and neither I or my family have that kind of money.

I feel hopeless. Angry, scared, and hopeless."
1,"Feeling really alone and down today. I'm feeling really down today. Very lonely, in fact. I recently went through some heartbreak and it's still lingering. I'm having a hard time letting it go, and letting this person go for that matter. On top of that, there's been a lot of stress at work, which has usually been a place that I've been able to find stability and at least some predictability. 

My feelings of self worth are really low right now. I don't think I'll ever be loved again like this person loved me, and when I have (sporadic) communication with this person it feels so cold and distant. 

I hate myself for not being able to let go - for still caring so much about this person and not being able to undo that. 

I hate myself for not being able to get out of this rut. 

I've seen a psychiatrist and I'm not showing enough of the symptoms to go on medication but I definitely have some elements of depressive disorder. 

A lot if it is because my life really feels like it's in the shitter right now and no one cares."
1,"My father was more ""overtly"" abusive to me, yet the thought of my mom, who escaped from him with me, finally realising MY pain after I'm gone is what brings me pleasure.. ~~We ran away~~  He kicked us out a decade ago, when I was 9, after witnessing horrible acts of physical, sexual and emotional abuse by his hands both to my mom and me (not sexual, that happened at the hands of other family members later)  for many years, pretty much since I was born.

Yet my mom and the rest of my family have always forced me to act like she was my saviour. No one likes it when I as much as try to bring up the fact that she was the one who cheated on him, she was the one who regularly left me alone with him, knowing full well he was making my life living hell.

When we left, that should've been the end of the pain. Not the ramp up; the part where the guitars start properly chugging and the LPFs are released.

And then she left. I was barely 13. She left to move to another city, because she wanted to live her life unbound by me. She wanted to date rich European men and hoe around. And that came at the cost of me being forced to spend the next 5-6 years of my life with my piece of shit paternal grandparents. Those who made clear that I was just a burden left on them unjustly.

All of this is a tiny, tiny, tiny part of my story, but it bears mentioning/ranting. I still fantasise about ripping and tearing my dad, sure, but no matter what I still have nothing but resentment for my mom. And considering I'll never be in a romantic relationship (not by choice), therapy and medication simply never worked for me in the 5 years I did try it, and emotionally fulfilling friendships over the web only go so far... There's really nothing left. Is there?

Maybe I'm the real villain here, and I just need to shut up. My suicide note will probably not even mention any of this considering how much more it hurts that I'll never ever have anyone who'll love me. Who'll show me what love is like when no one else did. Don't you dare tell me to love myself don't you fucking dare."
1,"Everyone i used to know and love (my besties and my just friends) Hate me now.. It all started with someone homophobic, my friend shipped me with him and im gay so.. Anyways, she went apeshit about how it was my fault and how i was screaming over it even though i was just getting    
super angry, so then he gets mad and now i have 2 mad at me, fast forward its 4 now because im starting to get meaner, i calm down and 2 like me again, then BAM one day i made a joke about myself and someone comments a horribly rude comment on it, then it starts this whole thing and now only 2 people like me, my sister and my best friend. how do i stop this. how do i gain their trust again.. Someone help, i feel like starving myself and cutting."
1,"Why do I hate this. I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they aren't physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I'm in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I'm 6'2"", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I'm so fucking depressed.
I told my parents that I haven't been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.
I only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.
I drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I'm actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.

Please if you're not actually depressed don't say you are it's people like that that make me not come forward and people that don't recognize depression as a real condition"
1,I ran out of antidepressants and it just made me... angry? Wtf. Biocitalopram or something. Lockdown means I can't get more currently so just yeah.
1,Why do you hide your feelings from your loved one (for those who do)?. I do it because I absolutely hate discussing my feelings.  It takes too much emotional effort
1,"I'm so fed up with being told to ""just don't feel the way you do"" or ""just feel this other way instead"". Every fucking self help bullshit starts with ""Just stop saying self talk and just start self affirming yourself."" 

It all amounts to ""Just don't have all the issues you have, and instead have no issues!""

Wow thanks I'm cured, it was that easy all a fucking long. Thanks. Why didn't I think of that???????????"
1,How do I tell my parents I have depression and want help?. I just don’t know how to bring it up. Thanks for any advice.
1,"Does anybody else feel misunderstood?. I'm just kind of venting here but I'm also curious to see if anyone can relate.

There's this friend that I have that I talk to quite often online through discord, and we're pretty close. But I always dread talking to her because of how she treats me. It's near impossible to get my point across on anything without her interrupting or changing the subject. Whenever I say something to intend one thing, she'll take it as another thing (if that makes sense) and she'll usually try to always one-up me in our conversations. Last night she talked about a little of what she struggles with, and I was there for her to comfort/support her. But when I tried to bring up myself and open myself to her, she ignored me and shot it down. She does say she hopes I can find peace or whatever, but she won't ever allow me to be myself with her (which would be really helpful) and when she talks to me, it's like she completely ignores what I tired to say. She can't ever seem to understand me when I try to talk to her, and I really want her to. And I **always** feel worse after every conversation we have.

But can any of you guys relate? Like you try your best to explain your situation to someone, and they say they're sorry or they get it. But when they try to help or give advice, it's in a completely different direction.

Or something like this."

\----------------------

I just don't want to live. No one understands that, everyone keeps telling me shit that my life is just about to start. Like saying that my problems maybe doesn't matter because I'm young (18). I'm scared that life may be even worse than today. I've been suffering from depression for a really long time (I stopped being happy when I was 4th grade, wanted to kill myself since 6th grade). Everyone in my primary school was bullying me and telling me stuff I'm ugly, weird and sometimes they were throwing stuff at me. There was once a boy that kept kicking my legs but I don't remember exactly why. When I graduated from this school to another, the bullying just didn't stop. They were bullying me because I was poor and my family had financial problems. When I moved to another town I had strong trust issues but everything was fine. I felt like everything is about to change to better.

But it didn't.

I found my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were with each other for almost 2 years. I felt loved and I would do then everything for him just to feel loved. I was very jealous of him. Something like yandere tbh but I don't think so, I just wanted to be with him forever and show everyone that I can be in relationship (I remember when one of girls from my class in primary school told me that I'm so ugly and disgusting that even a pedophile wouldn't touch me). So I did. Until he started insulting me in a very vulgar way but mostly he called me ""a fucking ameba"". He also started to be nice to me but only when we had sex. I couldn't satisfy him when I tried to pleasure him. He was also trying to flirt with my lesbian acquaintance. In front of me. Many times. I didn't want to end this relationship because I thought that I will never find a partner again and I will be forever alone. But I finally decided after all this long time of pain. I told him to fuck off. I cried for a long time but for now I just feel disgusting that a person like him has touched my body. No worries, he never raped me nor molested me. I just feel bad that someone like him touched me.

After some months I went to the mental hospital because I was feeling really suicidal. I've been here for about 3 weeks. People were bullying me there because I was annoying to them and one girl even told me that I should just kill myself and everyone will be happy. They were laughing at me because ""I couldn't handle the truth"". My mom took me out from there even though my doc wanted to keep me for two weeks more. Yes, she knew what was happening to me during my stay in this stupid hospital.

When I was there someone from my classmate's discord told me they can keep me company during this hard time. It was my future boyfriend. We were with each other for some months. He broke up with me because he felt that he has feels for a girl that he knew for a long time. I felt sad but he never hurt me, so I decided just to let him go. I didn't want to be annoying or something.

And now we're here. Me, depressed and bored, who doesn't want to get better because I know it won't work. It never worked. And this coronavirus stuff is making me even more depressed. I wanna die but something from this virus just bugs me. I'm just... lost, ugh. Everything pisses me off."
1,"Life wasn’t meant for me. Life just wasn’t meant for me. I’m unable to live up to the standards society has placed on me. As a 22 year old male, there is obviously a lot of them. Want examples? Ok. I’m expected to be tough and never show emotions, can’t do that. I’m expected to know a lot about cars and tools and all that, I don’t know any of that. In relationships, I’m expected to “be a man” and provide for women, make all the first moves, chase after scary sounds and bugs, do heavy lifting, provide for her while she just gets to be comfortable, I definitely can’t do any of that. I’ve never even been in a relationship, as someone with high functioning autism/aspergers, dating is pretty much rigged against me, so is society as a whole really. Women are cared about and have all these people fighting for them, I wish I had people fighting for me, I matter to nobody. Women are always cared about when depressed but males are just told to man up and deal with it. I’ve always wished I was a girl. If some of that sounds sexist I really don’t care, it wasn’t, and if that’s how you took it that’s too bad. I don’t have the strength, mentally and emotionally to live up to these standards, never can, and I never plan to. Already planning to kill myself soon, I’m beginning to overcome my fear of death and by the end of the year I likely will. Life clearly wasn’t meant for me, and I don’t plan to stick around, especially in a world that hates me. 

I know this is gonna be ignored, but I don’t give a shit at this point, I need I vent whether you all like it or not. It just proves my point about how I don’t matter."
1,"Goodbye to the people I was happy to know. I love and miss you guys, I wish the four of you wanted to talk to me again. I leave and end this world alone but free of pain of grief and sadness. I’ll never hold anger towards you like you feel towards me, I’m glad I met you Z** and thank you for being a part of my life. I’m sorry things have to end this way, I love you like my closest friends and hope you the best"
1,help me.  I am 19. I have been feeling depressed for long stretches at a time and every once in a while I will feel fine but I go back down seemingly out of nowhere and I am depressed for what feels like forever. I live with my parents and I don't like talking to them about my issues because they just tell me I am complaining. I don't have my own doctor and with this COVID it's not like I can go anywhere to seek help. I feel stuck and I don't want this anymore
1,Finding comfort in your depression?. So I’ve been going to a therapist and a doctor for almost 1 1/2 years now and I feel like I haven’t made much progress aside from understanding myself better. On December my doctor prescribed Adderal to me for my depression and ADHD and it was pretty good in keeping me focused and being happy I guess. But I stopped taking it after like a week. I haven’t taken any medication or visited my therapist since. Mainly because I swore I was finally gonna go back to college but never did. I was too ashamed to go back showing I had barely any progress. Plus I stopped taking medication. I know it would help me greatly but for some reason I just don’t want to get into that funk of feeling good and I’m not sure why. Is it because I simply am to attached to being depressed? It sucks because I feel like people that start therapy and all that start making noticeable changes in only a couple months and I haven’t done jack in almost two years. Like no progress and when the solution is right in my drawer(medication)  I don’t want it. I just need a better understanding of all this.
1,"Well. Back to starving myself.. I have always felt like I take up more than I deserve. I haven't eaten in 3 daya.

I wish it didn't feel so right. I take up so many resources and I can't work so why should I eat?"
1,I don’t know why I’m still here. Honestly at this point I’m not living my life for me . I’ve excepted the fact I’ll never be truly happy . So I’m just living my life to make others happy. Even if it hurts me .
1,A little bit of my story not full detail. Since I was 15  I have been fighting depression for the last 6 years after my mum sadly passed away I became badly depressed and down a few days after she past when it all sank in and then I started to have flash backs from that day when she passed and I starting to go to see a therapist and they asked me what I saw with the flash backs and I could not tell then but I remember being sat there drawing and then he said to me if you like drawing maybe you should draw me what you see I remember drawing my mum laid in a hospital bed with our whole family around the bad and in give him it and he kinda just sat there and did not say anything I ran out crying and went to find my dad in my local town lucky enough he was not to far away from where i was and I never really went to a therapist after that for a few years because I could not trust them and I started self harming really badly and after about 4 years of harming my self in many different ways I found a therapist that was amazing he actually listened to what i have to say and then he would say things back to me that actually made sense and here I am today where things went down hill for the most part had the worse brake down ibhave ever had I was sat there in my room just playing with my blades wanting to cut and out of nowhere my dad came in and saw them and I looked at him as he was about to walk out and I said stay a minute please and put the blades into the box I had been hiding them and I just said take this bin it it's my blades I dont need them anymore I came this for so just take them and get rid of them and I feel like today has been a massive turning point for me and I just want say to everybody in this feed YOU CAN OVER COME THIS JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF. STAY STRONG. Thank you for your time reddit
1,"I have not yet met or read about anyone with the same kind of depression I have. Can you please share your experiences if they're similar?. Background: I'm 25. I've had (diagnosed) anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. It was not triggered by anything bad in my life, stress, or negative attitude. It was sudden. It's been theorized by some doctors that it's due to one of the many concussions I've had over my lifetime. I've tried everything from behavioral therapy and therapy sessions to almost every class of antidepressant. Yes, exercising and eating healthy too, etc. I've settled on one medication that's been the best so far. 

&#x200B;

Therapy helped for a while, but I haven't been able to find a replacement therapist that has helped. Therapy only helped me deal with the problems caused by my depression, not my depression itself.

&#x200B;

At my best, I'm a little anxious and somewhat normal, but never completely ""normal"". This is the case for 2 to 4 weeks. I then get a bout of depression that lasts 1 to 2 weeks. It is unprovoked and nothing seems to delay or prevent it, even regular exercise and healthy habits. I cannot stop it. My life is a cycle of several ""okay to good"" weeks followed by a couple of really low weeks. I tried self-medicating with marijuana for a while. It puts a damper on the tough weeks but doesn't help me continue living normally. I stopped using it.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else suffer from a similar type of depression? I cannot tell if it's major, persistent, manic, or atypical, and I frankly don't care that much to label it. I just have never spoken to anyone with a similar pattern. Please let me know if you experience this too."
1,"Zero motivation to learn anything new. I've come to the realization that I don't want to better myself if it involves teaching myself. I hate learning that way and it's not as effective as having a mentor or teacher present. 

I'm in the marketing field and it's very ""never stop learning"" and "" you should be using the quarantine to create a new side hustle or get a new skill"". I have zero motivation to further my learning even when there's no quarantine. I want to move up in my career but without a teacher, mentor, or even someone else in my field that I can go to, it's near impossible. 

I literally need someone to walk me through things, which people might see as hand-holding. I'm aware that people can't just walk me through life, but there's gotta be some kind of solution

I don't know anyone else who feels like this so is this normal? I WANT to want to learn, but straight up I do not want to learn a new skill. I know it will get me further in my career and my life, but I just can't bring myself to care.

I'm on antidepressants and they've worked wonders for me the past year, but I can't get past this hurdle. It's starting to affect my job and such. Any advice is appreciated!"
1,"What is depression. As someone who is depressed my opinion is that depression is just being repeatedly sad day after day due to lack of endorphines due to lack of anything for example if i suddenly met a girl (and ive never been in a relationship) that i liked i would get a natural release of endorphines causing me to feel good, do you think i would feel depressed at that moment? Then if that girl became my partner and i spent time with her every day i would get a release of endorphines so i wouldnt be depressed at those times, enough endorphine released could keep you feeling stable or happy for a few hours without any activity(i think), isnt it wrong for depression to be diagnosed and treated like a mental illness?"
1,"Today my therapist asked me if I think I'm in danger of hurting myself. I've been suffering from recurrent depression for years and have been seeing a therapist for about four months now, as I was no longer able to handle it myself. 

It's been bad before, but I think I've hit an all-time low  during the past weeks. Social and financial insecurity keep eating away at me, pressure from all sides to perform is crushing every will to go on, recent failures on search for jobs diminish every last bit of self-esteem and not being able to socialize during a damned pandemic takes away all my coping mechanisms. And finally, not having had a SO other to catch me for more than 7 years leaves me be lonely when times are toughest. Like that, I've been dragging myself from appointment to appointment with my therapist for the past weeks.

Yesterday, I burst into tears several times during the day, as I found myself reaching my limits. I wrote down all my thoughts and fealings to show my therapist today. 

After reading, he asked me if it would be possible that I'd end up hurting myself, or possibly worse, in my current situation. 

I've been thinking about this before, but never with any intent. My pride would never allow me to take that step. Also, I value myself and my life way too much to consider suicide. I'd rather have everything else go to shit and leave all things behind.

However, being asked this question left me scared with the need to tell someone."
1,Dissoation. My alters have been out way more recently and I’m scared. I feel like like I’m fading and I don’t know what to do.
1,"This system is a lie. Honorable grades through my high school, highest average grade at university's first year (out of ~400ppl). Picked absolutely wrong major though, tried another one, didn't work out too. Had absolutely no motivation, but finished first one (from best average grade to one of the worst on last semester), started msc in another field (IT).   Now I'm 24 and feel like I'm years behind my peers. Struggling to find a first professional job, missing deadlines all the time. From the person that usually didnt give a fuck bcs felt like I can do anything if I want, to the person having suicidal thoughts. I'm wrong perfectionist and it kills me and even doesn't let to accept possibility of failure. Everyone's telling you get a good grades, go to good university, have a well paid job and live happy. Well its all nice and actually easy to live up to this standard until you realise that this kind of living is worth shit just before the end of the road. I'm not that smart, more of hard-working type, and as I said, my life tailored me to be perfectionist who can't imagine failure, but I know I ended up pretty bad right now. I don't even know if I want to still pursue my actual field. Missing another recruitment deadline already bcs I'm unable to get going because I'm so tired of all the pressure,  need of catching up and skills improving all the time. I have been always more of artsy and sensitive type, tried alot of that stuff, but always stuck with ""real stuff"" in the end -came from the background of ""only hard work can make you a living"".  Don't go that road ppl. Do what you feel, not what ""people say"". These feelings have been rising in me for the last 4 years, now I'm drained and actually want to leave all of this including this world.

Feel like I've absolutely wasted my like last 10 years on trying to be the best at something (what wasn't that hard to achieve), and realized it was all just for the confidence boost. I'm basically nothing right now. Just sarcastic, bitter person at probably the best years of my life, feeling 10 years older already, and left with no power, nor resource to improve."
1,"Been a long time since I was back here. It feels like I've been lying to myself. You know, one second you're sitting at home, happy for your college getting suspended for the longest time, and the next second you're empty for no reason. I've had the dark, depressing corners of my brain take hold of me many times in these past few months, but this is...worse. It's been long since I felt truly alone and hollow after being surrounded with absolutely everything I want. It's weird, I feel like my mind is retching and howling and all I have to show for it is an unenthusiastic face and drooping eyes. Got a laugh out of me. Still amuses me. I feel the eyes of my parents on me. They're the sweetest, and yet I can't help but think they're disgusted by me. They're not, I know they're not, and yet the only thing I felt today was a strong urge to apologise for existing.

Well, fucked here or fucked there. At least I'm at home without work to do. I thought things would get better if I was in a better place during the quarantine... Eh. Bring it on, world."

1,"I am messing up everything in my life and I can't talk to anyone about it..  I am a 17 year old boy living in India and I am having a tough time living. A little background check - I am from an upper-middle class family, we live a decent life. The past 2 years have been very hard on me and I feel like 2020 is going to be even worse. I constantly fight with my parents for petty reasons and then I cry about it at night, I shout at them, and then regret it later. 2019 was a bad year, initially, till mid May, I was suicidal, I even put a blade to my wrist but somehow I stopped myself. I found a girl, the kindest, most beautiful girl ever, and I fell in love. But as the title suggests, I messed it up. I fell in love with her, she fell in love with me too, but I had a female friend with whom I was a little too flirtatious. Even though me and my girlfriend (who is also depressed and used to cut herself often and is now on medication) weren't dating at that moment, I had the FUCKING audacity to talk the other girl as if I liked her. That made my girlfriend hurt herself. Me and my girlfriend, we were making out and immediately after that, I described a sex dream about the friend, WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT, I TOLD HER THAT I WOKE UP WITH A BONER???? Even after all this, my girlfriend stayed with me, and then she told me that she wants me to not talk to that friend BUT I SAID NO I WILL NOT STOP TALKING TO HER, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I SAID NO. Then my girlfriend threatened to leave me if I didn't stop to talking to her, and after realising that my sanity was at stake, I told her that I will stop talking to her, BUT HERE'S THE CATCH, I WAS STILL TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND DIDN'T TELL MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT. After she confronted me about it, I finally stopped talking to her, but I guess it was too late. We didn't break-up, but she started bringing up breaking up with me frequently because of the way I treated her, she's right. I then, after realising how bad I fucked up, I started making amends, started trying to redeem myself but to no avail. Today, it has been 8 months since we started dating and one of her puppies died and I told her that I used to hurt myself because when she used to get mad and used to tell she'd rather be with ""A guy she knows"" because he wouldn't hurt her from the beginning, even though I swore never to hurt myself again. And now she doesn't want to be with me and also feels like killing herself because she hurt me, even though it is my fault and I should've told her earlier, she takes the blame on herself and doesn't want to be with me anymore. But I love her so much and she's the one person I'm never going to give up on, no matter what she says, it's either her or nobody else, now I am not trying to be toxic or manipulate her into staying with me, but I really don't want her to go, the pain of separation is way too much for me to deal with. I am sitting in my room with my lights off, tears rolling down my cheeks listening to death bed by POWFU thinking she was probably better off without me. I don't think I can live anymore."
1,"Dealing with depression or whatever i have.. So, i am new to reddit and i dont quite know how everything works yet, but i have been thinking about posting because i always read reddit about medications and depression/anxiety/bipolar to see others experiences and how they deal with them.

I have never been properly diagnosed. Well, I've been to many different people and i have gotten many different diagnosises: major depression, bipolar, schizophrenic. So, i have a lot of confusion within myself with my situation and its quite frustrating. It would be helpful to know whats going on with me so i could deal with what i have going on as best as possible. 

I guess im just ranting because i dont know i how to feel or what to do with anything i have going on. I feel so debilitated. On top of that i take medication, which is another annoying and confusing process within itself (having to figure what works for you and what dose works for you). I take Lamictal 400mg right now, but i dont know if thats too much because i feel like im having some cognitive issues like forgetting what im going to say mid sentence or have nothing to think of in general (very blank), but like i said very confusing because i dont know if its the medication doing that or the condition/mental illness that i deal with. Also, sexual dysfunction is THE WORST... Im 20 so this is a issue for me when it comes to medications. I never know how to feel about what im taking and when it comes to medication i am very impatient and freak out at the beginning when i start to feel all of the intial side effects. When that happens I'll self medicate and switch my dose by myself. I know this wont help anything, but ill have anxiety about it and just make a rash decision.

Sorry about the long post, but i feel like i dont have people that deal with similar issues to talk about this with. I feel like giving up a lot because i just dont know what to do anymore or how to fix myself or at least be a functional person. I've distanced myself from my friends and people i love and feel like I've ruined my relationship with my girlfriend because of the crazyness that i deal with and in turn put on other people.

Im lost and dont know what to do... HOW DO YOU DEAL OR GET OUT OF THIS?????"
1,"I ""basicly"" got...raped. Hi,

this is very actually pretty fucking hard for me to talk about this and its not a good way to post it on the internet. But I have to stand my fear. My heart is beating really fast.

So when I mean basicly, the process was the same, but with clothes on...It was in somewhere 7th grade maybe a year later. So its like 6-8 years after it happend. He bullied me 24/7 and he is one of the reason why I have depression, social anxiety etc. Im not sure how long it was all I did was trying to kick against his shinbone. But it didnt work, he just kept going. I just tried everything with my strength but I was too weak. After I dont know how long he let me go and we went back to class.

I want to kill this guy actually so bad. I remember his fucking name and if my life wont go better or just trash, I swear I will kill him, then kill myself no joke actually.

btw Im a boy if that matters anything. 

Im not sure what the fuck to expect as an answer. Im not even sure anyone will. But I really need any answer to this. Like...i dont know say something. Ill talk with my therapist about this tomorrow."
1,"I feel like i need to be beat down to get better.. It's very hard to explain, but I've been in a very fragile state the last year or two, and I feel like I'm finally opening my eyes for the first time. Due to some unfortunate traumatic events, I was taught at a very young age that anyone you trust can betray you and ruin your life, but somewhere along the lines, I still adapted a rather selfless personality (That isn't self-flattery). 

I have a serious problem with putting people before myself. Not so much doing favors and sacrificing my own, letting them walk all over me, but I invest all of my time thinking about my friends, partners, and family, alongside all their issues. I'm well aware that their problems aren't mine to take on, but I overthink them regardless. Same applies to my own issues, but it's much worse. Especially with the quarantine, I've been given a large amount of time to sit and think things over and over to the point of unhealthiness.

I've begun distancing myself from people, and usually that'd be a major sign to myself that things are getting bad, but it actually feels like my first step to healing. I am a very socially oriented person, and It's seriously taken a toll on me. Not to mention the fact that most of the people in my life wouldn't even put a fraction of as much thought into me as I do them. 

In an ideal situation, I isolate myself entirely from everyone, and take this time to learn how to focus on myself and bettering who I am. My only problem, however, is that I'm very back-and-forth with things (eg. leaving a partner, claiming it's for mental healing, and then coming back mere days later)  I convince myself that everybody overthinks as much as I do, and i convince myself i want that. I convince myself that I'm happy in whatever situation I'm in, and it always brings me back, no matter how terrible the scenario. 

What I feel like I need is a sign, I feel like I need something to remind me to never truly trust anybody, I need to be reminded that I never really mattered to them, because I don't. I need to push myself away from contact because somewhere through the years, I never learnt to be truest to myself. I need to be told that people leave and people die, and the only constant in my life will ever be me. I need to gain that sense of selfness that I'm sure could better me as a person.

1,"I lost my only friend because I'm an idiot.. I had an online friend for 2 years. He was the only one I talked to for 2 years. He talked me out of commiting suicide and helped me through depressive episodes. But then my dumbass starts to fall for him. At first it seemed like he felt the same, but then out of nowhere he told me he couldn't do it because he was too depressed. I respect that, but he also doesn't want to continue our friendship. He says it wouldn't be the same. I ffng loved him, he was the only person in te world I cared about. I feel so alone, I feel like I'm losing it. Why does everyone I care about walk out on me. It's come to the point where I don't see the point in continuing my life and it's killing me slowly."
1,"Family history of early death.. I was wondering if I'm alone in this thinking -
My parents and grandparents died at fairly early ages...50's to 70's.
As I consider the early ages of my parents and grandparents deaths, I am preoccupied with the idea that I am genetically predisposed to follow suit.
So, at the age of 60, I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop, so to speak (develop cancer or something).
I've dealt with severe depression all my life...and now at my age, this preoccupation feeds right into my depression.
Is there anyone out there that deals with something similar?"
1,"My depression is my own.. I credit my low self-esteem to all the years of being overworked and made to feel lesser in the military. I joined when I was 17 and I worked so hard to try to show everyone that I was good enough to be a Marine. In the end, I was just another cog that was continuously grounded down until it was time to replace me. All those years of being told that I was worthless have bled into my life post-military. 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the past five years. I've seen several therapists, most of them dismissing my case as a minor case. I've been suicidal only once after I attempted to end it with a gun in my mouth. My vice became alcohol and its wondrous ways of allowing you to forget the pain, even if it's temporary. 

When my son was born, all that changed. My days are brighter now with the newfound purpose of being a dad. I don't drink that often anymore and seeing my son's smile helps me forget my pain better than any bottle ever could. 

But, when he's not there, I still fight to keep my demons at bay. I can hear them clawing in the back of my mind, telling me that everyone's life would be better off with me dead. My life insurance would help my spouse have a home, it'd pay for my son's college, and set my parents and brother up for a long stretch of time. I've thought about it so many times. 

My depression is my own. It defines me when I'm at my weakest. It subsides when I'm at my strongest. It's a battle I'll fight for the rest of my life. One I'll suffer everyday for if it means seeing my son's smile again."
1,"I'm going to kill myself.. I think I've come to terms with it. Thats how I die. I know when. I know how. I know why. There is an odd sense of relief that comes over me when I think about it, I don't have to worry about anything anymore. No more loneliness, no more pain. It will all be over soon, all I have to do is wait a little bit longer and it will be perfect."
1,"I'm glad I'm suicidal. I haven't been suicidal since 4th grade and it feels really good to be back in this situation. I have always had chronic depression but it hasnt been this dark in years. 

I know the title is clickbait but I truly feel this way. It feels like now I've hit a new low and I can make progress to get out of it. Chronic depression is frustrating because it's a constant kinda shitty feeling. It's like wanting to cry after a hard day, week, month and not being able to. Once you finally cry it's so freeing and cathartic. 

Right now I feel more positive than I have been, maybe ever. It's only up from here for me. Maybe I'll have a few down turns but ultimately its for the best"
1,"i took a sip of bleach. &#x200B;

I've been depressed before and I've tried to kill myself twice but I failed both times. Life is going great for me but I've been feeling numb the past few weeks, I can't seem to figure out why.

I have no one to talk to or could help me anymore, I've lost the privilege of having someone I could hold onto/count on so usually I'd cut my tummy with a razor to calm myself down but today, 

I was crying really hard about NOTHING and I walked into the laundry room and straight up took a long sip of bleach and poured it all over me, I ruined a set of pjs and my favourite socks.

Then I cleaned up the laundry room and went into the shower and sat under running water for about an hour. 

&#x200B;

I don't feel sick or anything now but i'm scared to tell my mum that I drank bleach so I don't really know what to do and i read an article  about how someone drank a tub of bleach and died a few days later; I only took a sip though, I hope nothing happens."
1,"Im proud. Okay, so, This is lowkey bragging but im only doing it because im really proud of myself. So, ive struggled with eating disorder after eating disorder and loads of other things, i recently went vegetarian. But anyway, In 2 days it will be exactly a year since the last time i ever purged after binge eating and its been 3 months since the last time i starved myself. Not only that, but its been a month and a week since the last time i cut, 3 months and 5 days since the last time i burned myself and probably the thing im most proud of, Its been one year 4 months and 20 ish days since my last suicide attempt, Im really proud of myself and i have no clue how i've managed this well. I havent had any suicidal thoughts in about 2 months, Obviously i still get really depressed sometimes but ive managed to try and keep myself distracted so i dont do anything stupid. I'm really proud of myself and i literally dont know how i've managed this long, but i know i can make it much further, infact im gonna make sure i make it further. A few months ago i began stockpiling things for a suicide again but a few weeks ago i realised how much better i was getting and threw everything away including my blades, I've had urges but ive not let them get the best of me. I hope everyone else out there who suffers gets okay someday, everyday is a battle but i promise you can make it, i promise."
1,"how will i help my bestfriend when we're both hopeless. my bestfriend wants to die now, so am i. she wants to die because of her fucked up father who's always physically and mentally abusing them. i am the only one she talks to about that and i want to help her. but i dont know what to do because im just as hopeless as her. we're both tired of living. but im telling her that taking our lives is not a good choice. but still, i want to help her. but how?"
1,"Regret of something i did as a teen need advice/help. When I was younger I have faint memories of being abused which caused me to become hyper sexual at a young age. I seemed to have blurred the lines of right and wrong and made excuses for people I cared about.

Sex was not talked about to me ever at all in my family. I was an awkward shy kid full of shame and highly sensitive/insecure. I found porn on a TV I had and porn in my dads room. It haunted me at first and then I got curious and would look at it sometimes. Cut to my teens when puberty hit for me (F)(I was a late bloomer 14/15) and my sexual urges became heightened. I was confused cause noone talked about it with me. Fast forward one day my dog sniffed my private while I was changing and I thought ""i wonder what oral would feel like” cause i saw it in porn and i thought other kids my age were trying it whilst also copying porn. I put something over my underwear for her to lick off and I remember thinking i was only going to do it for a second but it lasted longer. After i felt weird and dirty but brushed it off. About a year later I eventually told my mom bc the guilt was eating me alive. And now it's coming back again years later. I feel paralyzed with guilt and shame. I feel like I destroyed my life. idk how to move on. Is there a way? I feel so alone but also deserving. I'd never physically hurt a person or animal and it makes me feel like shit that I thought that was ok at the time.  I've prayed to god for forgiveness every time I think about it and will be for the rest of my life but I don't feel forgiven bc I can't seem to forgive myself. Quite frankly it makes me feel like i was like an abuser/predator and my mind connects with awful criminal type people. I want to feel like a good person again but my thoughts want me to punish myself but i can't bc i love my family and they hate seeing me in bed 247.  

Has anyone else overcome/done something like this? Is this a common adolescent thing? I feel extremely embarrassed and alone about this please help"
1,"The birth control pills are deteriorating my mental health at a lightening speed. It’s the second week of taking BC, and these couple days have been feeling like hell. Today is the worst. My original plan was to go to the grocery store and home workout, the usual quarantine routine. However, I feel exhausted and lightheaded. I thought I just didn’t have enough sleep, but a 2-hour nap didn’t help at all. 

My emotion is probably hitting the lowest at all time. I’m easily triggered by little things, which lead to me sobbing uncontrollably for a couple times today. I’ve talked to a couple of close friends and family about the side effects of the pills, but I didn’t mention how much of a disaster it costs to mental health, as an attempt to try to keep my sanity, but I know I’m only barely holding onto it. Even though I enjoy living alone, the loneliness and daily isolation even made it worse on all kind of level. I’m not sure what is my next step, either to inform my gyno or go to therapy."
1,"Lost my job and too depressed to do anything about it.. I don't have a job anymore and I'm too depressed to try to find another one (if there are any).  I just stay at home hating myself. I stopped eating, stopped washing myself, and I almost don't sleep anymore. I wish I had the strenght to get my shit together and find a solution, but I can't. After all, like people on reddit have told me countless times, I'm just a ""whiny littlr bitch""."
1,"I can’t handle isolation/distancing anymore.. I’ve never felt so lonely in my life, and I’m lonely at baseline. This is getting to be too much. I sit in bed all day, not being able to get a handle on my binge eating disorder. What else would I do? I’m empty. This has been the worst I’ve ever felt with my depression. I understand what’s healthy for you and what’s not. I’ve tried sitting out in fresh air with a cup of tea but the sinking numb feeling was still overwhelmingly there. I tried to go on walks and runs but I just want to go back home the entire time. I stare at these walls all day. I text people who don’t text me first but honestly I don’t care, not seeing people in person is getting stale. I need human interaction. I’m an “essential worker” or whatever as a nurse but I’m a new nurse so this shit is really stressful and hard. My preceptor tears me apart. So the time I should be using to relax and recuperate is filled with staring at walls, being alone. I’ve never felt so off the handles in my life. I’ve turned to wine because it makes me feel normal, but I have a family history of addiction. So I’ve had to tell myself no a few times. Feels like my life is going absolutely no where. Maybe it is going no where. I just need this to be over so maybe I can see that one friend that hangs out with me. I’m going insane."
1,"Can anyone else not really sleep during a really bad depressive episode?. Sometimes I can’t sleep at all during a bad depressive episode. Like I’m talking days, it’s like I’ll close my eyes and instead of sleep it’s just this endless buzz in my head of everything that is wrong with me and my surroundings. I’m plagued by exhaustion, yet cannont sleep and instead lie awake in a negative thought loop. Unable to move, unable to distract myself, or sleep. I just lay there, unnervingly trapped by my own my mind. Listening to every thought that pops up.  This can last for days. Is anyone else plagued by this nasty insomnia?"
1,"Feeling useless and worthless. Can’t do anything whatsoever, can’t even get out of bed hardly. I’m the odd one out in my family. Do nothing all day long. Too sad and depressed to do anything. Think about suicide a lot. It’s been like this for too long and don’t know what the hell I can do."
1,"It doesn't get better. Fuck off with that shit. It drives me up the fucking wall when people say it gets better. I've had ONE single issue be the main cause of my depression my entire life. That's a lack of a social life. 

I'm incredibly lonely. As in I've NEVER had friends in real life. I've tried everything and anything. Fuck off with the ""it gets better!"" 

I can only imagine if my depression WASN'T situational. My situation can theoretically change, as it's an outside factor (even though I know it will never change), but if my depression wasn't situational, hearing that would drive me nuts. It doesn't get better a lot of the time. Sorry for the cold truth. 

I still think life is precious(?) and shouldn't be ended early. Experience it while you can even if it sucks ass. Cause you'll never get another chance. I just live for food and videogames, but there's always something semi-enjoyable out there that you'll never get another chance in eternity to experience. Just wish people would stop with that dumb fucking lie. It's just such a stupid thing to say."
1,"Online Classes are killing me. I am so tired and so depressed, but my anxiety always makes me complete my work last minute. I am so stressed out and I feel like I am on the verge of a mental breakdown. I hate it, but there is nothing I can do.  I just keep doing my work and wishing I was dead and being terrified of getting bad grades. I hate this. Fuck this virus. It has literally made my mental illnesses 10x worse and there is nothing I can do."
1,"I dont know. Every time when I ask myself ""why are you depressed?"" my answer is always I dont know or a spiral of self hate and things not working out, which is normal, its part of life. I dont know, I'm just weak and I'm a coward. Do I even know what depression is? what it means to be depressed? I dont know. Why do I find it so difficult to effectively convey my feelings to myself nevermind to anyone else. I dont know. I just don't know anymore. My life is fine. I just don't know why I'm like this. I dont understand myself and I wish I did, but unfortunately, a guide book for my mind doesn't exist. And it's like I like being depressed, its almost as in I put myself in this mindset intentionally, which sounds quite crazy and sadistic. I like the pain, I like feeling worthless and a failure. But then, I dont like feeling like this and just want to be okay again, normal i guess. Ah I dont know. Whenever I feel like this, I just tell myself to ""firm it and keep moving"", it's the only thing I can do. But, I dont even know how long i can firm it until I'm at a point of no return. I dont know."
1,"I hate the unknown. It sucks. It sucks monkey balls. It sucks so much, that it feels like I'm suffocating.
Being useless all your life and Everytime you do something, big or small it feels like ""is it worth it? Will it work? Will it make a change?"" Enough doubt and fear just takes over of you aren't good enough, nobody is REALLY going to help you. Nobody cares, so why even try? 
If I really reach out for help in something not for me, will people even read it and help so I don't bare the blunt of guilt when it all goes wrong? 

Sorry guys just wanted to vent here a bit. I will delete this later."
1,Someone close to me tried to get me to open up... in the wrong way :/. I was venting a little and this person said ‘So why don’t you kill yourself / Didn’t kill yourself when you felt depressed?’ I know it wasn’t meant  like in a bad way but I just feel like it was really inappropriate to ask me that. Am i overthinking this? as this is always stuck in my mind now
1,"Why does disassociation feel so good?. For the first few weeks of lockdown I was almost inconsolable, but now I've found the one thing that helps - completely 'tapping out.' It's utter bliss, like a taster of death without the commitment. Why is disassociation bad for you if it feels so good? It just feels completely freeing."
1,"I've found out just how hollow I am.. I've kept two ""friends"" around after finding out that both of em talk shit about each other behind their backs. They said plenty about me too. I kept them around because I found it so funny that they'd constantly lie to my face. Had enough and cut them both off yesterday after threatening them. I don't know what came into me I guess  I was just so enraged that they lied to my face. 

They tried getting back to normal with me by telling me that I got the wrong guy before I cut them off. They got upset that I threatened them and started yelling at me. I told him to stop the tough talk and roll up on me cause they know where I live. It was going to be a knife fight. I grabbed my blade, my mask, and my hoodie and waited....and waited. They never showed up after the tough talk. 

I was really ready to die. All I could think was, kill. It seemed so unlike me, I didn't know who I was in that moment. I've thought of buying a pistol and rolling up on em but once I calmed down I realized this isn't worth it and left it as it was. I'm so empty I only have two emotions. Numb or enraged. If I don't control myself I'm going to end up dead or worse, in prison. 

My depression is the angry type. I never thought it would get this bad to where I'd literally flirt with danger. 

I just needed somewhere to put this. Thank you for reading if you did. Otherwise -

TLDR: Kept fake friends around to learn how to see through them. They lied to my face, I got enraged, invited them to a knife fight. Came to the conclusion I need to get help."
1,"i wish i had supportive parents who don't think depression is bullshit.. my mom misunderstands depression on a fundamental level. i don't think she'll ever really understand. it sucks. it makes me feel stuck. there's nothing i can do, nowhere i can go. i'm trapped in this house full of insensitive and ignorant people. it hurts. my mental state is so fucked."
1,Depression sinking in.... Hi I’m new to this sub I’m 20 years old and lately I keep having weird dreams that my fiancé is cheating on me I cant help but go through his phone sometimes and I find things I don’t like sometimes I talk to him about it but sometimes I just keep it to myself because I don’t wanna have the conversation I just wanna have happy days with him but now I’m to the point I want to just stop breathing at a times...I love this man more than anyone I do more for him than I have ever done for myself and my heart is aching the past 2 years we have gone through nothing a young couple should have to go through but it has grown us closer and stronger together as a couple I just don’t understand I’m so loyal I’ve Always been that way I’m just so lost and sad and I have no one to talk to someone help...
1,"It's 3 in the morning. Last month I lost my sister in a car accident. We had a bond which was tighter than the one I have with my parents. I'm not able to sleep at night. I actually fear going to sleep (dark thoughts come across my mind). 

I miss here so so terribly. She was young just 24. The achiever within the family while I still struggle in college. It should have been me. I try to be brave for my parents. But they too are too broken to recover. It's too much. 

I can't go on. I don't see it ever getting better.
It's just too much. Too much... 

It's 3 in the morning.
And the demons have returned.
In my mind I hear a warning.
But it is too late to run.

I want to scream and thrash.
But I'm tied me to the bed.
A tear rolls down my cheek.
Signaling my spirit to be dead.

A calmness comes over me.
I find comfort in the inevitable.
But then images of my family float.
And thus starts the trouble.

I'm at crossroads, not sure what to do.
Had you been here, I wouldn't be feeling so blue.

I make up my mind.
Far too long have I suffered.
Over the table lies the tiny escape.
It will be quick, it will be painless.
I say as my heart starts to flutter.

I close my eyes, letting the deed take it's course.
There's no turning back I say.
It's time to jump across.

It's 3 in the morning
Finally will I sleep
And when I meet you in the light,
shall I smile and weep"
1,"quarantine is killing me. i feel like whenever i talk to somebody i make them feel bad bcs they know im bad, they try to make me realize that im in a bad mentality, and i end up screwing up everything and asking them to leave me alone in here, in my bad mentality, my even suicidal mentality these days
i asked my few friends to only text me if the conversation will end up with me being better but they dont care and we almost everytime end arguing bout shit that only makes me feel worse
also, i feel pressured with the tasks from school bcs i know that my future is the one that will end up fucked if i dont do them but in my home there's only 1 computer for me, my mother, whose work is in the air at the moment, and my brother
i dont know what to do, i feel worse and worse, more distanced with people that wasnt distanced with me when this shit started
im from Spain, i probably wrote something wrong gramatically or idk
i just want this shit to end, i had a weak mindset before this and this just made it even weaker

as i said, English isn't my first language so sorry if something is wrong"
1,Always angry. I’m always angry. Even when I’m happy deep down there is this burning anger inside of me. I can mostly control it but every few years that fire burns too much for me to handle. When that happens people around me get hurt. I’ve been to therapy but that never helped. All therapy does is teach you how to bury that anger. It never teaches you how to control it. That I learned myself. I learned to focus that in things like the gym or in arguments. I occasionally use it to hurt people that deserve it. But recently I’ve stopped going to the gym because of my depression. And due to the corona virus there’s no ways for me to use my anger productivity. I can feel the flame getting bigger and I know sooner or later it’s going to take over Andy family are going to be the ones who get burned. I need this lockdown to be over for their sake.
1,"What led you to the hospital?. What events triggered your depression early in your life? What triggers it now? What prevented you from seeking help before? What difficulties do you have with practicing your coping skills? Can you identify your mood and activities throughout the day? What pleasant activities do you do in order to cope? What events led you to the hospital? 

Im trying to help my therapist understand me better but I dont understand a lot about myself."
1,"another person with daddy issues. its me again. ive watched a movie with my sister, imaginaerum, and honestly i got deep in thought

for those who didnt watch, relationship of main character gem with her father is the key point of the movie. shes salty, shes pissed, she hates him most of the time but ends up forgiving him before he passes away.

and all that got me thinking of how much my life is ruined now and beyond fixing because my father was doing what he wanted all the time. usually it was drinking and trying to hit the jackpot. he spend all his life being given things, so he wanted to be rich easly too. except... then he would waste it all to get drunk. and its been always like that, aside from threats about killing my mom flying around the house, broken plant pots, plates and other stuff. he chilled now but im still here stuck with him.

and i cant even think of what i lost because of him. my childhood, my possible friendships, my possible romance, my holidays and vacations, my education, three years wasting away at home and then another three of wasting away and *sometimes* going to shit job that i hate with horrible pay. and all this is still continuing and i cant start living because lol... for what money

i cant even have good paying job because im hs dropout. i dont have driving license either. i started the course to get it two years ago but i didnt pass two exams and quit trying... thats pretty telling about me

i just. need someone to help me pull it together because i cant do it on my own. and i got no one. i just cant do this anymore i hate him so much he destroyed everything for me, even my own brain. otherwise i wouldnt have this awful depression with szpd. i just cant anymore"
1,"is it normal to hide your depression from everyone?. i’ve been depressed for about 1,5 years now, possibly more. besides the counselor i was talking to last year i haven’t told anyone definitively that i’m depressed. in fact i go to great lengths to convince people around me the opposite, that i’m happy. i think some of the closest people know i’m struggling, but i’ve never talked about it.

the reason is that i’m ashamed to feel like this. i’m afraid that word gets around that “OP is depressed” and so on. i basically fear being judged, but also that i will be treated with pity."
1,Is drawing making people think that I am a useless being?.  I mean like people that draw (or who is dealing with art) for a living are seen as useless to the world. I like drawing because it helps me think away from all the bad shit and I wanna pursuit in my life as a software engineer but every time I show one of my drawing piece to one of my friends or family they encourage me to pursuit drawing instead and his advice makes me feel dumb(mentally) numb and useless. please help
1,"i don’t even feel like i can talk. 
i feel so unimportant, so useless that my words don’t even matter, i try to talk about how i feel to people or in a place like this but i always feel so stupid after, i’m wasting people’s time. i don’t get why im rejecting my own feelings, the experiences i go through. maybe i haven’t suffered enough, i don’t have a direct cause for my depression, i don’t know how long i’ve felt like this, just a long time. i know how it feels to hate waking up every day, crying at the fact you woke up again. so why can’t i let myself be listened to, have someone help me."
1,"i don’t feel like doing anything anymore. like the title says i don’t have desire to do stuff anymore. anytime i think about doing something i almost always seem to resort to “i really don’t have the energy for this”. 
it’s like in general the effort needed to do ANYTHING vastly outweighs the reward. i go to work, because you need to for income, but that’s about it. i think due to depression my brains reward system is not working correctly, this could be symptoms of anhedonia."
1,"I know nobody cares but.. I am **SO SICK** of being more emotionally mature than my own mother, especially since 1) I'm not actually all that emotionally mature and 2) I'm stuck living with her. At 29. Because I'm so emotionally immature that I couldn't finish college or get a job that pays enough or keep the job I did have because I'm such a fuck-up.

That is all. Just really needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for letting me vent to you instead of blowing up at her and making things even worse."
1,I feel i can't take it anymore. Everyday one of my thoughts say mm what if you just kill yourself but then I think in my mom and the pain I cause her and that stops me but i hate this life I'm not happy I hate my life
1,its so easy to annoy me now. i hate how bad my depression has gotten.. i just dont want to talk to anyone everything just annoys me and pisses me off i hate this i hate myself i hate everything
1,Tired of this world. People are dying everyday and it could have been prevented. People think it’s a conspiracy. It’s not as bad as pneumonia they say. All you need to take are vitamins. I’m constantly surrounded by ignorant selfish people who parrot what the news tells them. There is no convincing them otherwise. They think this is all fake. They vote against their own interests. They are making the world worse. I’m tired of people being this dumb and selfish. I wish I wasn’t around any more. I believe in God but I can’t understand why this needed to happen. I cant believe what is happening everyday. I can’t believe how shitty people are. I wish everyone could just wake up. I just can’t deal with this anymore.
1,"I dont think im going to be around in a years time. im 17 and i really dont want to live anymore. now this prob sounds like the edgy teenager that doesnt want to live anymore but listen, i genuinely dont want to. my life is going into the shit, and im not doing too good so im giving myself a year, it its still fucking shit and life is a giant burden and i cant find anything to live for then im out of here. im sick and tired of cutting myself and crying until i cant anymore. im sick and tired of missing someone who is with someone else. im sick and tired or just being stressed and never feeling happy. i really hope my life works out in a year but this is it ig. if i cant find anything to live for then i dont want to live anymore."
1,"Got rejected by all universities and scholarships, feeling absolutely worthless. Hey there, everyone. This will be a slightly long post, so I will understand if you do not read all the way through. 

I am an international student who has previously applied to the United States for further education, along with scholarships in my home country. The results were abysmal - I got rejected from 6 out of the 8 universities which I applied to, had to rescind one offer because I couldn't supply my finances in time and got accepted into one. I've had no luck on the scholarship front either. 

I've not been taking this news well at all. I was really harbouring great dreams to go to the US to study music, and it feels like my dreams have all been smashed. I genuinely thought I had a chance of getting in to the schools I wanted, but now it feels like reality has delivered the verdict, and the truth of it is I simply haven't accomplished as much with my life as I thought I did. It feels like all I've done has amounted to nothing. 

A good majority of my close friends did manage to get into reputable overseas universities, and I can't help feeling left out and utterly inferior to them. I can't socialise with other people now without constantly being reminded of my own inability to achieve things. They say that to be successful you ought to surround yourself with successful people to learn from them, but all I feel is inadequacy. 

I've also felt that my learning capabilities have become compromised. Now I feel either cynical, impatient or resigned while learning. I have no mood to learn new things and I can't help getting a feeling of, ""my time has passed, I should have done all these things during childhood,"" when picking up new skills. I get really impatient now and constantly expect quick results, which usually don't happen and end up making me even more frustrated. 

I've had depressive episodes before, but last year was really a hopeful and inspiring one because I was stepping out of my comfort zone and I was really trying to take life in new directions I hadn't gone to before. 2020 is turning out to be the antithesis of that - getting rejected feels like all I'm doing has come to naught and everything I've tried to build has been a lie. I'm sinking into a slump where every day just passes by in a blur and I don't know how to shake it off. 

This is just a bad year all-round. I'm aware that all of this has sounded like self-absorbed narcissistic whining, but I wanted to get it off my chest regardless. Thanks everyone if you've read this far, and I hope that all of you are coping well with the coronavirus quarantine yourselves."
1,"Life is getting harder and harder each day that goes on.. I don't even know where to start to be honest. I wan't to visit someone for help whether it be a doctor to inject me with momentary happiness that I need to restock, or someone to talk to on a regular basis. Life is getting rough though. And I am not talking about the whole Covid-19 situation as it does not phase me, my lifestyle, nor my employment. Rather life's toll has become every increasing. I play songs at night and they keep me awake in a pool of tears for various reasons. I find a new song an within a week it will make me burst out in tears. I've lost all enjoyment from my passion. I miss my childhood most of all and wish I could reset my life. Start over and correct my screw ups. I know it's not possible. I've spent nights praying to gods I don't believe in for any kind of escape. Begging to make a deal with the devil for a window of escape, but to no avail. The color of the world has started to fade. Every day I miss work more and more. I go on a week long binge of skipping work because I cant bear to get out of bed. I'd rather sit and do nothing. Trash piling up around me. I can't listen to music anymore without getting emotional and watching videos or playing games feels bland and boring. I try to sing, write, draw, anything. Nothing makes me feel anything. I started drinking more and more, but it's just blurring everything together. I don't know where I am going with this, but I feel lonely, afraid, and like I am slowly losing touch with reality."
1,"Had I not chased love, it would be 90% easier to reach my highest potential.. One of my core issues was taking love so seriously as to let it be one of the causes of my depression. Throughout high school, my main problem was trying to find that coveted word, online and in person, failing over and over and over. It was a passion equal to my true passion, fiction writing. 

Over the years, I've come to realize how it's pointless to waste energy on romantic love. Time and time again, I find the energy I put into that is the energy that should be veered toward actual important endeavors. 

Although the desire isn't nearly as strong as it was in high school, I still desire it and I still fear having it taken away from me, which seems to be the case now. What I realize after a post I saw on FB one day is that, I could have and can be working near my highest potential if I'd let that part of me go. Surely, I'd feel less depressed if I stopped putting my worth in that sickening want. It would be a weight lifted off my shoulders. 

So now I'm trying to find a way to staunch that desire entirely or near enough."
1,"I am done with always feeling like the most worthless thing that exists. I hate myself more than anything in this messed up world , but I am done waiting for some miracle or sudden change. It isn't going to happen by itself.

I have extreme depression , anxiety , suicidal thoughts 24/7 and I know one day I am going to end my own life . But I want to have some fun before it. 

I want to get high , drunk with friends , go to a club , have sex , travel and have a real fancy meal in a fine restaurant. My life goals aren't complex , but those memories will be everything I will have while looking back at my shitty ""life"".

I just hope this terrible times with corona will pass as soon as possible , so I can get out of my home prison and try to feel alive and not dead and hollow inside.

Fuck school and terrible  abusive parents who don't understand grades aren't important if just not committing suicide or self-harming takes the majority of your energy and focus.

If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or you think you might be starting to develop depression , please go see a professional before it's too late like for me."
1,"My therapist is busy, please give your thoughts. My ex and I are on very good terms. We are both struggling with depression and decided now wasn't a good time for either of us to be dating. 

Anyways, we are talking as friends and I am slowly but surely becoming ok with not being together as we were. It was a short relationship though it was codependent so bonds were formed very quickly and strongly. 

When I close my eyes I imagine she's holding me, telling me everything will be okay, as she has in the past. I am having a hard time seeing this as a friendship even though I know that's what's best for us both. 

Do you have any advice on how to handle this alone and viewing her as a friend? Also, any ideas on other things I can imagine when that image pops into my head?"
1,"My brain can’t comprehend its own stupidity.. I wasn’t always this stupid. A mixture of indulgence and bad timing made me like this. I was a smart kid and took it for granted. I had a general grasp on topics, but only took interests in sports, music, video games and girls. So dumb. I am utilizing none of these interests for my everyday life.

My father succumbed to cancer when I was 14 and I’m 22 now. He had it for 5 years prior and those years seemed to last decades and minutes at the same time. Decades because of how everyone approached me and treated me just because my dad had cancer. Minutes because of the knowledge I was able to extract from my dad. I always wish I asked more questions, but what did I know at that age. 

This dilemma stunted my growth into becoming who I am. I still don’t really know, honestly. I became numb to everything and stopped caring about my future because I didn’t know what life would be like without my best friend. It’s awful kid.

Now that I’m older and in my prime, I can only think about how I’ve wasted my life. Quitting college after a year, no girlfriend, no job and living at home again because of a pandemic. I don’t know where to go and I’m tired of pretending that life will find a way. Life’s “way”, leads me to more and more pain without any compensation. My patience for my death is dwindling daily. Idk why I made this post because you all have your own issues. I just want a reason to stay alive."
1,"I have no one to turn to. I’m going through a hard time in my life (isn’t everyone these days).
I think I might be breaking up with my long term boyfriend. And I’m... pretty broken up about it. Constant, fat tears... I couldn’t stop shuddering... I was in physical pain and it felt like my chest was collapsing in on itself. The worst part about this is that he was my only friend. I literally have *no one* to talk to about this. I don’t have a support system. It was just him. I know that was unfair, but I was trying to change it. All of my friendships have fallen apart for various reasons that I had nothing to do with. I don’t feel close with my family. I didn’t mean to make him my only point of support. I guess it doesn’t matter now. I have no one to message and just talk to. Of all the people I do know, I’m not close enough to any of them to reach out. They’re not anything beyond surface level friends. It’s not their fault, or bad necessarily. They’re good people. I don’t blame them. I feel a sense of mourning. I never got to tell him that for months I have been thinking about how great it will be to put his towel in the dryer while he showers, but I didn’t want to tell him (and I’m terrible at keeping secrets) because I wanted to see the surprised look on his face. I’ll never see that now. I feel weird “mourning” the family we would have had and the life we would’ve built. Thinking about that makes me wonder if I’m making a mistake by stepping back, but talking to him right now is bringing such great emotional pain that I physically hurt. I never wanted this to happen. I was afraid something like it would. I’m realizing now that is what I’d be telling a friend if a had one. Now that I’ve slept a little and I’m sitting here... I feel this calm melancholy. My chest still hurts but I’ve stopped crying. I desperately don’t want it to be... but I think it’s over. I have this feeling, like... it’s hard to describe. I know I’ve been too much of a burden on him, and he’ll never directly tell me but being with him is too much for him and it’s hurting him. I’m hurting him by being with him because of the way I am. I question if I ever actually worked on myself... I think I did. But in hard times I have been melting a little, and I think it’s just too much. This, combined with som other crap that happened a little while ago, just makes me feel so... numb. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet to be honest. 
I love him so, so very much but the pain is just too much. Some of it isn’t his fault but I also feel like he could’ve taken a leap of faith for me, and didn’t, and I’m crushed. I thought I had shown that I would have his back, but thinking backwards in time to other conversations we’ve had, it’s clearer to me he doesn’t completely trust me for some reason and I don’t know why. His schooling means so much to me, I wouldn’t have gotten in the way of that... I would’ve done everything to help make it easy. Make help him staying here as comfortable as possible. I believed he’d want to stay, to weather this storm together... but I was wrong. Said he didn’t think it through enough. He talked to his family and they advised against it... I understand because of the circumstances... I feel like they mistrust me too... for some reason there was some perceived ill intentions in things went down... but I just wanted to see him. They said it was okay and after believing all this time he’d come be by my side, he said no. And it’s not just that he’s not here with me. He thinks I wouldn’t do everything and anything to help facilitate his success and help him thrive. I don’t know why. A long time ago, we were talking about something to do with school, and I can’t remember the specifics but he said something to effect of “I don’t trust you to not get mad at me for doing my work” or something. And I *heard* him, and I swear I wasn’t doing anything but being supportive of him going to school but he felt like I’d impede him. I was crushed then, we were sitting in my car but I made an excuse to go to the bathroom to go cry. I don’t know what I did to make him feel like he can’t trust me.... I trust him completely and it lead to my heart feeling so broken. I feel like a sore idiot for going on about being sad and “heart broken” but if you really think someone is the one and it gets messed up... I’m reeling. If I had known that the last time I saw him was gonna he the *last* time... I can’t think about it too much or I’ll just cry. I don’t really know what to say now. I tried to keep my cool so that he’d see I was trying to be responsible, and he’d see I was trying to be good. I didn’t want to lose my marbles and ask him why or be sad, I’ve ruined any chance of seeing him at all. None of this has properly sunk in. I don’t have to save my Instagram memes anymore, all of what I have saved is... just... nothing now. I’ll never get to hug him again, I can’t show him how much I care and that I’d never hurt him and that I want him to feel whole and happy... I’ll never get to live with him and warm his towels or have his beans or know what it’s like to be with him. I feel like I’m doing something rash... but there’s this weird calm... I think it has to be this way... he will be able to thrive without me, and I know he’ll be able to do his work with flying colors... I’m not worried about that. But I just feel so... lost. 


What now ?"
1,"Kinda lost man. I don't really know if this is the right subreddit but I have no idea where else to turn. I'm a guy so it feels like no one really takes me seriously. 

Fuck man I'm getting so tired and I don't know how to express what I'm feeling and English is not my först language so this might be just me rambling incoherently and I'm sorry about that but I hope you can bare me out cause I really need to get this shit off my chest... 

My mom and dad split when I was very young 
My mom had 2 kids before me and a lie after me, all with different men and all of them bailed and left my mom with the kids(except my dad). 
She used a lot speed and gambled her way into debt and struggled alot with mental illness 
She couldn't handle everything so i moved to my dad and his new woman (I call her mom) and her daughter (my big sis) when I was 2. 
From there on I spent 1 week at my dad and then 1 week at my moms. So I was kind of the outsider of both of my families, this continued for quite a while, 2 different sides of life. 

1 week at my dads place, which was a nice smalltown with a nice daycare and school and 1 week with my mom and my now 3 other siblings (i got a new younger sister) wherever we lived at the moment ( she moved around quite a lot) 

I liked to be at my moms place, she wasnt as strict as me ex military dad but he had his reasons. But I spent my entire childhood going back and forth between two different worlds and missing out on both, not feeling like I was in center of anything, on my moms side I think I was seen with some resent for being able to live with my fancy dad and still being the most chaotic of us. And at my dads they saw me as a kid who couldn't behave. 

I was outside everywhere. Friend groups, family and just mentally alone, but god knows I tried, I tried way to hard and that fucked it up for me everytime but I tried. My parents hated eachother for so long and I was a pawn in my moms game and I ended up hating my dad for many years and I Will always hate myself for that, he was hard on me but he is a goddamn good dad and he tried. He even tried when I was a heavy drug user at 16 to 20 years old. He saw me take my older brothers (moms side) steps and he couldnt see all the mental problems I had and I don't blame him, he grew up where men didnt show that they suffered so it angered him. 

I was pretty good at masking my lonlieness with friends who liked that I did stupid shit and that I got angry easily. But Fuck I spent so many years crying myself to sleep and sleeping in the warmth of the shower. I just wanted to feel like I belonged. 
Fast forward to 2017 and many drugs and bad behaviour, my parents kicked me out and I spent a year couch surfing and sleeping rough until I met my girlfriend, half a year after my ex cheated on me with my friend and after I vowed to never trust love because I fall really easy and I have bad judgement but damn it was like the sky turned and I felt like home, I can't describe it but it felt like your soul got a warm close hug after staying at the bottom of a cold sea. All my self harm, all the cuts, all the drugs, every lonley night every single time I tried to make it over the edge of that fucking bridge, every overdose. It was all worth it and I would have done it 10 times over. She was so goddamn beautiful, and those eye man... those eyes. I would break every bone in my body just to look into those eyes and be certain that it was with love they looked back at me again.

The first mistake I made was that I went to fast, I moved in in under a month and I was blind to the signs. I know I fall for the broken type and you'd think that comes with a certain eye for when things are sketchy but no. It took me 4 months until I realised that she was cheating with multiple guys and I stood there outside the window and seeing her in panties on a guy on the couch. That was 2 years ago on the 9th of april and I'm too this day certain that a part of me died that night. I went in and picked up my stuff and went on my way to my first OD in a while. I survived. I licked my wounds for a while knowing I had to keep of the drugs I had already damaged my family, my mom my dad and my 2 angels ( my younger sisters) I couldnt get lost again, I needed them to see me happy and alive.

My girlfriend wanted me back and I couldnt walk away from that feeling I had before, even if that meant living with the old familiar feeling of never being someones number one. For a year forward I was treated like shit and still saw signs of infidelity until I caught her with more then just messages. She had been to a guys place pretty close to where we lived so I went to talk to him (She was at Home every day while I was working full time so we could survive) he told me they had met but nothing had happened, but that she had been coming on pretty strong but he didnt like her.

 I Think she was looking for a guy similar to the guy I first guy I caught her with... She would have done anything for him. It took her over a year to post that she was in a relationship with me because she was afraid what he would think. I did everything for her but he was still number one. 
Anyways... 

I confronted her and she told me she loved me now, forreal and she had problems and wanted to change so she changed (or cleaned up her act) and she worked on herself and slowly began to treat me better. But it never felt like she's really attracted to me like she had been to other guys, even then when really hot women came onto me I never gave or give anyone a single signal. Instead I'm always there for my baby, when she is down i leave work and come Home, when we fight and she turns it around to be my fault I say Im sorry, and its slowly killing my self respect. And now 2020 its much better between us and I have my son (my dog) who means the world to me and my family is so proud of me and everyone turns to me with their problems cause its easy to talk to me and I understand them but I'm so fucking lost, I'm a guy but why does noone hug me when Im down, why do a man have to ask his woman to go an extra mile to pick him up. Why is a man seen as annoying when he is needy? Why do only girls deserve romantic gestures that solidify what love someone have for them. Im so tired of being ashamed for being down and sad, for crying and not being able to pick myself up and be happy. Why don't I deserve to feel like I know where home is? I cant see a home in the world as it is and it breaks me every single day to wake up with this feeling, being surrounded by people but feeling like the lonliest man alive, deattached from everyone. I cant even sleep and find peace cause there are the nightmares and sleep paralysis waiting and the sleeping meds are a joke, the therapist meetings just makes me feel more alienated. I'm just so fucking lost

sorry for the bible."
1,"I’m a boring person. I have no interest or hobbies, and I wish I could stop feeling so hopeless and have a clear fucking direction.. I used to always say I had no time to do what I wanted to do because of school. But when virus put school on stop, I didn’t do any of the things I wanted to do. I had an anxiety attack as I there were so many things I wanted to do, but I felt so hopeless, and I didn’t know what to do. I feel like there’s so much I want to express but there’s no activity I don’t feel stressed, or frustrated in. I just want to have a moment where I don’t fuck anything up, because it seems that I haven’t done anything right my entire life. I feel so fucking hopeless all the time."
1,"If it werent for the covid19 I would have ended up dead. I will make it short

I am in my late 20s, graduated 4 years ago with a useless degree

Been working in retail part time and taking care of my ill parents and grandparents

My ""friends"" are already married or in a relationship with good and well paid jobs always bully me that I am a parasite who lives at home and it is my fault. Believe me that it is very difficult to find a good job with zero connections and move alone because no savings at all...

This covid19 that destroyed the global economy serves me as an ""excuse"" to why I still live with my parents because now I am unempLoyed but nowadays IT IS FUCKING NOT MY FAULT!!!!!!!!!! NEARLY 25% OF UNEMPLOYMENT HERE!!!!!!

So, without the covid19 I think that I would have ened up really depressed because of my failure to become a real person like everybody else. N eeded to vent."
1,"Doubt anyone will read this. I’m so emotionally tired, of everything. I look back on my life and see a never ending amount of failures. Went through a length unemployment gap and was then employed as an employment consultant. Presumably to churn and burn me. I should be thrilled for even having a job, but honestly I fucking hate it. The kpi’s, the constant up and down rollercoaster of emotions everyday, difficult clients and just being told to shake it off. It’s a horrible industry and I feel like I’m losing myself.

I’m a sensitive person, I’m not ashamed of that. It allows me to read people really well. But honestly, it’s a blight and fucking curse. 

Where do I fit? Obviously fucking no where. Non existence would be blessing, and not waking up even better. Clocks ticking"
1,"Honestly, disappearing forever doesn’t sound so bad right now.. I can’t sleep right anymore. Waking up every few hours from a nightmare about her to cold sweat and a pillow full of tears is taking its toll on me. I kept having the same nightmares every time I close my eyes. I kept seeing her with someone else in my nightmares and I know she’s probably with someone else in my reality too. It hurts the most when you know she has moved on. How could she move on so fast? We broke it off for a few days and she’s already talking to someone new. Was it really love if she could just move on that fast from a 5 years relationship? 5 years and it only took her a few days to start talking to someone new? I know I did many things wrong and I regret every single one of them, but how can she just throw away 5 years full of memories for a new person just like that? 

The pain is too much, my head hurts, my heart hurts, everything hurts. I’ve been spiraling with hard drug abuse and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I told myself I would never touch those substances ever in my life, yet here I am, abusing everything I could get my hands on.

She had blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her. It fucked me up knowing how I was the one she came to at 3am when she needed me the most, the one that I held on right when she had nightmares but also the one who disappeared when I felt the lowest and loneliest. 

I just hope I could call her and maybe hearing her voice would stop me from ending it all one day. Maybe she could convince me to keep living and the pain will subside. But for now, I hope it will look like an accident."
1,"I can’t anymore. I’m just done, I have fought and fought but nothing gets better. I was happy like I was so fucking happy with my life and where things were at but 3 weeks ago everything started to just fall apart, I don’t have a job anymore, The love of my life dumped me and I lost my nan, I thought it was okay because I blocked out all my emotions so I didn’t feel anything for a while but the past two weeks everything is too much for me. The only thing I want to honestly do is die because everything is too far gone to make things good again. I  just want to slit my wrists and be done with it because people are gonna care just for a little while then their lives will go on like normal. I am useless and just a terrible person, I don’t know when but soon I’m gonna at least try have the balls to just fucking end it because there is no point for me to live anymore. It’s only when I feel so sad and depressed that people give a shit. IM FUCKING DONE I CANT FUCKING DO THIS FUCK THIS PLACE AND FUCK THIS WORLD."
1,"Medication and Parents. I [20F] have been wanting to take meds because I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd for 6 years now. I have been on and off meds and in and out of hospitals at the start. I haven’t taken meds in about a year because I still live with my mother and she does not like me taking them. It actually weakens our relationship because of how angry she gets when I have them prescribed. She tells me, “You’ve been doing so well, why the f**k do you need drugs?!” and acts like i’m some monster. The problem is, I rely on my parents to pay for my doctors visits because I only make enough money to pay my bills, and get gas to commute to school (far). Has anyone else been through this? I feel pathetic because I am 20 years old and my mom acts like i’m doing a war crime by trying to better myself. I’ve tried yoga, exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc. Nothing holistic works when you genuinely have a chemical imbalance, what else am I supposed to do? I guess I am just here to find some support or people who can relate.

TL;DR: My mom thinks I’m insane for taking meds for my depression/anxiety/ptsd even though i’m 20 years old and have been going through this for 6 years. It weakens our relationship when she finds out that i am taking them."
1,"I can't accept happiness anymore. I'm at a point in my life where happiness isn't an option anymore. Whenever I feel happy, I catch myself limiting this feeling, thinking I don't deserve it, it won't last and being happy is boring anyways. I feel good, being sad. I feel content with my life, a place of complacency, where I feel too good to change something, but too bad, to ever be truly happy. I feel that sadness gives me comfort in a twisted way. It gives me something to hold onto, something that I feel, if I try hard enough will never go away, unlike anything good that's ever happened to me. At this point I'd rather be sad, than change something about myself. I don't know if I'm making sense, I feel like I'm losing my mind."
1,"I'm just scared. I still live with my parents because I'm 15 iv been depressed since around 11. I don't know how to explain it I'm just a bunch of stuff 
I'm scared for my future, if I'm gona have a good life or be homeless 
My grades are low and it's hard for me to fix them 
My parents usually yell at me because of that eaven tho I'm trying my best to make the situation better 
I want to die but I don't 
I have so many things I enjoy in life, things that I love and are hard for me to leave 
But at the same time I just feel empty and sad
I don't want to die because it will hurt my parents and make them think they where the cause 
It's hard for me to eaven imagine my mom's reaction to my death 
I can't realy be alone a loot so I mostly cry when I shower. That and seeing my body makes me eaven more sad because I don't like how I look it just makes my self esteem shrink 
I have dreams and things I want to do but il never get a chance to do
I want to become an digital artist but I dont believe that I can do it. That and the fact that my country dosent realy put value in art stuff (I'm from Croatia)
I'm also gay and in a very religious family that is kinda toxic my mom and sister accept me but we don't talk about it. I don't think il ever get a boyfriend because of how homophobic my country is.
I'm scared that il be a fail, that I won't have money when I grow up or that I will die alone.
Bearing open to toxic religion from school in 3-4th grade elementary wasn't helpfull. Seeing somebody my age that is better than me makes me fall apart, I had a bunch of mental breakdowns in the school bathroom.aside from that a week beafore the schools where closed a group of guys got a pic of me in the bathroom stall and shared it around the school, that made me stay home till the schools where closed.
I don't know what to do any advice is good."
1,"I feel like I’ve wasted my youth being too depressed to do anything with it. And I’m dropping out of school.. I’ve decided today that after 2 years of repeating first year courses, that I need to drop out of school or else I’ll end up wasting more time and money on something that I’m not even interested in. And it makes me feel like I’ve failed myself, and my parents. 

But I think the worst thing is that I’ve realized recently that I’ve wasted the “best” years of my life, if you can call them that. I didn’t do anything in school but play videogames alone, I didn’t network or make friends or build interests or skills. I’m just the same kid as when I went in, but now I’m not a kid anymore so I can’t even use that excuse anymore. 

I’m going to have to start working again too, once I drop out. It’s just going to make it worse. 

I don’t wanna end up being the guy who’s 35 and works a non livable wage. I don’t wanna be the guy who is too boring to make conversation with. I don’t want to be stuck in a place where I’m in too deep to do anything with my life, but I already feel like I’m there. 

I feel lost, I feel sad, and I feel like a giant disappointment."
1,"I'm a broken shell of a human. I'm 27, but for like the last 15 years, getting worse each day, I resemble a broken, 60 year old widowed alcoholic who has given up and now just sits around drinking and smoking himself to death.

I have not A DROP of energy, or hope, or motivation, or goals in me. Not a drop. All I have is agony. 

I have been so fucked by my brain ever since I was a small kid, that I am literally a walking zombie at this point.

My eyes are tired and sunken in. I can barely keep them open and always look angry/sad. 

The corners of my mouth might as well have weights on them, that's how low they are by default. 

I am out of energy and falling asleep within 11am no matter how much I sleep, how I eat, exercise, and no matter what vitamins I take. 

I CANNOT shake the suicidal ideation for one second no matter what I do. 

No matter where I turn, the thoughts are there. And they will make sure I hate myself so much that I'm afraid of washing the dishes in case I just fucking slice my wrists with that big ass kitchen knife out of despair 

Idk what I'm saying. I'm just laying in bed trying not to cry like all the time, fantasizing I'd get cancer or a brain aneurysm to save me"
1,"I want to end it. I don't have any desire to live. I wish I could just leave and disappear from everything, everyone, all my problems. It would be perfect. I want an escape. As much as this concept is desirable I know it won't actually save me because I'll always have my mind and in a matter of time I would start reciting the same thoughts of feeling trapped with nothing to live for. There's no escape for me. I'm lost, I have no desire to think about my future but the pressure from my family and everyone around me becomes too much. Maybe I'm naive but all I want in my life is freedom and my happiness, however I don't think I'll be able to achieve either. I will never be free from my mind. The only way out for me is death, perhaps not perfect it's either that or live a miserable life."
1,"i need help. I need help. I feel like I'm in a desperate situation. I don't know how to figure myself out. There's less light. About me: I'm just a regular guy 18 years old. No bad habits. I've only got a couple of close friends I can share the most intimate things with. A family where I've been brought up quite freely. But talking about my experiences and feelings in 80% of cases ends in misunderstanding on their part, so I stopped sharing something deep with them. I'll get to the problem. It's based on the choice of future professions. Three years ago, when my peers were deciding who they wanted to be, I couldn't identify any traits and hobbies that might have been prerequisites for my adult life. My parents advised me to be a doctor, because I would always have money for ""bread"" and I wouldn't be lost or anything like that. Their ghostly beliefs imposed on me as a 15-year-old seemed convincing and I decided to get ready to go to medical university ... 3 years have passed. During that time, the thought that I was doing something wrong came to me occasionally. It was a year of passing exams with graduation and other formalities. The results of my exams were average, which did not satisfy my parents and I entered a higher education institution of our regional center, not a decent one. Even though I understood that my university was far from being prestigious, the understanding that my adult life had begun caused an ephemeral feeling of trembling before something new. But after two months of study, I began to realize that the university really sucks, because Russian education is one big disappointment (Yes, I am from Russia). I can tell you about the reasons. I feel devastated by broken expectations and an epiphany from the deep sleep I have been in all these years. I have no desire to learn. Parents try to understand when they missed the moment that everything came to what we have at the moment. I hope I was able to at least partially convey my message to you. I'm not depressed, but sadness and apathy tell me that everything leads to it..."
1,"Experience with anti depressants?. I know they would affect everyone differently, but I’d like to know if it’s worth going on them. I already see a therapist for my anxiety, but I didn’t tell her exactly how depressed I feel (because of the anxiety). 

I don’t know if she would be the right person to talk to about taking anti depressants or a doctor. I’m on the pill, I don’t really get side effects from that (I think) I have noticed some very small things but I’ve been on it for so many years that I don’t know if it’s side effects or just life in general.

Is anyone able to share their experiences with me?"
1,"I have zero motivation what so ever to do anything in my life.... I really wanted to learn photo and video editing, anything to do that makes me feel like im good at sth, i went and downloaded the apps required, and have never even opened them ever since, why? Everytime im like ""no.. im not feeling it"", if i have ever even opened them i close them instantly like seconds after, i really want to exercise, even at home if gym is not possible currently, but i have no motivation at all, i just cannot do it... my brain is just like no, there is no point.

I just go and sit in bed and think about what i could do with my life and whats the point of it.. which makes me even more depressed."
1,"I might just end it now because I am pathetic.. I am living in another country due to my master's degree. I don't want to go back to my country. I landed an internship at a really good company and it was about to convert into a full-time job but due to Covid-19, they told me they can't hire me right now so maybe after this situation settles down. I know for the fact that they will forget about me and the coronavirus situation will go on for a couple more months, I assume. The internship, itself was very hard to get and now all my efforts went down the drain. It's so hard for me to find a job here as to where I live there are less English speaking jobs and my level of the language of this country is basic. I enrolled in the language classes but due to odd jobs and internships, I couldn't complete them.  

I feel like I am pathetic that I cannot get a job. I am a master's student and wasted all my parents' money. Due to quarantine, I can't help but feel even more helpless than ever. I get panic attacks and thoughts of ending it all. My parents have told me already to come back as they can't keep on giving me money. I feel like that I have tried my best and I can't do more than this. I want and need to see a therapist but I was waiting to get a job and then go as I don't have money. I can't even make myself get better. I feel too much or sometimes nothing at all. I know these times have been hard for everyone and I'm not special but I know there's nothing for me even when the virus situation gets better. I hate money and the ones who say that money can't bring you happiness haven't lived a hard or a hungry day in their life."
1,"The universe is against me.. I feel that the universe is against me getting well.  The past 2 years have been hell.  I started into a downward spiral that i couldn't control.  I took an attempt on my life and was hospitalized.  
After starting meds again it took almost a year to get on the upswing again but the side effects took a toll on me. I stayed on the meds until i had a good grasp on my sanity again and went off of them feeling happy. (September)

Now I've never really wanted to have kids (I'm child free) and within weeks of being off of medication I got pregnant at 38. (October). 

I still didn't want to have a child into this mess of my life.  I had an abortion as soon as i could. Because I got it so quickly, i wasn't able to speak to the doctor between having my ultrasound (to confirm how far i was into pregnancy) and the procedure day.  On the day of the procedure (November) i found out i had another large cyst on my ovary. I have had them surgically removed years ago, multiple times.  The cyst was too large to ignore it and the procedure i was having wasn't going to fix it. I had to schedule another surgery appointment for the new year.  

Had the cyst removed and got my tubes tied. (January). The recovery from surgery was 4-6 weeks.  I don't heal quickly so it took me about 8 weeks to feel fully healed.  During my recovery i thought it would be good for me to take a trip.  I love to travel and hadn't done any big trips in 3 years.  Traveling far away from my problems is an empowering thing for me so i booked a trip through Italy (February). 

 I was to leave on March 4th. I got a common flu days before i was to depart anyway so I'm glad i didn't go now as my flight home from Milan was cancelled. (March) The world went into lockdown mode, everyone has to stay home.  I need to get away.  

I find some reprieve when i go to work (gas/oil sector) so i guess that's a plus.  I'm still working my usual shifts (days and nights). i can't help but feel that  everything is working against my getting fully well again.  

I'm struggling right now.  I would normally just write all of this in my journal but i can't seem to find it.  I had an anxiety attack when i couldn't find it so i posted here.  

TNot looking for responses or sympathy.  Just had to get it all out.  Thx."
1,"Why can't things just go right for once?. My relationship with my b/f was not going well so I split with him to work on my relationship with my ex (who I was still in love with).  Three days later my ex was killed in an accident.  

This online schooling thing really isn't working for me.  I just don't have the self-discipline.  I'm so far behind on my uni courses that I am considering dropping out.

My flat-share left, leaving me with all the bills (it's only my name on the lease) and I can't even work because of quarantine.  If I lose the flat I will have no alternative but to drop out of uni and go home where mom and dad will be arguing as usual, still no jobs available and where I can't live as I want to.  

I can't see any positives anywhere."
1,"The Wall. The pain that is inside is being held back by a wall.

The wall is so high it holds everything in

The wall is so strong nothing can get out

The wall is a blanket staving off the outside weather

The wall is stifling but it protects

It protects too well and all feeling is a vague memory

If the wall falls the pain floods

LIke a horrible wave it can't be held at bay anymore

LIke a swollen river crashing and dragging it drags you under

The pain fills your lungs

You try and swallow it but its still there

The pressure on your chest is unbearable and so heavy

You're sure you will never breathe again

You give up

Then the wall rises once more and its stronger

Pain is once again held back

Everything is held back

I'm so numb"
1,"I feel like my life hasn’t started and I want to live it..but it still needs to end. It’s better to be on here, than speaking into the void I guess..
I’m going to be 20 in 5 days, it doesn’t feel like I should be this old though. Ive sworn to end my life on my 18th birthday ever since I was 11. But that day came and went...I didn’t have the courage to do it. So ever since then it’s been this weird limbo state of life...what now? I didn’t expect I’d ever make it here. I didn’t prepare myself for this portion of life. I’ve never had a job, never really been on my own, and I feel life my “life” needs to start. I don’t know how to do that though....I have no one really. I don’t even know who I am. I’m not supposed to be here any longer. It hurts so much. I want this infinite sadness to end. 
Thanks for reading, if you did"

1,"Unemployed for 2 years, A Certified teacher, want to come back to living a full life. Advice needed. Is there hope for me?. I'm a 30-year-old man with a B.A. in education and teaching, my major is citizenship and sociology. I graduated from Uni at the top of my class, two years ago and had a promising future. But my life got messy as soon as I graduated; From a successful, sociable person, a person whom people cherish and appreciate and love, I've become different at 180 degrees.

1. My mom got sick, was hospitalized for two months and I moved to here home to help her. Than she moved back and I needed to stay for another couple of months until the goverment gave her someone to care of her.
2. I was diagnosed with chronic depression (my problem is not the diagnosis but the consequences of it: now my medical records are stained and I will probably not be able to get private medical insurance, take a mortgage and buy a home and have to declare in any workplace that requires a medical confidentiality waiver that I have depression) .
3. I made a mistake and admited to psycaetrist that I smoked cannabis and other things a few years ago and now its registered fact at my medical record. And now i'm afraid that i will have to addmit it to insurance companies and employers for the rest of my life.
4. I thought I took a short break to help my mom and she recovered but I got lost.

I had a very promising future, a bachelor's degree, honors, volunteerism, a good past, I had the qualities of a leader, and I could live a good, good life. I come from a very poor family and I was hoping I could get out of poverty. I am afraid of my future, my parents will have nothing to bequeath to me, my parents live on rent and I am afraid that if my life goes on I will be an aging homeless and without a wife and children and I am anxious for the future.

 All my life, I took care of myself and built myself without the help of anyone. With money no one could help me or help me, only I promoted myself and was proud of myself for it.

I already want to find a job and develop a career, but I am ashamed of my last two years. How do I explain that I did not work and was unemployed for 2 years! Whole 24 months? How do I protect myself? I'm very worried because I don't think any self-respecting institution will take a 30-year-old who hasn't worked for two years? I would be happy to advise."
1,"People make my day even worse... I went to work this morning and my older co worker said do you do you have a part time job ? i said no. And he started saying ""When i was your age i worked 3 jobs"" secretly saying how much of a loser i am. and it is true i am lazy and a loser i barely work one job. I just wish i had enough money to be free."
1,"How to stop being frustrated ?. Depressed since im 8 yo (dad beating the shit out of me and my brothers, being really mean and my mom never cared bc my dad has the money, got raped got raped when I was 6yo and shit, looked ugly af so i got bullied for this during my whole scholarity, and I'm weird), I've always been negative, and I've always hated everything but I never realised it was a problem until now.  I'm just a ball of hate, frustrated of everything because I hate my life and myself, , I hate being like that but this is anorched deep within me and I feel like I can't change, I had some friends (not a lot...) when I was in High school, but I just kept a few of them, and now I'm at university, I'm 20 and I can't really make new friends, I guess it's because I'm too toxic, I'm a loner so I wouldn't probably go out with them but just knowing that some people like me would give me a little bit of self-confidence, but I guess I'm too bad of a person to have friends which is the main problem here. 

I feel like on the outside I'm a hateful piece of shit but insidide I'm quite kind, I don't like hurting people anything like that. 

By the way I'm french, so sorry for the bad english and if you're american our uni are much more individuals than yours."
1,"Can someone be proud of me?. Please?

I don't have anyone to tell so I guess you guys are all I've got, to be honest I prefer it that way.

Today I got up before noon, got dressed and actually brushed my teeth (something I've had trouble with) and opened my curtains.

My agoraphobia has always stopped me leaving the house but now quarantine is doing it for me. But I'm happy I did something.

I'm still lacking motivation to shower, self care has always been difficult and I'm still debating whether I should eat. Kind of disappointed. 

I'm happy for myself.

I hope you are doing well, too. Stay inside :)

Edit: grammar mistakes"
1,"Emotionally numb. Over the past years, I’ve been gradually being emotionally numb. The things I used to love, I don’t anymore. It’s like I forgot how to love. Not just that I don’t feel sadness or happiness.  People think that I’m sad on days, but no I’m not. It’s just that I kinda don’t feel emotions anymore."
1,"The people I can't find. The bar is buzzing. Camera flashes are bouncing off the bottles behind the bar. A stack of speakers are shaking with the sonic treats of the top billboard hits. The stool under men feels like it was sharpened by Vlad.

A pretty girl is chirping from the stool next to me while flipping her hair between her fingers, but I can only watch the door to the bar. Somewhere out there is some one worth talking to. Whoever it is, they sure as hell aren't in this place. They aren't dancing on the hardwood floor. They aren't throwing back mixed drinks, trying to recapture the carefree moments of youth. They are out there, somewhere. Doing what? I wish I knew.

I stand. I leave the bar. The warmth of my bar stool made evident by the cool air now making me overly aware of my own backside. I dust myself off. How long was I sitting in that bar. It doesn't matter. I'm out. I'm walking. I'm searching the night. I knew I couldn't stay with those people, nice as they were. I have to find my own kind. The people that wake at night."
1,What are you supposed to do when you don’t really want anything and don’t have any goals in life?. I feel no passion for anything. My interests have slipped away the longer I’ve been depressed. I used to want to be a doctor. I used to dream about getting married and finding someone to love me for me. I don’t truly want anything. No short term or long term goals. Nothing to motivate me. I wake up to get through the day and get to the end goal- being able to lay in bed and sleep again.
1,"Anyone else about to snap?. I'm sure a lot of us are in this situation, but anyone else about to snap?  


1- I don't care about isolation, I tend to be a lone wolf anyways, not having to deal with people in person is fantastic.  


2- I'm very very very close to putting a bullet in my skull. So here in Canada we have something called EI ( employment insurance ) and CERB.   


I've spent the better part of Oct onwards (Until around March) being unable to work due to a shoulder and ankle injury. I went into Jan telling myself that I can finally work again and not starve myself each month, then all this bs hit.  


Now because I didn't work, I'm not eligible for either the CERB or EI. Ditto for 100's in my situation, students etc.   


3- I've lost track of how many things I've punched this last few weeks. I know my knuckles are bruised up and me usually being civil and patient and friendly, has gone off the deep end and is about ready to put said bullet in my head. As a bonus, my counselor ( who is amazing ) can't work due to all this shit and it'll be a very long time till I find someone like her again. 

  
So who's with me and wants to completely snap? Our respective government have shown they don't care about certain people, so why should we abide by their bs and stuff when we're the ones getting fucked over?"
1,"I am so fed up with the people in this world.. For so long I’ve felt so empty. Nothing in my life seems to give any worth, nothing feels like it matters. 

I get a girlfriend, I still feel empty. I get friends, I still feel empty. I try and work on myself, AND I STILL FEEL EMPTY. 

The worst part of it is the anger though. I feel so angry at the world. Everyone is so stubborn and selfish. No one cares about each other anymore, maybe they never did. They don’t treat me with respect, they don’t treat others with respect. All they seem to respect is themselves. I swear to god I’m going to snap one of these days. 

When I was younger I used to think I was always the one that was wrong. I was the pathetic one, the stupid one, the weak one who would never amount to anything of worth. After years of this crap I’m done with it all. I’m not what’s wrong, the world is what’s wrong. Have we all gone crazy or something?! 

All life is, is building insecurities in the weak people, tricking them into thinking their lives will actually amount to something of value when they achieve what they’re missing out on. My whole life people made fun of me because I couldn’t get a girlfriend. Then when I was finally able to get over my social anxiety and talk to girls it didn’t even fill that goddamn hole in me! Everyone is awful, absolute fucking garbage. I am too, but at least I can see it. 

Lately this desire has been growing in my mind. Thinking about what it’d be like to have so much power that you can literally end everyone all at once. So many pathetic lives thankfully put to waste in a second. That’s all they are, just trash."
1,"Is shooting yourself in the head just the ultimate method of suicide?. I don't think any other method holds the same reliability,  ease and speed of a gunshot to the head.

Sure it can go wrong, but so can the other ways and none are as simple as just pulling your finger a little.

Hanging is so gruesome and doesn't look quick, and what if you get it wrong? The beam the rope is attached to snaps? So embarrassing"
1,"Am I just self diagnosing?. Hello.

I've noticed a lot of differences between 15 year old me & 19 year old me. I know as we grow up our perceptions, views & thoughts also tend to change, but I don't think mine falls into that category of 'change'.

 When I was younger, I was very ambitious, confident, determined & I knew what I wanted. Now, it's the exact opposite. I don't want to do anything, I don't have any interests and I can't help but think how meaningless life is & how much I hate being the person I am. I just feel like I don't deserve the life I have, it's too good for someone like me to live it. I always feel like a burden to people & I feel like everyone hates me (not that anyone ever said anything). I feel like they just treat me well because they're stuck with me & there's nothing they can do about it.


My brother had studied psychiatry & he was the one whom I could talk to openly. However, he told me not to label myself under those big words. So I have stopped talking to him about it.


 A day won't pass without thinking about death & how everything would've been better if I had never existed. I used to beat myself up, but I have stopped cause my body is now used to the pain. Also, I can't feel sympathy nor empathy anymore. I don't miss anyone, I don't love any one, the only emotions I feel are anger & disappointment. So it's hard for me to connect with people & I'm very isolated, like I get introvertion but mine has passed the line, I couldn't even attend my brother's wedding cause I was afraid to do something stupid & embarrass him & afraid of people judging me. On top of that, whenever I feel a tiny bit happy I feel guilty cause I feel like a loser like me doesn't deserve to be happy. 


So please let me know if there's something wrong with me or I'm fine & just making this up. Cause I genuinely can't tell if this is really happening to me or it's all in my head. Is this normal or I'm just overreacting?"
1,"""WARNING"" Novel of doom ahead. Finding me!. Since birth i was given away, the only girl to my mother. She kept my brothers. I was raised with different types of people, family, to strangers & even friends. It was horrible! My upbringing was AWFUL, mentally, emotionally, sexual abuse, abused.  Nobody loved me. I ended up with my 1st child @ the age of 16. I didn't know what I was doing, thought I was in love forever, til he cheated on me when our son was 3 months old! I threw him out of my life & moved on to an unstable mother & found another guy to love, I gave birth to our daughter. Her father was crazy, abused me most times well pregnant, ran away from him with my kids @ the age of 17. His family took me to court for my son & our daughter, they spoke lies about me, they wanted me to stay with the crazy son. They found me & my kids were ripped away like a lit match stick! I'm more lost than anything at this point, I'm trying to do right for me but everytime I failed because I didnt care no more. Drinking & smoking weed made me happy, help drown out the pain! 2yrs later I'm 19yrs old, I met a guy who's 16yrs old. I couldn't help but make myself known to his presence @ a course we both attended. We eventually made out & stuck together for 10yrs & in that 10yrs we had 5 kids. My life had changed dramatically from LOST to settled, I gave birth to his 1st child but my 3rd. After hrs in labour, we had him for 30mins till his passing, the most difficult part of my life. Losing a child in my opinion is worse than the abuse & rape I've had to endure. A week after his passing, the father had gone back to work, he didnt cry or realize he had gone. 1st day @ work he was hospitalized, fell from a 2 story building shattering his right arm. After all of this, he started to abuse me so bad, I still stayed with him & gave birth to the rest of his 5. He was in & out of jail constantly for abuse, I was having to deal with Child Youth & Families until 1 day they we're uplifted because I let him back into our lives knowing he was abusive & a high risk to almost killing me so many times. I put my kids at risk, even with drinking around them. I've never known what LOVE or how to trust the person you love. I'm very hidden with how I can start something out of nothing, the jealousy towards another female or anyone getting close to the one I love is A NO. My upbringing I blame for that. After them been uplifted in 2014, I'm definitely drowning in SHIT, don't care for nothing or myself. He ends up in jail a few months later, 2yrs he's doing. I'm on the outside waiting for him like a dumb cunt, in 2016 I found someone on facebook. Wasnt looking for love, he was someone that attended the same school as me back when I was 13. We end up talking little bits, he started to get at me on a daily its unbelievable how I'm here 5yrs later with him lol. He's born on the same day as the one in jail, in different years. We're also 3 days apart on our birthdays. He came across as a narcissist, It was unbelievably difficult for me. I found so much connection to this guy, I couldn't let go. He was not my type but the bond was strong. He has a daughter, I've never been in a relationship with a guy who had a child, so it took a toll on me to accept it. The fact I had to make room for someone that he showed a huge amount of love for, made me feel jealous. After spending time with her, I started to accept her more, I actually loved been there for her because I didnt have any of my own kids with me. She gave me hope to motivate myself to see my kids. 3yrs into our relationship we had a son my 8th child! His daughter went to live with her mother, it's best she did, she was depressed with us. I couldn't be that mother figure to her cos she loved her own mother. Today is the 15th of April 2020, my eldest boy will be 18 this month. My 8th child has autism, I'm still with his father. I'm 34 turning 35 in August this year, I'm heavily depressed, never spoke to anyone about my troubled life. Drunk it away, laughed it off & forgave so many that did me wrong. I suffer from anxiety attacks, I feel as if I'm slowly dying. I'm too young to die & I have so many things I want to do as a individual women, I'm highly motivated but I know my partner will feel insecure about me wanting to get out there on social media. I gave up smoking in October 2019, never have I quit smoking before thanks to my major ANXIETY ATTACK! I've also cut back on drinking, thanks to my trip to the hospital with a liver issue. Now I'm plain, with so many things I want to do. I have low self esteem due to weight gain, my confidence has stepped up to 60% my inside though feels tired, for years I lost my purpose & myself. These last few months I've been searching for me, I've found bits & pieces. I don't want to waste anymore of my life doing what others want of me or giving others what I think they want! I get to see all my children (heart is relieved) reducing stress. Lazy, which is a good thing, I suffered & still suffer from OCD. I have major health issues but tests say I'm healthy. It could be my mind overthinking. I'm praying someone or anyone could talk to me & tell me it's ok. I often think of the homeless & all those suffering in other countries that are asking for miracles. If I had any kind of high power, I'd definitely do my best to save as many as I can. Its who I am as a person, caring for others even if they committed a crime I can't hate. I pretend to be tough out there but hurting any living thing breaks my heart. I hate that I can't hate the people who raped me, it makes me hate myself so much. I'm a follower but I know deep down i can be a good leader, if I found who I am. Thanks for letting me share my NOVEL of doom. Never shared a briefing of my life before with strangers! Oh well I feel it may help since I couldn't speak to a counselor due to my anxiety attacks."
1,"I’m coming out as depressed??. I posted to my various social media about my depression. For me, this was kind of like a victory letter. It’s me saying that I’m not ashamed of my depression and I’m getting help. I don’t want it to control my life. No matter what is going on, we have to have hope that something better is coming along. Right?

For reference, this is what I posted:


Depression. It’s a bitch. 
It took me to the brink of life and death in 8th grade and now again when I’m 21 years old. It wasn’t supposed to be like this and I felt disappointed in myself for so long for not being able to “fix myself”. For those who have reached out to me, thank you. You may think that saying hi was insignificant, but your notification was literally the only light in my room sometimes. And those who didn’t, how could you have known. I’ve always been ashamed of my depression. I’ve always tried to hide it behind smiles and jokes. It made me feel better momentarily. But I always ended up feeling alone because I had no one that knew the real me. And I’m tired of that. It took a lot of courage saying this, and even more courage to get help. But thanks to the wonderful people supporting me I’m able to stand strong. Starting today, I’m going to be living fully and un-apologetically me. It took me a long way to get here... But I’m happy to say that for once in my life, I’m looking forward to tomorrow."
1,"Trapped. This could be difficult to explain but everytime I get into a spiral of depression my mind makes every day conversation/interaction almost impossible, not through want of not trying but because somehow your brain has completely shut off that ability.

Has anyone experienced this situation where their whole vocabulary is restricted to just a select few words and feel as though their brain has just shut down?
P.s. even when I try and get into a conversation my sentences are muddled (further reinforcing this idea my brain is giving up?)"
1,"I don't know if I have depression.. Hey people, here's a thing I wrote tonight about my... 'situation' I guess? It's my first post, so sorry if it's bad. I hope to help anyone else who feels the same to not feel alone. 


I don't know...

I don't know. Sometimes I know and other times I'm not really sure. Is this whole thing just fake? Did my brain create this story for me to believe so that I can feel some sense of certainty, or that I can feel that I'm 'special' and people should pity me? Do I cut only so I can think ""only someone with depression would hurt themselves on purpose, right? So I must have depression, right? Right?"". is it lying to me, like everyone says it does? Sometimes I'm happy, briefly, and then it reminds me of everything and my smile fades. No one notices, though. But those were genuine smiles. So I can't have depression if im smiling, right? If I felt happiness? Oh, someone did notice. They asked me if I was sad, and trapped and scared in the moment, I said ""no one will ever know..?"" stupid. Fucking stupid. I didn't want to lie but I couldn't say the truth. I'm such an idiot. That's literally such a stupid thing to say. And then my dad noticed. Trapped me in my room and asked if I was OK. I said ""yeah, I'm fine, I'm always like this."" so stupid. But I didn't know if I have depression, so what if it turned out that I didn't and people laughed at me and judged me and called me a crybaby and a wimp behind my back? I'm only 13, so I have nothing to worry about right? Nothing to be sad about? It would destroy me. Because it's true. And that's what hurts. I don't know who I am, what I'm supposed to do. Just school, and feeling nothing. Wake up, stress. Go to bed, emptyness. No emotion. Just stress. Brief happiness. Sadness. Self-hatred. The feeling of being lost. I want to cry but if I do people will hear me. Fuck. I'm a wimp. A loser. No one actually likes me, how could they? WHY would they? So many questions. No answer. I'll never get answers. It'll constantly be this feeling of being trapped. A cycle. No motivation, but I have to act OK, otherwise they'll give me that piteous look and ask me questions I don't want to answer. Because if I don't have depression, they'll hate me and say I just want attention. They'll hate me more than they already do. But I laugh, so I'm okay. Right?

I... I don't know.

If you got this far... Thanks. It really means a lot to me."
1,"School is the root of my problems. I didn't realise till now that school was making my depression and anxiety SO much worse. Here's the pattern that made me realise:

School year starts - suddenly I think about suicide every night as I try to sleep

School holidays start - suicidal thoughts become less overwhelming and less frequent

From the FIRST DAY school goes back - intense daily suicidal thoughts return...

I always knew school was having a very bad effect on my mental health, but never put anymore emphasis on it than other things that cause me stress and depression like relationships, the state of the world, etc...

The sad thing is even when I'm not at school and have relaxed thoughts I'm still not happy. There are NO circumstances in life that will bring me happiness.

1,"i don't think i'm a good person. i don't necessarily think i'm evil either... but i think my overall contribution to the world is negative (or at least not exactly great) i say stupid shit... i know i've hurt people. i've had so many friends that treated me like shit and i'm starting to wonder. am i the issue? have i been the problem this entire time? i find myself becoming more bitter by the day... i snap at my boyfriend and i'm becoming more and more apathetic about it. i used to feel crippling anxiety about things like this but it feels weirdly okay to accept the fact that i'm probably not a good person. i've tried but usually i am more selfish than i am selfless, even though i TRY to help people. i am trying to be better but i find it extremely exhausting and i can't help but be a bitch most of the time quite frankly. but by putting my own interests above everyone else I know it can be shitty to deal with. i fantasize about driving off the cliff by my house all the time... when i finally get my license i think i will do it. it's this great big chasm that probably drops hundreds of feet. it's a nice thought."
1,I just want the pain to end (21F). I don’t have purpose or drive or any positive qualities. No one loves me nor will anyone ever love me. They know I don’t deserve love. I can’t take this emptiness. I’m already slowly dying.
1,I've only been working 2 jobs for a couple weeks and it's already crushing my soul. How the fuck can people think doing this is okay or normal? I just finished working a 15-hour day with a total of ONE TEN MINUTE break at my second job. Open to close. I've only been working two jobs at once for a couple weeks now and it's already draining me and making me want to die even more than I already do.
1,"My head. All of my thoughts are negative or far-reaching desires of mine. I've realized the only emotion I truly feel is pain and exhaustion. I don't give a fuck about getting help from family or friends. I hate almost all of the people I see in my daily activities. I want a partner, and now that we're in quarantine, I find myself fantasizing about this want much more. The emotional pain one feels in their chest has become normal to me, and I now enjoy it in some way. I believe that all people have the opportunity to change, just not me. I'll always be the quiet guy, the pushover, the shut-in. I think about killing myself a lot, and I think I'll do it another time in the future. Not tonight, nothing surefire. My standards for a partner are disgustingly high for a person such as myself, and I find myself angered with my own sense of entitlement. I want to kill myself. My head is filled with some sort of white noise, a mixture of phrases and negativity. Nobody without issues of their own wants to be with someone who has such mental problems. My mind longs for it. I wish to meet them one day, though I know I'm not active enough to find them. They don't exist anyway. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and act normally. I want to meet them, though I know I won't. Can't? I want to, though. I just wish. I don't really like this post. I want to get diagnosed, but I'll just be met with ""mind over matter"". I mask it too well, maybe it's my fault. I don't wanna express anything aloud."
1,"I’ve lost everything. It’s my first time really doing this, but I thought it’d be best to at least share my feelings. I moved from my hometown and left everything behind. Not possessions, but my relationships that I had cherished so very much. I lost all of my friends, my best friends that I had been through thick and thin with for years, that I called family. But the one that has hit me the worst is the loss of my girlfriend. We broke up because of the long distance between us, and that has made everything so much harder. I have no one, and I don’t feel happy in the slightest. All I feel is just pain, and her and frustration because not only am I such a failure, but I’m all alone. I’m all alone and being alone is so depressing for me. I think of suicide a lot, especially since I keep all my thoughts to myself and never vent to anyone. I miss what I had, and I wish I never had to be in pain so much, all I want to be is happy. That all I want."
1,"I keep dwelling on the past and worrying about the future and I can’t stop.. I keep relapsing because of this and I literally can’t help it either, people always tell me to stop dwelling or worrying but do they realize I can’t do it? It’s too hard for me. I’m basically having relapses because of a thing that’s out of my control and it’s so painful. Nobody understands that I can’t just simply live in the present. I wish all my suffering could just end. I don’t wanna die, but I don’t want to keep living the way I’m living but I can’t do that. It’s a never ending loop."
1,"#lost. I feel like I'm fighting myself and loosing. My head is just above the surface but I've essentially been drowning for years now. And no one gets it seriously, and even if someone did, I know no one can help.  I've been up and down but the main thing that has happened trough these years of sadness and self doubt is the fact I've slowly been disappearing. And not so much in other peoples lives, altho that too, but in my own mind. I remember less, feel less, know less, am myself less, have less hope,  zero will and energy. I feel hopeless, and not even in the same cliche way that everyone around me seems to see, but in my core. I hate it. I've come to truly discus myself. Bit of background, I am a 24 year old girl (altho i don't feel like much of anything). I graduated graphic design in 2018. I have a messy but loving family, a home. Finally I think I found a decent guy that loves me, as oppose to a sea full of assholes I've been with so far. As a little kid I was pretty shy, and a smartass, which as you can assume lead to a fair amount of bullying. I rarely had real friends. We moved a lot. So I assume it makes sense I was an introverted kid, alone, in the books etc. But I grew up thinking I had it, the courage to shrug shit off, the brain to see above and beyond the little petty world I lived in, and big brave heart ful of love and dreams, sure I was gonna grow out of the shit and show everyone I was actually great, and just rock on. Reality is, that kid in me feels so disappointed, it gets hard to breathe let alone stop myself from crying. And my mind just keeps on rambling and going over and over the same shit, while I slowly lose every pixel of what I wished I was."
1,"How to stop defaulting to lifes challenges with suicidal thoughts?. I am getting worse.  It's like everything leads me more and more to thinking about how the pain is personal, permeant and pervasive.  I cannot see light at the end of the tunnel.  The more I go there the more worse it gets.

(Note to self identify triggers)"
1,"I want to get to suicide. I can’t stand this purgatory. Neither here nor there. I have a dull feeling of being fed up with life 24/7. I feel broken and I want to give up. I loathe the human experience. I understand the right way to be; take responsibility for my life and build myself up to be strong. I truly hope others can manage this for themselves but my self is gone. Every day I think about suicide but I call myself a petulant brat for even going there in my head. It’s like any concern I have for myself, any compassion is immediately shut down by the cruel voice. How do I take it further so I can kill myself? My personality is absolute garbage. This sucks and I want it to end. I have no identity, no future, I can’t love, people run from me understandably. I want to end it!"
1,"Music that hits hard when we are down and why we listen to it. Hey everyone,
I'm someone struggling with depression since five years and have been lurking in this sub since a year or so. I've figured I won't be able to help anyone since I'm busy enough with my own thoughts, but I might as well post something interesting on here. Depression is a disease that tends to affect people with above-average intelligence, due to the fact that smarter people often overthink and/or start questioning themselves, life or even existence itself. 
I made a playlist and wondered why are we so obsessed with sad music, when listening to happy music would be the most logical thing to do. 
For anyone interested, my playlist consists of sad songs I listen to when times are difficult.
Link:
 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVw

First of all I gotta say that music is not a cure for depression and can even affect you in a negative way. The Playlist is just somthing I wanted to share.

So. Why do we like sad music?

When we listen to music we feel understood. We can see a glimpse of ourselves in the artist or song, that conveys the same emotions we feel. We feel better about our situation when we believe that someone else has experienced something similar and understands exactly how we feel. More importantly it validates our thoughts and makes us feel human and normal. At the same time, it allows listeners to bring their own negative emotions to the surface and vent them out, thereby reducing tension and stress.

Why do we hate listening to happy music?

As stated above, happy music would be the first logical thought at first, but often we do end up feeling worse than if we hadn't listened to happy songs. The best way to put it would be to compare both happy and sad with humans. The sad one is the understanding one who went through the same and is trying to console you, while the happy one is a annoying guy who always smiles at us and tells us to just cheer up and be happy.

Why do we like sad songs even when we're not sad?

Who in their right mind would choose a song that could heavily mess with their mood when there are happy alternatives out there?
Simply put is happy music often boring and fake. We as humans can't feel happiness for a extended period of time and get annoyed after a few songs.
Sad music is more moving and we connect to sad, romantic or even angry topics.

Effects of sad music on us:

""One might suppose that people become pessimistic when they’re sad; however, one research study proves that people are actually more realistic when they’re sad. This is due to a phenomenon called depressive realism. Compared with happiness, sadness has been observed to encourage more detail-oriented thinking and less judgment bias in people. Listening to sad music is believed to induce depressive realism, encouraging more realistic assessments of the likelihood of certain outcomes.""

1,"It’s 3am and I can’t let myself fall asleep because last night I had a bad dream. Well.. the dream was actually a good one. It was waking up that was bad. I dreamt that my old best friend was still alive. He was at his moms house and he had only faked his suicide. The dream was SO vivid, it was so real, when I woke up it felt more like a memory from yesterday than a dream. I knew it was a dream thought and it send me into a spiral of unanswered depression questions. Did he mean to die? Could I have prevented it? Did he want help? Etc

I wish I had a time machine."
1,how to not be suicidal when youre not on drugs and the sobering reality of resentment hate and anger come to take over your consciousness??. when i wake up tomorrow it is gonna be rough. my brain has used up a significant portion of its gaba reserves through phenibut. ugh. i am annoyed
1,"Do you ever feel like doing nothing?. Sometimes I just want to do my homework, but then whats the point of it anyway if I'm gonna kill myself later anyway? Then I realize I'm too much of a coward to kill myself because I know I would be tortured in hell because of everything I did. I want to talk to my friends about my depression, but I dont want to act needy or burden them to the point where they leave me."
1,It feels like I’m floating through life. It feels like I’m floating through life. If that makes sense. When I walk it feels like I’m not in my body but floating above it. It feels like a connection that’s almost fading. The world is blurry. Especially when I’m finally outside.
1,"I'm pretty much done.. I tried, healing myself, helping others and all that shit but i just don't understand, wtf am i doing wrong? Everyday's getting worst and worst, i become more numb, soulless and apathetic. I just want this to end, only my doc knows how many meds I've tried to get better, everyone thinks depression is a flu or a fever that with popping more pills it'll go away, no it's not how it works i just wish people just stop being assholes, ig it's a good thing I'm numb, cus at least i don't have to worry about anything or anyone hurting me. I'm truly done, just a breathing flesh, no purpose no future no dream nor hope, just waiting for death."
1,"Just wanna vent and see if it has happened to anyone else. Because of depression I've been struggling with discipline and motivation in college for a while now. I've already changed from a double major to a single major because of them. On january/february, after more than a year of monthly therapy, daily medication, self improvement books vids and articles, and a lot of trial and error, I really was getting the hang of it. Going to all of my classes, studying daily, not procrastinating. For the first time since I entered college, I felt good about how I was handling things.

Boom, pandemic, quarantine. No more classes. I had no crutch anymore, no calendar to follow. No more sport to vent. No more therapy. Things went to shit quickly. 

I'm several weeks behind in almost every class. I've missed a lot of assignments and classes because I just wasn't aware. My brain feels foggy once again. My father told me that if this semester doesn't go well, he's gonna get me out of college and put me to work. I should be so determined and full of activity but my brain doesn't seem to care anymore. This is just a shitty situation overall."
1,"A poem about insomnia and depression. It’s 3 in the morning once again.
I’m up and overthinking like I always do.
My patience with myself is running thin.
I hope that I don’t completely destroy you.
I’m no angel I love to sin.
The devil has something in me he’s beginning to brew.
You won’t see it coming till only then.
It will leave you cold, alone and blue.

It’s 3 in the morning another night.
I wonder where these evil dreams come from.
My angels and sleep paralysis are putting up a fight.
You sill stay with me even though you are completely succumb.
The room goes dark but my head turns on a light.
My whole body goes numb from the tip of my tongue.
All of me is screaming as I lose my sight.
I’m tied down to this bed but I need to run."
1,"Nothing feels right, and everything feels wrong. It's a weird feeling, but most of the time the feelings and emotions during depression don't make sense"
1,"Who else is just keeping themselves alive for their parents?. I love my parents, which is why I need to make them think I'm happy. I'll make them think that everything in life is going perfectly. Then, when they die, I can finally be done with this world.

Who else feels the same way?"
1,Suicidal thoughts.. Some nights im really struggling not to take a bottle of pills and slice up my whole body and just die. I hate myself so very much and i’ve just come to the realization nobody gives a shit about me and nobody ever will give a shit. I’m always the happy one helping others and talking and cheering them up but in reality i want to hang myself. The urges to cut are extreme and I just want to slice open every inch of my skin until all i feel is the sting and pain. I get bad urges to the point where i can feel it on my skin so i dig my nails into my arms trying to alleviate myself with the pain but its not enough. I need to cut.
1,Why the fuck am I such a piece of shit. I hate myself so goddamn much. Why am I such an awful person
1,an update. still lonely as shit the voices are worse now and now i see things and i wanna die even more
1,"I just don't want to be alive anymore. Simple as that. I've lost my faith in everything and I reached my lowest point in depression again. I just can't see meaning in anything and I can't see hope in the future it's all like a deep dark tunnel without an exit. I've been depressed for a really long time and I'm tired of living like this. What's the point of living if you're feeling dead inside every day? What's the point of living when you're alone, not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard you try
I wish I was brave enough to end my life but I'm scared of attempting suicide and failing again but in the same time I just feel so suicidal and I can't go through life like this anymore. Bro I can't take it, I really can't, I swear"
1,Anyone?. Does anyone else’s family taunt and bully you about your depression and self harm
1,"Seeing shit again. So Ive always had trouble sleeping. Whenever I try to sleep I see, hear, feel, and smell things that aren't there. Voices tell me that someone is in my house or they impersonate family or friends. Hands and bugs start bothering me, and I start seeing figures and shapes. 

Because it's been getting worse I havent slept right in almost a week. It's 5AM and I just went downstairs to get a drink and I swear to christ there was someone in my living room. I saw them, I heard them, but the moment they were no longer in my line of sight they vanished. Now I'm hearing shit and paranoid, and I'm starting to feel like I'm just fucking losing it.

This place makes me miserable and I have every chance to just disappear to somewhere else but I dont take it.

Sorry if this makes no sense I just need to put it out there"
1,Depression sucks. I feel like no matter what my depression is always gonna remind me of how much I want to die
1,"It DOES get better... but then it gets even worse.. Life is a cycle. You have a good day after a myriad of bad ones or vice versa. Just logically, it does get better. But, with the same logic, it gets worse.

Happiness is not eternal. Neither is sadness. Life is living with the constant cycle of good to bad and bad to good. 

So then, is life worth living just for the good ones?

I don't know."
1,"I hate School. I hate school

So I randomly started thinking about when I was in Year 7 ( In UK, currently Year 10). But anyway I have low functioning autism which sucks incredibly( I’ll get onto that later), so I had been at this pretty good school that worked you pretty hard and the week before half term I was basically just talking with my new friend of about 2 months, and we were just joking around on the bus when I lightly slapped him on the face, anyway I thought nothing of it and we continued talking until we got to school. When we got there though a Year 12 I think came up to me and said why did you hit ____, which I was confused by and basically just went to class. Later in the second class of the day the lower school headmaster( or whatever weird title he had) came in and took me out of class, and I was completely confused, but he said that _____ had gone to the nurses with a red mark on his face( he wasn’t in my class btw) which I knew was total bullshit as I hardly touched his face but then as I have low functioning autism it basically means I lose complete function over my body and I said I wanted to kill myself and the teacher was complete shit at handling it.

Fast forward a few months and I basically developed anger management, depression, etc. and I was still at the school getting in for about 2 hours a week and feeling like utter crap. 

Then just before the first Christmas of Year 7 and I moved to another school which was honestly great, I mean I had loads of friends (actually good friends this time) and I was seeing a counsellor at the school and I felt slightly better about myself. Then after two months the counsellor, who was fully confidential, literally reported my dad to the local council as he was mentally abusive to me and I needed to tell someone so I told them, so thanks to that shit show I lost all confidence in that school and moved on.

I then had a few day trials at schools and did a month on an online school which was terrible.

Then in the Easter term of Year 8 I went to another school, for a term long trial, and I enjoyed that again and it was ok apart from the end of term when it felt like no one cared about me and I basically just walked out one day ( because I wanted to go home so I went to the office were they were supposed to call my mum, they refused and so for pretty much 2 hours I sat on the sofa by the office until I just couldn’t be fucked and left) then on that same my mum went for a meeting and the school said they wouldn’t take me back next year and I cried and was incredibly depressed for about a week.

I’ve now found a tiny collage with 6 people in a class that’s literally meant for me as I was the first student there, and while it has its ups and downs it pretty good and I’ve actually been at one school for almost two years.

Honestly though just thinking about how one person saying that I punched them has basically ruined 3 years of my life and possibly will affect my adult life, it just makes me annoyed and depressed which is why I felt I had to get it out of my system.

Hopefully this is the right place to post it, but if not can someone tell me what the suitable subreddit is."
1,"What I feel. I feel like nothing in my life is going the way I want to and I know for a fact nothing will for me. Heck I’m just 17 I haven’t really tasted what the world is like, but so far what I have experience is really something I don’t want to be apart of. I’ve felt like like happiness isn’t a thing for me and won’t be. At this point I think being happy is fake. I’ve been through so many hard days having nothing good planned or wanting to chase anything that would make someone happy. I really don’t know if I can pull my shit together and get through myself."
1,"My thoughts part 2. I really attack myself and destroy my own happiness. 

I'm worthless. 

I compare myself to others so I can put myself down. 

I keep my head down and my voice shut so I become a walking ghost. 

Everything is wrong with me. 

Other people learn from their mistakes. I tend to repeat them. 

As the seasons change, I stay the same. 

I'm weak physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

I want to be worth something. 

I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. 

All the moments in my life led to this. 

Excuses are half the things that come from my mouth. 

You are disgusting. You are fat. You are worthless. No one would want someone with self-harm scars. You are damaged goods. Broken, and not physically. You complain about the dumbest shit and you're always ready to attack, even though you don't need to. You self pity because it's easier to accept than the truth that you're a dumb cunt. 

I want to ruin the opportunities before me so I have something to complain about. 

I'll never be satisfied with who I am. 

My emotions shouldn't rule me but they seem to be both king and queen. 

I liked to be walked on, overlooked, picked last. It reminds me of who I am.

Maybe I just wasn't meant to be in the end. 

I wish I could learn but you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

My brain tears itself apart without my help."
1,"i wish i was a cat. i would be cute, fat (and not care), and get all the cuddles and attention that i want. instead i’m stuck in my disgusting, depressed and anxious body. i’ve struggled with depression and anxiety throughout my entire life. i just turned 21 and i don’t understand how i’m supposed to keep pushing through it. my only relief is drugs and alcohol. i’m a musician and full time student and i am under constant pressure to perform well and every season is full of gigs that i need to play and practices i have to be at. i’m so exhausted and sick of my life and i desperately want to be someone else. i dont even feel like my mind is connected to my body anymore. my voice sounds disembodied, my reflection is not me."

1,"Idk what to do. A couple months ago I was having a rough time with life and I was getting to be super sad. I thought nobody could love me and I always felt alone even when I was with my friends and family. Then one day this girl texted me and she thought I was cute, but I guess I got too attached to her and drove her away and she didn't like me anymore after a few days of talking. After messing that up I was super depressed and wanted to kill myself because I felt like I had no place in this world anymore. Then I got a text from that girls friend and she said she wanted to talk because she felt bad that her friend did that to me. I've been talking to that girl ever since. About a month ago I found out that this girl really likes me. It's been amazing and I've actually felt loved for the first time in years. But for the last couple weeks I've had this overwhelming feeling that she isnt gonna be there forever. I really like her and want to keep her around but I'm worried that she will leave and I'll fall back into the deep pit she pulled me out of. She saved my life and I don't think I could let her go if she left me."

1,"My dad passed away 3 days ago to Covid19. I can't seem to believe my father isn't here anymore. Even if we were never close because of things that happened between me, my mom and siblings, these last few years I tried to change and just let God guide him to a better path. We became sort of close the past 2 years. But I never got to say I forgive you. Never gave him a hug without feeling awkwardness now I find myself crying every time I remember all the promises we made together and knowing he isn't opening our house door anymore. He wasn't the best father in the world but he was the only father God gave me. I tried to be his friend...he was so lonely and I felt sad for him. His actions made no one want to get close to him but I felt bad for him even if for years I resented him...I always felt bad. I miss him. 

I still hope this is all a bad dream."
1,Can’t sleep. Does anyone else feel awful when you accidentally have an okay day?
1,"A cop stopped me from killing myself last night. A bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. I just feel like I have nothing and no one to live for. I’ve been really struggling lately. The people I count on to come and talk to when I feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so I’ve stopped bothering texting them. The only girl I’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. So I stopped texting her as well. No one bothers checking on me so why should I reach out to them? My aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. And my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. I was seeing a therapist but stopped because I couldn’t afford it. They care more about money than the health of their clients. America summed up in one sentence I guess. 

I dropped out of engineering school in October after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because I just didn’t wanna do it anymore. I was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. I may or may not go back. My student loans are due starting in June which I can’t afford. I have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that I never wanted in the first place with money that I don’t have. I only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which I much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. I just absolutely fucking hate being told what I can and can’t do with my own damn car that I pay for 100% myself. My car is my therapist and my favorite thing that I own. I’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. I cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. It’s been a month since quarantine and I can’t really even leave my house. Can’t have a social life. Just feel like I have no one to turn to and I’m drowning. Every fucking day and I’m just done. 

I left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. I waited til my family had all gone to bed, then I got in my car and just took off. I drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. I eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. I got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone I felt. I was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when I heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. I knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. I just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. He approached with a flashlight and noticed me. Apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. He was a young guy, probably about my age. He asked for my license and registration which I gave him. I’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and I think he picked up on the fact that I seemed a bit off. He asked me how I was doing and what I was doing so far from home at this time of night. It was like 1 am at this point. I just said that I needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually I admitted that I had driven up here to kill myself. 

I thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. He asked why and what was going on in my life. He even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. I had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how I felt like I had no one. He didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. I eventually said I planned to drive my car off this cliff because I was so unhappy. He was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. Apparently he came close to suicide a few times. A quote he said really stuck with me. It was “Sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” And it hit me that that was exactly how I felt. He gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if I needed to talk. We sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. It was so nice to just vent to someone. 

Eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what I just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. He walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. He walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. He followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while I got on the entrance ramp. I drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. I never even got his name or badge number. 

I got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. I snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. I gave no indication to my family that I tried suicide the night before. No one knew that I went out last night. I still haven’t told them and I don’t plan to. They have no idea that I could’ve died. I called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. He texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. I have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. Everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. 

It’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, I don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. His compassion saved my life. It’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. He deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. I owe him my life. Cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. We wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. I don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. I could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. Not a bad idea. Godspeed officer. I’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it."
1,"When you’re sinking in a deep pool of water but don’t want to self-rescue. Don’t know if anyone else shares this same feeling or not. Everyday when the sun sets, I just feel like sinking in darkness. Lonely, hopeless, desperate to quit the depressed feeling. Then I realize this has already been happening for a year already. I sit in front of a computer. When I’m tired, I stand up and eat. When I’m tired standing, I lie on the bed and imagine myself sinking deeper. Keep wondering if I actually want to survive if I’m drowning and falling deep down the dark sea. 

Probably I still want to be rescued. But unmotivated to make myself survive - when I know there is not going to be anyone coming to rescue. Another tired and sleepless night."
1,"Why do I hate this. I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they aren't physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I'm in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I'm 6'2"", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I'm so fucking depressed.
I told my parents that I haven't been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.
I only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.
I drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I'm actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.

Please if you're not actually depressed don't say you are it's people like that that make me not come forward and people that don't recognize depression as a real condition"
1,"Hey guys, just wanted to share a few thoughts that I've written down before earlier in the year.. It's a lengthy post but hopefully it makes you guys feel better by not realizing you're alone. I'm gonna make a part 2 as well. 

&#x200B;

My first mistake was learning to speak, if only I were born a mute. 

I got used to being made fun of that I started to do it normally in my mind.

My brain is so broken that negativity is my one and only normal.

Talentless and below average in a sea of those who will always be better than me. 

One mistake can lead to others that feel like a slight burn. I'll continue to make them until I'm completely engulfed in flames.

Yesterday was great. Too bad those days are so rare. 

My feelings are toys to be played with and then forgotten after some amount of time. 

My mood is bound to change in an instant to negativity so that I may be comfortable. 

Do I conform so easily to others opinions or do I take bits and pieces from others? Either way, they never feel like my own.

I want to satisfy those at my own dissatisfaction. 

Why are we cursed with lives of self-doubt, contradicting, and hateful thoughts?

Wanting to always be right about failing, I will sabotage myself if doing well or flat out refuse. What a disgusting creature I am.

Why is that whenever I'm happy, depressing, and negative thoughts come by the multitude? Like a woodpecker at a tree, they pick at my brain until they're in and settled. 

Suicidal ideation was once my full time job. 

I want to say I'm sorry and that it's all my fault, although I'm not quite sure what for.

We're all hypocrites to some degree or another. 

A time for everything, but mine has been mostly sadness. 

To believe I was once complete and not broken into tiny little pieces. 

Don't hate me. I already hate myself. 

After wanting to change for so long, it's finally here. Now that it is, I want nothing more than for it to go away. 

I was never the lion like I wanted to believe. I'm the dog in the corner, whimpering and cold, only wanting to love and be loved back. 

I can look past others deformities but not my own. 

I can forgive everyone. I just can't forgive myself. 

Instead of overcoming my problems, I succumb to them. I want to blame someone for that. But everytime I look for that person, I end up looking in the mirror.

Never improving. Always failing. The essence of who I am."
1,"Happy pain, I guess. TL;DR at the end

I just did both the worst and best thing I have done in a long time. 10 months ago I met a girl. I uave never had a better relationship with anyone ever. We never dated, we were just good friends. However, I did develop feelings for her, in fact, she is the first person I've ever been in love with. I had a girlfriend when we met. I decided to dump her to be with this girl. I never shoot my shot because I was too scared to do so and, well, we never became anything more than good friends. 5 months ago she started dating someone. Every other night I've been crying myself to sleep since then. I never stop thinking about her and I tried my best so we wouldn't drift off and stay as friends. Nothing I did worked, and we ended up hardly ever talking, only when she felt like shit. I tried to kill myself again month ago and she called me up. I told her how I felt and she pretty much told me to stop being a dumbass. Today I told her that it would be better if we never talked again, and even after being taken off my meds by my psychiatrist and not needing therapy anymore due to being well, I have not felt this shit in months, yet I know this is better for me

TL;DR I was in love with a girl, we drifted apart, tried my best to save the relationship, still fucked it up, told her we shouldn't speak anymore, and even though it hurts like hell, I know it's better for me"
1,Hate when people ask if I’m ok. Why do I get embarrassed/defensive when people notice I’m struggling or ask if I’m okay even though I Lowkey want them to notice? Ugh it’s so weird
1,"Can I hop in the boat too?. This lockdown has really been getting to me too. It's been getting to me, even if I'm a less cynical of a person now.

It definitely reminds me of my childhood where I had very limited friends since I was sort of this emo nerd who got along with everyone but was never really kept around, no matter how hard I tried. I've had contact with a few of my close friends, but I've been wanting more than the sporadic texts or the very rare phone call. I've been sort of falling into the routine of getting up, writing or drawing, cleaning, reading, studying just for the hell of it, and exercising. My dogs passed away last year, and they were the only reasons why I felt anything and the only reasons why I stayed home after college.

I can't ask my family for support since they keep telling me ""millions of people are going through the same thing"". But are those millions of people suffering related to them? No. I get it, people have it worse, but I'm allowed to feel the way I feel. I had a lot of time to research my own psyche and why I am the way I am, and it sucks really bad. I miss working so I can distract myself from those thoughts, and the thoughts of returning home feeling like I'm not good enough. Feeling like I'm a failure for being 25 and not being financially stable enough to make rent in Hawaii, where it costs a fucking kidney and liver to rent a shitty ass apartment and have a car, even with another person. I help out as much as I can at home, but it never feels like enough. I thought I was going somewhere with my life. I had huge plans.

This is the first time in a very long time I've let my feelings out since I always felt like I was being a baby when I did. As long as I can remember, I've kept my feelings to myself because when I was a kid it was always ""Don't get upset."", ""Why are you getting mad for?"", ""There's no reason to be depressed, it's all in your head."", ""You can't hang out with these decent kids you like because I don't know or like them."" So as a result, instead of being resilient like I thought I was throughout high school and college, it turns out I've just become an overly-critical, avoidant, closed-off asshole who kept her nose in books instead of trying to make meaningful relationships. I'm still trying to work out how to maintain friendships, maintain a relationship, and not distance myself the moment I get too close to anyone. I think I might be so closed off that even words can't help me at this point. Yet, I still miss people.

I didn't even ask to be born, as ungrateful as it sounds. I thought I was getting better, too. It might have just been my imagination."
1,"i feel like i can only enjoy life when im obsessively vain and my ego is huge. ""I am extremely attractive"" ""everybody wants me"" ""I am smarter than most people"" 

If these conditions are not met, then I feel like I just want to die. Having a huge ego is the only way I can escape my pain. It is quite the opposite of pain. idk what to do. Phenibut makes me feel this way, but I cant take it alot because it can be harmful, but it gives me the illusion that I am strong enough to cope with life. It makes me focus on the good things."
1,"Can’t even sleep anymore. After realizing how bad life was getting I was loosing sleep, I thought it was normal and I read about it a lot. After a month after me not being able to sleep I realized this is getting bad. I sleep 5 nights every week and it doesn’t sound that bad but it is horrible considering the days I do sleep I fall asleep at 12.

I wake up at 9am and am tired as fuck. I tried lucid dreams and tips on how to fall asleep. I know this might not be the right subreddit or whatever but I don’t know how to sleep. Anybody have advice?"
1,"I can't stop hating my life because I'm not as rich as my friends.. To begin, I'm a 20 something med student. My family is not poor but we're not doing that great either. But due to being in med school I'm being exposed to a lot of flexing (both intended and unintended) from my classmates. This is mostly because a lot of the students here have medic parents, and are therefore pretty rich. Cool cars, newest phone, expensive PCs, expensive clothes.

Now I don't really care about phones and clothes, but seeing them drive cool cars and play the newest games hurts me deeply, as both of those are big passions of mine. I love cars but my parents can't afford to buy me one, and med school doesn't leave me time to get a job. I also love gaming but all I have is a crappy laptop and I can't afford a better one right now either.

Due to all of this, it pains me when we leave class and almost every friend of mine hops into their car while I walk home or they give me a lift. Same when my friends talk about such and such video game while I sit there thinking what 2002 game I should play.

Now, I know what you're (probably) going to say: Some people have it worse. And I agree. But here's the kicker. A lot of people also have it a lot better. Some dudes my age drive million dollar cars and have the most expensive shit, and I can't help but hate this life for being so unfair and wondering why I wasn't born rich too. And nobody seems to ever think about how quite a lot of people have it so much better, instead focusing on the people that have it worse. And that whole ""Money does not buy happiness"" is just a tactic for rich people to keep us simpletons from rioting against their evil thiefy asses and settle for the leftovers.

This also brings me to another issue: I hate rich people with all my broke-ass heart. I have rich friends and they are nice, but it seems like most rich people are complete assholes. And it irks me how some dudes flex their wealth even though their parents are rich, not themselves. But still, their life is a lot easier and more fun. And I hate them because of my envy. This poisons my soul and makes me a bitter person.

Again, I would love to work and buy the stuff I want, but I really don't have time for a job. Med shool is quite hard, and not even the quarantine makes it any better since I still wake up early, still study, still partake in classes and lectures (online) and still have assignments. I don't know what job I could possibly sneak into my schedule since I have like 2 free hours daily. And this is not bullshit, I'm down to try anything if you have suggestions.

Every day, from when I wake up until I go to sleep, I hate my life for being so mediocre and unfair. Please help me stop being so materialistic. I'm sure there are lots of wise people here that could guide me and save my soul. This thing is ruining me, it's really bad. It clouds my judgement and makes me hateful. But no matter how hard I try, I always come back to my mindset of ""Why should I bother working my ass off just to MAYBE have a fraction of what other people lucked into at birth? Why play the rigged game? Life is unfair and I shouldn't bother since I was unlucky at birth""

Please help me get rid of this mentality. I know I'm a hateful piece of shit that doesn't appreciate what he has, but I want to change this."
1,"Idk. Yesterday I took 12 shots of vodka.... and I don’t drink. I always think it’s gonna help my depression and it always makes it worse. Not to mention I can never sleep even after it’s worn off, like rn it’s 4 am and here I am, typing this. My bf caught me cutting in the shower... and... do you ever just want the sun to come up? I’ll be able to make bacon & eggs then. It’s all about little things like that I think."
1,"Below Rock Bottom. This is a bit of a rant so I’m sorry in advance.

Since January I’ve been at the lowest point(s) of my life. I felt so empty and lifeless that I placed an expiration date for myself, on March 15th if things in my life hadn’t gotten better I would have killed myself by jumping off of a bridge a few towns over. Things got marginally better and I didn’t have the inclination to go through it on march 15th, but two weeks prior to that date I slipped mentally and tried to sufficate myself in my bathroom. I think I knew it wouldn’t work but I was hoping it would. To me that was **ROCK BOTTOM** and I’ve been doing so poorly since then. Between then and the date I orginally chose to kill myself, I picked up vaping nicotine to deal with the feeling of unworthiness. The date approaching was traumatic and so was already having attempted to kill myself. Shortly after, and having quit vaping, I was forced to move back home from college. At this point I feel like I’m below rock bottom. I am beyond depressed. I can’t feel happy which probably is depression BUT I can’t feel sadness either, it’s like i’ve been devoid of emotion which is extremely unsettling and concerning."
1,"What the hell happened. I don’t understand what is wrong with me 
How can i go from so happy one day to feeling absolutely miserable less than 24 hours later. Why do the things that made me happy no longer make me happy. Even things that I liked a few days ago. Why is my motivation gone. What happened to my happy thoughts, or even my semi positive thoughts. I had a lot of hope for the future and I can’t find it anymore . Why do I feel so worthless now. Why do I feel like a failure now. Why has the progress I made suddenly vanished."
1,"Why?. Why do the things in our life happen? Why can't we control what happens to us, we are like dust in the wind... why do people die? Why are we here..."
1,"I thought I was getting better but this quarantine has proved me wrong.. For a while I thought I was handling my depression pretty well and that I was on the road to getting better, but this covid lockdown just destroyed all of that. I feel absolutely hopeless, panicked, and I dont feel like doing anything at all. I cant make myself do my school work or hardly get out of bed. I just dont find any motivation or reason to do anything anymore. I don't have any distractions like school or trips to the record store, online school is absolutely horrible and stressful due to the pressure and my trouble with understanding without hands on help, I feel more alone than I ever have, I cant do a single thing without my stepdad screaming at me for no reason. I cant even go on walks to get excercise because of the shitty neighborhood I live in but all the gyms are closed. All I'm doing is rotting in front of a screen and eating like shit. I just want things to go back to normal so I can distract myself again. No one knows when this quarentine will be over and that's the worst part. I'm not sure if I can take any more of this. I don't even know what my career future will be. I was going to go into the medical field but now I'm rethinking it. I just dont really know why I'm here or where I'm going anymore. Everything just feels so redundant and pointless. It's the same thing every day. I try to be optimistic but I just cant see a light at the end of the tunnel."
1,Finding happiness in pets. Has anyone ever bought a pet so they could have a companion that offers unconditional love and to essentially be their rock? What with quarantine restrictions and all I feel like now is as good of a rine as any to get a pet (while I'm home full time for a few months) so I can spend the early part of their life with them every day. I absolutely love dogs but feel like that's a bit of a big responsibility to take on considering the training it needs and the fact that I live in an apartment. Any cat lovers out there feel like their cat is their bestfriend and saves them on their down days?
1,"I wish people understood why the , ""Your family will have a terrible life because of you"" argument is not helpful to someone considering suicide.. Obviously a suicidal person doesn't want to hurt people in most cases. Its just that the weight of the nothingness outweighs the pain of others. Its always about someone else, and never about the person with the problem. ""Oh, you're suffering, but too bad, other people need your ass and it doesn't matter how you feel."" I just don't see how people think piling on more guilt and responsibility to someone already struggling is a good idea."
1,I am desperate...... my family isn't helpful. I am not happy just want to end myself but too afraid to
1,"Some of us can’t be saved.. I think after 20 years of this shit it’s probably time to throw in the towel.  I’m not talking suicide, i’m giving up on looking for treatment.  I think in the time i’ve been trying to get help i’ve probably tried almost every med out there and the end result is that not only am i depressed but i now have a long list of permanent side effects that make my life even more miserable, something i had not thought was possible.  It’s honestly rather amazing that nothing seems to help the pain.  Hell, i even tried drinking depression away only to find that the more drunk i got the more i hated myself.  

In all honesty, I would have taken a long walk off a short pier years ago if it weren’t for my family.  There’s just something so uplifting about having 6-7 members of your family tell you (at different times) they don’t want you to kill yourself because it would make them sad.  I’m sure they thought they were helping in their own inept way but really, all it did was drive home the fact that my whole life i’ve been an utter failure and all i’ve ever really done is hurt and disappoint my family.  So as much as i would love to become intimate with a bridge abutment.  I’m stuck here in my little hole, it’s the one thing i can do that won’t disappoint anyone or cause me more pain.  I have no idea why the fuck i’m posting this, maybe spreading the misery around will make it feel better."
1,".. Misery. I experience it first hand. Second hand. Third hand. It surrounds me. My light has dimmed to nothing. It’ll never rekindle. Nothing on this god forsaken planet is worth being here. Voices screaming in my mind. Sleep. It’s the only escape. Death is eternal sleep. Doesn’t sound bad. I can’t focus. Where did my life go? Shit, I don’t want it. I want to end it. And I don’t care if it hurts."
1,"Vitamin D. Hey! I wanted to share a story in the hopes of maybe helping some people. So I have major depressive disorder and have struggled with it all my life. I was having a pretty bad episode after not having one for years when I went to the doctor to get some blood work for an unrelated reason. It turns out that I was severely difficient in vitamin D. I was perscribed pills, and they have had the biggest impact on my depression that any medication has ever had. It's like night and day. I'm currently going through a breakup that came out of nowhere and I'm actually doing ok. If you live in an area with overcast weather or rarely leave the house and don't get sun, I would ask your doctor about it, or if you can't do that just try some over the counter stuff. It's not a miracle cure even if you do have a difficiency, but it could really help."
1,"Feel hopeless more each day. I [22M] wish I was never born into this shitty existence of a life. Not one day has gone by where I can throughly say I'm happy with my life. I'm in debt, banking on a degree that might get me no where, making 9 dollars an hour, I have no life outside of work. All my friends are over the internet. No one makes plans with me, no one stops by to see me, no one cares. Even if they did my life still sucks. I'm just genuinely at the point where everyday becomes more a struggle. I have to take medications to feel normal (have anxiety disorder/ PTSD) . Im constantly having mental breakdowns. I hate where I live but I have no way out. I can't afford to live somewhere on 9 bucks an hour. So I'm stuck here. In hell. I hate my life everyday and the idea that it's gonna get better somehow as if all my life's problems will be gone just isn't true. As time as went on in the past decade it's only gotten worse. My moms on the brink of death with her drinking addiction. My mental problems are through the roof. I feel so helpless. 

 I've been getting mental help for almost a decade now and it just feels like my depression can never go away. I'm so nervous that once I graduate college that job I want won't be there... Im going to college for my dream job. I've always wanted to be a journalist or something to do with writing, talking about sports whether it be a reporter, news station , just something with sports. The only things keeping me going is I know I'm pursuing my dream and what I love to do. But I'm so scared that once I do get my degree that job that I've always wanted won't be there and my degree in journalism and mass communications will be worthless :(. I don't want to be a failure"
1,"i thought i was above thinking this way. but now i realize how naive i was to think it was possible to be “above” depression, “above” suicidal thoughts. before this i was always in charge of my feelings, and i thought it was just how the brain worked. you recognize your emotions and you control them and you act on them. happiness, sadness, anger, fear; it’s *your job* to control them, and if you can’t, then you’re failing. that’s how i always thought.

but now i fucking swear my depression is totally in charge of me and i can’t regain that control. it doesn’t just make me cry and mope, it completely changed the way i think. i lost my level-headedness that i was always so proud of. my depression keeps me up until 5 am and wakes me up at 8. i’m so tired that i have to drink tons of coffee but i can’t eat a bite of anything without feeling immediately nauseated. so all that’s in my system is caffeine, all day, every day. always jittery and anxious and in cold sweats. i feel like i’m some form of walking depression.

i never thought i’d understand how some people could be moved to suicide. i know i have things and people to live for. i know i have people who love me and who’d be devastated if i really did it. i always felt a little anger for people who so readily expressed their desire to die because i know it costs so much for the loved ones of suicide victims. 

but like i said, depression controls you. it makes me think differently about suicide. yes, i would devastate my loved ones by killing myself. but, as insensitive as this sounds, i wouldn’t feel the guilt of hurting them. i’d be dead. besides, they’d overcome it. they would mourn me, miss me, some longer than others, but it wouldn’t kill them. they would learn to be strong and they would finally take me seriously enough learn from my mistakes. i know i have a lot of life ahead of me right now. but do i? “it gets better.” says who? who’s to say it doesn’t get worse? every time i’ve been in a low place, it gets “better” just long enough that i let my guard down. then it gets bad again, seemingly worse each time. i reassure myself sometimes by picturing myself happy, with a family and tons of kids. that’s my dream. but why should i believe that will happen? i can’t make someone fall in love with me. not everyone finds love, and that’s just a fact.

it just seems it’s very possible that i’m suffering like hell right now because i’m holding onto hope that it will get better, when i could just stop."
1,"Mourning my past, childhood, and broken dreams. I’m very very emotional right now, even the sight of children’s movies make me cry. I just keep crying. I’ve always been emotional but lately it’s been getting bad. Whether it’s music or visionary i cry at certain things... memories... all of the above"
1,"What the hell am I supposed to do with my life when I don’t want to do anything. I’m gonna graduate highschool in like a month. I already got into college but I don’t know if I even wanna go. College looks like fun but at the same time I don’t know if I would even like it. And I’ll be damned if I’m gonna get a degree so I can work some dumbass 9-5 every day. I don’t wanna work at a pizza place the rest of my life either, which is the job I have now. I don’t wanna have a job at all so how the hell am I supposed to decide what to do with my life? I feel like I could do whatever I want but I don’t want to do anything. 

I just wanna sleep half the day and spend the other half watching tv with my dog or something for the rest of my life. But I live like that now and I don’t like that either so what’s the point"
1,Help?. I'm having a rough time. I'm just so sad  and I don't know why. I just want to get better for my children and myself.
1,I’m callous. Idk why maybe because people and the world suck and this is my way of showing anger. Sometimes I feel like just ending it so there is one less person for everyone to deal with
1,"I can’t tell people I’m sad because I don’t have the right.. I was on the verge of tears and my boyfriend asked me if I was sad because I sounded sad (were in a call, we fall asleep in a call every night.) and I said I was just tired because it’s 1am, it’s believable. In reality, I’m really hurt. I’m really really upset. I just don’t think I have the right to be sad or upset because my life isn’t half as bad as others. My parents are together, they at least act like they care. we’re decently well off so I have a lot of luxuries in life that I know others don’t have. I have an amazing boyfriend. I get a lot of things that I want- to be quite honest I could have easily become spoiled the way I’m growing up. 

I literally do not have the right to be upset. If my life is perfectly fine then I should be too. I feel so worthless - which I also don’t believe I have the right to feel. I don’t have the right to feel any emotion other than happy, yet here I am. I only try to show people me as a happy careless loving person. Yet here I am probably considered fake as fuck because in reality I’m super sad all the time and just can’t show it because I risk losing or hurting people. I’m worthless. Ha. Ha. Ha."
1,"Slipping into drugs but don’t want to leave. So I’m gonna keep this short and sweet. Been smoking weed and drinking alcohol for 2-3 years to cope with shit. Has it really helped? No. Will I/ can I stop? Also no. And this virus shit hasn’t helped. School was the only thing keeping me productive and now the only time I get up is to get more drugs. I have now tried many other drugs, basically anything except coke, meth, and heroin. 2 days ago I was walking around my neighborhood, tripping on dxm and weed when I ran into a garbage can. I fell on the ground and didn’t get up for 30 minutes straight, wallowing in my own self pity. Just wish something else was worth doing."
1,I hate myself so much and I feel so lonely all the time. I haven’t felt like this in so long. I smoked tn when I probably shouldn’t have and now everything I have kept bottled up for months have just come back. I can’t talk to anyone because I can’t get myself to be comfortable to open up with anyone even my girlfriend who I don’t deserve. This quarantine has made it all worse because this is my senior year of high school and surrounding myself with friends has always been a distraction whether it’s at school or just hanging with my friends. Now I’m alone all the time and all I have are these sad thoughts. I don’t know what’s gonna happen when everyone goes to college and I’m stuck in my hometown at community college. I’m gonna be so lonely. I just want to truly be happy without these sad thoughts in the back of my head all the time
1,Can’t even isolate in peace. My life is terrible I have no friends no irl friends for months and my online friend cut contact with me not sure y I’m completely alone the worst part is that I can’t isolate in peace my mom and her boyfriend had a fight he started with me saying he was going to fight me for no reason lasted all day cops were called and because of the virus they can’t kick him out he knows this and abuses it saying more things constantly trying to get me out I went to my dads for the week too more fighting it’s driving me insane I can’t even feel safe In either house virus shut down my job nor money to move out I have no one and it’s hard I don’t want to get up to hear more fighting or I am woken up to it I’m losing myself and my thoughts have gotten darker each day I thought I wanted no school but it’s the only thing that got me away from home now I’m stuck and I can’t deal with it anymore I’m the fight my step dad destroyed my pc I o my have my phone and no other way to take my mind off things there only so much you can do on your phone honestly I don’t think I’m going to make it out of quarantine
1,"My dog died yesterday and I feel like a part of me died with her. So I live away from my parents and I didn’t get to say goodbye to my dog. I was hoping to see her this summer.

Right now I feel like a shell of a person. I don’t feel human. I feel numb. I feel empty. I feel like I’ll never be happy again, and that nothing will ever make me happy. I feel like nothing that used to make me happy or content, like friends, food, books, movies, video games, etc, whatever it is, could ever make me feel whole again. I used to love baking and cooking and eating, but now I have no interest. And I can’t be with friends now because of Covid. I live alone. 

I’ve talked to my family over the phone about our loss, but that won’t bring her back. Me eating a lovely piece of chocolate won’t bring her back. 

I want her back. I want her young and healthy again. I want to tell her that I love her. I want to see her running around joyfully. That’s the only thing I want. Knowing that I’ll never get her back makes me feel devoid of everything except loss.

It hurts. I feel it in my soul. A piece of me is gone forever."
1,"I am splitting at the seams and I can't do anything about it.. I am breaking apart and I am constantly on the verge of either screaming in anguish or crying and I have no control over my life right now. Usually that excuse is bullshit but I have lost any control over my life with this pandemic and it's hurting me. My college shut down and I don't have the resources to do it online at home but they don't give a fuck so I will just fail, my job has cut my hours and I can't see the few friends I do have because no one is allowed out. My life is shit and it is putting me in a hole and now I can't do anything about it. I don't know what to do and I'm so tired of waiting for the day when it will be better and I can do fucking do something that will make a difference."
1,"""I'm good."" I say with a smile.. Is what I do everyday at work when my coworkers ask me how I am. What I really want to say is that I've been seriously depressed for the last few weeks if not months. I don't remember.

I thought I was getting better. I've lost over 150 pounds. I look good. I get hit on and flirted with a lot. I have someone falling for me, I'm falling for her. Yet, I don't feel good. 

I'm not happy, but I should be. Everything in my life is going great. College, work, my relationships. But, I feel so insecure about life. I'm afraid of losing it all and just having it come crashing down on me. 

I don't want these feelings anymore. Why am I experiencing these feelings so strongly. It's as if life's ocean is crashing into my soul and I can't seem to escape the current. 

I'm drowning. But I don't want to reach out, I don't want to push all of the people in my life away from me. I'm scared of losing them, of losing her, and she's not even mine. 

So I'll just keep saying ""I'm good"" and I'll smile. And I'll keep making them laugh, making her laugh and smile and bring happiness into all of my family and friends life, because they deserve it.

I'm okay with drowning in my thoughts, and thinking that one day I'll be happy, waking up next to the love of my life. But I know deep inside that I'll never be good enough for anyone."
1,"Unsurprisingly, being isolated at home is terrible for my mental health. I do not like being alone with my own thoughts, prior to this pandemic, I spent the minimal amount of time home alone as possible. I study in the library or in coffee shops and I eat in cafeterias etc. I also maintain a lot of friendships. Unlike a lot of people, I don’t really get much out of entertainment media — I’m not a fan of most TV shows, movies or video games. I can’t be satisfied to sit at home and watch Netflix or read books all day. 

All that is to say that this quarantine is extremely hard for me. I can’t focus on anything and I feel quite depressed. I spend much of my days sleeping in order to avoid being alone with my own thoughts.  I’m sad."
1,"I’m fucking sick of everything. Everything I attempt to do, I’m garbage at. Social interaction, trying to play video games, being a productive human, mattering to people, being attractive. Literally anything I try to do for enjoyment I end up being garbage at. I’m just sick of everything and want this all to end"
1,"Is it really that bad?. Usually I feel really lonely during my day,but lately I haven't felt like that,in fact I don't really miss having someone with me because I already forgot how it felt like to have a friend with me or something like that,all I do is stay in my room all day and feel little to nothing all the time,I don't want to suicide that badly anymore,but still it didn't solve the problem that I can't really live in the reality I am part right now,I am only ignoring the problem"
1,"Hey, I’m not that bad but i want to let you know anybody can change. I have African parents and i always am pushed to do my best, and i do but if it doesn’t work out then i take the fall for something everybody does. Don’t get me wrong i love my parents without them i can’t even stand to look at myself because i know if i was worthless i wouldn’t be put through multiple rounds of being pressured. I play soccer, i’m the best on my team and i carry them to the state cup final every year. But if i lose in a team sport with ten other kids i rely on i’m in trouble. 

I try my best but if your really struggling(i’m not hopefully you aren’t ) you need to speak to a hotline a family member or somebody else.

In all truth i think suicides wrong life can always change, we have one life in infinity, don’t throw it away on this. No matter how scared you are of the reactions it’s better than just leaving forever. I know that’s not what you wanted when u were first born. 

So please whatever’s getting you down can always change. I know that when i get depressed all i do is think about what i want to be i break it down into a plan and have multiple backup strategies in the event of failure. If u make it somewhere i applaud you but if not remember that not everything was done at the first try.

I thank u guys for even reading this i’m signing off for now i hope i can change some lives for the better"
1,"Independent. Livng alone sucks so bad. 

I wish I had a healthy family that i could stay with as long as i could.

I moved out when I was 17. And ever since I got my own place it's been nothing but working full time and stress. I feel I have no one and cant shake the feeling of being pushed aside by everyone. I've isolated myself to the point where my only real friend is my ex that left me. I'm such a bother to everyone. I don't wanna start school bc then I'd have to cut my work hours which would stress me out even more, but I'm already 21 and cant put it off anymore. I just wanna leave, I'll never be anything anyway, there's nothing here for me.

I hadn't cut in years but recently I've relapsed so deep to the point I had to get stutures for them, idk what to do

Tl;dr just a late night rant."
1,"BotW. I'll never be anyone, I'll never matter, I'll never BE. Things just ""aren't"" anymore. I've been thinking about self harm and suicide but, I don't wanna hurt my mom. Nothing makes me want to try anymore, before quarantine I used to be so passionate about academics, but online school is murdering me and it takes nearly everything out of me to get it done. I, just want to give up, I only have 2 people who truly care about me, my mom and my best friend Xander, he is the only one who knows I'm depressed and he helps me through things. I'm also just angry at the world and I'm filled with so much hate towards society and people. I don't understand why some nothing like me gets to be a nothing while everyone else is happy, it's not fair. The only things I enjoy anymore are watching Swagkage and SethTheProgrammer (they are Narutubers), play Rivals of Aether with Xander, and play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I just bought the DLC for it and I've been enjoying the new outfits the DLC comes with. Well anyway in the comments don't say ""feel better"" because I know you little retards are just saying it because you feel it will make you morally better, it won't. It doesn't help. Also if you read all the way I don't see why you did. I'm nothing, I don't matter and I can't see why you even bothered to take time out of your pitiful existence to listen to this."
1,I’ve lost myself I don’t know what’s next. It seems I’m nothing and I feel nothing and I try to feel I try but I give up
1,"Have you ever thought it?. Have you ever thought about how there are hundreds of thousands of people that will go their entire lives without a suicidal thought, and hen there’s us?"
1,"Starting therapy during covid... I’ve come to the realization that I’m depressed and need therapy/maybe medication. I’m open to trying anything. But I’m not sure how to go about trying to find a therapist during this. I looked through my insurance and I have a few therapists I could go to but they’re not offering in person or online therapy. Are there websites or something I could do telehealth therapy on?

I’m out of college so that isn’t an option but I do have insurance."
1,"I literally can't even tell what's real or fake anymore. I've been abused on and off throughout my life, so gaslighting is nothing new to me. I'm so full of hatred towards myself that when I start talking bad about myself in my head, it's just another person. I call her the bitch in my head because duh. 

I've been trying hard for years to think more positively, like instead of saying ""I want to die"" I'll try to say ""I don't want to die, I just want to stop hurting."" But when the bitch starts saying horrrible things, like ""You're such a terrible person"" I can't say ""no, I'm not a bad person"" because that's exactly what I'd say if I was a bad person. A  bad person would deliberately play up their suffering to make themselves look like an innocent victim so they could do no wrong. What if that's what I'm doing but I'm so good that I even fooled myself to I think I deserve saving? What if I've subconsciously tricked myself into thinking I'm innocent? I can't tell. I don't think I could ever be able to tell.

 For all I know, the bitch in my head is right about everything and I ought to just kill myself to save everyone else from me. But then again thinking I matter enough at all for people to be afraid of me is so arrogant. Who do I think I am? Why would anyone notice me, good or bad? I'm just starting to spiral now into this infinite loop of hate. I really, really don't want to die, but for the love of anything remotely holy, I can't keep living like this.

TLDR: existence is agony"
1,"How could I know you when this is about me?. Everything I do is dumb. I'm delusional.

I'm making no effort to get better.

I want to save something incapable of being saved.

I am less.

I am nothing.

Pain lives in the comparisons.

The perceived shortfalls, possessions, feelings, importance.

So deserving.

Never listening. Only telling.

Strong, and never wrong. Never. I was wrong then, but not now.

It's the body that's weak.

Ensnaring Life forever. Mine.

Pamper my existence. I have standards.

Deserving of existence.

Pain?!

Why me? What makes me so special?

All of existence and it's about me.

Ego?

No, not me. Way better than that.

Low self esteem.

I'm grounded.

Here on the ground. Where I'm should be.

My choices:

Appreciate the experiences

or experience the misery.

...

I'm incapable of being satisfied with my current life. It's not possible.

I must reach my destination.

I won't accept anything less.

Meaning misery is my only choice.

...

Unless I remove the chooser, the judgement,

The ego.

Time is not waiting.

But Life is"
1,"My mom might push me over the edge.. I’m so tired of being In this house, my mom does pretty much nothing but get in my nerves, I can be completely fine one minute, then she comes In and starts yelling at me for the stupidest reasons, I wish I could say certain words to her but that would make things worse, I was completely fine today, I told her I would do my school work, yet she comes upstairs and yells at me for not doing it, even though I fucking told her I’m gonna do it. Sorry I’m getting off track, but basically I feel fine I e Minute then my mom does something stupid like that, and I just loose it, I loose control of my emotions bc the shit she does to me stresses me out to a point where I have no control over my emotions, I wish I could leave, if anything she’s gonna be the person who makes me end everything, she doesn’t know how to help, she overreacts and is just a bitch most of the time. I wish there was somewhere I could but there isn’t. It’s not like I can leave bc I’m only (male15) but still I want to leave, who know when I’d leave forever, but there’s a chance it’s gets to that point, I’m so tired of the life I life. I only have a few things that actually make me happy. I really don’t understand why my mom does shit like that, it doesn’t help me, it destroys my mental stability, I can’t control myself, and my emotions. Yet I still hide all my emotions from her, bc if I tell her how I feel she won’t help, she won’t know how, she’ll make things worse. I’m so tired of being In this house, I want out, I want to go, I’m want to give up, I have very little left, I can barely see the light at the end of my tunnel. I’m so broken, everyone I talk to says the bad things are temporary, yet I can’t see them letting go anytime soon if ever.all this shit is tearing me apart, I don’t know how to feel anymore, I do t know what to do. I’m want to give up, but I know I would hurt my friends and my family if I did that, but it’s still an idea......"
1,Want to die...... Want to die per usual. Anyone want to help me? I’d like to vent to someone. I’d prefer someone whose understanding/ a good listener. Thanks.
1,"Nobody needs me.. Some days I feel like I'm doing okay and maybe I can deal with this. But some days... fuck me. On top of clinical depression, I have severe anxiety and PTSD.. My family lost our house in January and I moved from FL to AZ to be with my boyfriend and not homeless. But no matter what I do I'm never good enough for my family. I haven't ""sacrificed"" anything in their lives. They constantly remind me of my shortcomings and pick on me and he just begs me to ride it out until we can move our new trailer off their land so I don't have to deal with it anymore. Some days I feel like I can do it. But today.... fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This was a bad day.

I got randomly grabbed out of nowhere on the neck, picked on a little in a fun joking manner but my anxiety took it and ran, and I realized nobody needs me anymore. Nobody. At my home I had 12 pets. 4 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos. I lost 2 of the dogs and 3 of the cats. My leopard geckos are being housed with a friend but they can't take care of them much longer. My remaining dogs and cats, including my service dog, are with a foster mom. Since Coronavirus I lost my job and their trip (that I'm paying for) to me is postponed indefinitely. They've all accepted her as their mom.

My pitbull hated her new collar that I sent her at first because that was the collar she knew with me. But she also had it during 2 trips to the pound (when I adopted her she had it and when my mom dropped her at the pound she kept it before I had a friend readopt her for me as I was already across the country. I paid for it.) Today foster mom tells me she loves the new collar now. The old collar got brought out and she ran from it. She ran. She doesn't need me anymore. None of them do. My service dog accepted foster mom as new home within a week. Pitbull took 2 months but she's finally given up on me. My cats never needed me. I was a fool to think they did. I've never been without pets ever. I'm 19, we always had at least 3 in my household. They're my reason for living. I'm becoming a veterinarian to help them. I've wanted to since I was 9. But they don't need me. I'm useless. And worthless. I can't commit suicide because my instinct to survive is too strong. It's like my brain and heart want to die but my body won't give up on me. I can't bring myself to try. I can't even do that right...

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get some stuff out there to people who will understand."
1,I need some help with thoughts. I’m a teen and my life sucks I am homeschooled because I was bullied for being short and have been mistreated for years and even by my friends since pre school. And I’m worried about the corona virus for other reasons and now I heard that my brother got her girlfriend pregnant and they’re 16 and 17 and I don’t know what to do I am freaking out I worry everyday and I am crying and this is stupid but I always say “it I don’t ____ I die” like if I don’t go to the bed in 5 seconds I will die like I’m pretty sure it’s with my ocd or something but it pressures me someone please help
1,"This shit went downhill quick, didn’t it?. I’m 18, class of 2020. Ya perfect time for all of this to hit, really. Truth is, I was doing so well, like a lot of people here. I had finally clawed my way out to a “stable” mindset and really thought for once it was going to be ok for a little while. Coronavirus hysteria has held me hostage for a month now. I can’t see my boyfriend, and quite frankly it’s taken a toll on him, too. With both of us sinking into depressive episodes and being locked away, it’s hard to connect consistently anymore. I had no friends to begin with. I lost my job and now have a solid $26 to survive the next unknown amount of time with. My bed has a dent I’ve been laying in it so long.

My point is, just like everyone, I’m losing my shit in this quarantine. Every anxious, OCD, depressing thought is here to play. No amount of working out, arts and crafts, movies, or taking a walk will stop them anymore.

I’m sick of people saying it gets better. It’s not getting better, and I’m sick of lying to myself that it will be. My youth is being eaten up by some asshole who ate a bat. The perfect time for a depressed graduate to try to start up life is in a economic crisis, right?

Fuck the guy who ate the bat, fuck the people who can’t stay inside because “muh kids need 4 gallons of milk and 80 packs of toilet paper”, and fuck all of this. I’m tired."
1,"There is absolutely no hope for me left. I spend my days playing games and cutting. I can't fucking take this life anymore. The world's fucked this whole thing is so fucked. I hate this life, no one likes me I can't sleep nothing works I'm just completely and utterly fucked. And I'm too scared to end it. Like, how fucking hard is it I can do it rn. Fuck"
1,"I want to go to a mental hospital but. I’m not going without my phone. My brain is on this thing. My books my music, everything. What’s everyone’s experience with this?"
1,"Music is Life. So I just discovered ""Runaway by Lil Peep.""

Can you guys give me your favorite songs to listen to with similar vibes, or just good songs when you depressed in general. I want to make a playlist.

Thank you."
1,"I’m a ghost watching my own life. I’ve talked to therapists. I’m on meds. I’m doing the best I can but I’m stuck. I’m drinking a lot these days (after being sober for months) because it gives me a few hours of disconnection to the numbness. I know that doesn’t help anything but I also want some immediate relief and it’s all I have. I know this pandemic is the reason my depression has escalated to an uncontrollable level but I can’t fill the emptiness. My bf said today “it’s like you’re not fighting”. I am fighting. But it’s like expecting someone who just got their arm cut off to pick up a sword. Someone please, tell me how to keep going. I’m tired all of the time. I’m not suicidal per se, but I’m not alive. I haven’t been for weeks now."
1,"February 23, 2019. Some thoughts I had:

 ""Why do we cut? Is it because we're depressed? It it because we try to show people that their words don't hurt as much as the blade? Or do we just want to feel something? Whatever the reason is; we (not all) feel the need to be asked.
  We don't like it when you found out that from someone else. We want to tell you what goes through our mysterious minds. Is a bit difficult when you're yelling though.. you aren't the ""police"" trying to make us tell you some type of information. If you could just CALMY ask us. Screaming will just make us want to keep all our feelings out of your sight so that you won't yell.
  We understand that you are worried or desperate to know,but we won't tell you willingly if you don't want to listen willingly. Please try understand.. we feel like no one could ever care if we die,disappear,or have problems in our lifes. You probably never went through what we went through. We can feel that you are upset or disappointed at us, but please.. don't give up on us.
  We might keep doing it until we are as empty as an egg shell. Not only do we cut,but we try to get rid of pain in many ways. Some do drugs,vape,drink,or are just darn mean. Some cut,bite,try to suffocate, drown,hang,or cry. We are people; and just like animals:not all of us are bad.
  When I get upset at someone,I do many different things. I get out of there,I break something,bite, or just cry for how much I feel like hurting them. While am typing this.. I cutted my arm.. a little too dip than usual. My arm feels tingly, numb,and I feel an urge to taste my blood. Wierd?
  When people make me feel depressed, I have a sick pain in my stomach that makes me feel like throwing up or punching my stomach. I just read that when you cut yourself; your life spam(or something like that) decreases by 6%. I must be close to dying then :')... I have many friends that do the same,that feel like they can't keep on going. Some friends that I left behind because of moving. 
  She had depression.. I don't know how she's doing now. I hope she made it to the top! After talking to one of my old friends, she said that four people had died during Freshman year. I was so worried that it could have been my friend.. I left her without succeeding to make her change her mind.
  I have more in my mind,but am too tired. I'll go to sleep now. Night. And morning just in case I don't wake up.."""
1,"I’ve never been suicidal, and I’ve always assumed I’d never be put on anti-depressants unless I was suicidal. But I’m starting to think otherwise. Anyone have any POSITIVE experiences with SSRIs?. I think like many people on here, I’ve been plagued by depression most of my life. At least as far back as I can remember, likely the early teenage years (I’m 25 now). With being indoors all day, it only has gotten worse. 

My depression has never made me think about suicide, not even for a fraction of a second. I just never have thought about it.

My depression is simply lack of literally all energy. I wake up, and lay in bed for a solid 3 hours (on a good day). I think nothing happy, and just feel absolutely no happiness or urgency to do anything. 

Over the past year, since being in grad school, my depression has most definitely gotten worse. I don’t want to get up. No amount of caffeine can help me accomplish anything. I truly just do NOT have energy in me.

I have tried everything to bring positive change in my life. After the 3 hours of doing Fuck all, I drag myself to the gym 5-6 days a week. I am able to eat healthy. I’ve managed to get quite muscular, while at the same time being horribly depressed with no desire to pursue friendships or relationships. I go on long walks, I run and other forms of cardio.

There is only so much exercise and self care I can do. It keeps me from falling into a true pit of despair I believe, but it certainly doesn’t cure my depression in the slightest.

I’ve now started to think trying anti depressants may be for me. I had my testosterone tested. Twice. It’s completely normal. So I know it isn’t lack of that hormone, which I had suspected before to due lack of libido.

Does this sound like a case which would see a positive change by trying anti depressants? Can I at least try it, come off if I don’t like it? I honestly don’t know what else to do at this point. I’m not in danger of trying to take my own life. I just simply don’t have energy to DO any life."
1,"Not ready to get off anti-depressants. So I've been on anti-depressants for about 5 years. 2 years ago I found a medication that works really well for me. Last year I was consistently feeling good so my psychiatrist started tapering me down. The past couple months however I started having days where I just get really down. At first I thought it could just be the normal ups and downs a person has, but those days have been becoming more frequent and now most days of the week I'm left feeling that once familiar emptiness of depression. I'm scared to bring it up to my parents, since they were happy about me getting off the meds."
1,"Random worry 2/of many. There was this time I decided to tell everyone in my family that I was bi. Everyone was cool about it, and it made me happy:)... except for the person I live with.. my grandma. She was the last person to know. She's a Christian person that does not approve of this type of thing and says people are just being rebellious and are going to Hell for that. 
  We were outside, sitting around a small table in our front of the house. Just enjoying the day with some coffee and tea(me lol). I already had made up my mind to tell her about it. I was shaking. I wrote down what I felt that day(July 4, 2019). This is what I wrote:
 
"" I told my grandma that I liked girls. And now I can't stop crying for what she told me.. I have a major headache for holding back my screams.. or probably because I started hitting my head on the floor.
I feel like leaving because there is just no way of undoing this. Why did I say that? I was having a lovely morning and I opened my big stupid mouth! I don't feel like getting out of my room for anything.. I haven't had breakfast either.. shit. 
I just have got to calm down.. but I can't! When I think I finally stopped crying, I think of what happened and more tears keep reappearing.. kill me please.""
  
  I told her that she'd be disappointed and would throw me out. She was disappointed and said that she wouldn't throw me out. She was just a bit upset that she wouldn't be able to keep the promise she kept to my mom(Rest in Peace) of making sure I was a good Christian kid to be able to get into Heaven and see her again. I was crying in front of her. She didn't yell, but I could hear the disappointment in her voice. 
 These days we get along. Probably forgot all about it or just thought it was a phase. I won't bring it up around her though. I choose peace while I still live with her. I don't like loudness. Not negative loudness that is."
1,"Heavy coat. There’s a saying I like to say and it means a lot to me .  It says a lot to people that have issues of every day life and how it effects them 
I have depression and anxiety may be not the same as everyone else has .. but this is all the same concept. Please take it as it is and smile because someone out there is thinking of you.

Depression is like a long big heavy coat  someday we will be able to walk over to the wall hang it on a hook and walk away."
1,"Does Instagram make you feel like you’re not good enough?. (30M) While I do believe that Instagram can be a good platform to promote certain things like photography, music, etc., on the flip side, I do feel like it’s just not good for you if you suffer with depression and/or anxiety. People constantly show off how nice looking their bodies are, brag about how successful they are, etc., and it just fuels my depression like crazy. I try the best I can not to spend a lot of time on there for the sake of my mental health."
1,"Isolation is killing me. This stupid virus has done too much damage already. I want it to be over.

I went from paranoid delusions, fearing the end of the world, to this fucking depression. I feel nothing but isolation. Contact with my friends no longer helps, because we are not face to face. I find that I draw my happiness from contact with others. Being without my friends has sucked the life out of me. My soul hurts. I spend more of my day sleeping and moping around instead of doing things I enjoy. When I try to do things I enjoy, I cannot stay focused. Instead, I keep focusing on how alone I am.

I spent the better part of the evening staring at my razor blade and thinking about what my death would feel like. What would it feel like to watch my life bleed out of me? Would it hurt? Would it be fast? Would my friends miss me? Would they even get to have a funeral? How would my wife feel? How would my family be impacted?

Why do I feel like this? Why can't I just be normal? I want to stop hurting."
1,I deserve this. I deserve to feel the pain and the tears because I’ve caused people just as much pain and tears.
1,"I am the worst. Everyone I know is either getting married or has a deep family connection or fucking something. I’ve never been able to get close to my family, and in all honestly I truly believe their lives would be exactly the same if not better if I wasn’t here. All I can do every day of every week of every goddamn month is just lay in my bed and do nothing. I don’t have the energy to get out, to better myself, to do fucking ANYTHING. Sure I have some friends, but they don’t see me more than once every two weeks, but anyone that I’ve spent longer periods of time with couldn’t fucking stand me for longer than a week. And don’t even get me started on relationships, where the idea of being with me is so horrible that every girl has left within a week, and that’s not even an exaggeration, I’ve had more relationships last 2 days than last a full month. If my family doesn’t care that I’m here, if my friends rarely ever see me and therefore rarely ever think of me, and love is something that I can never have, then why in the fuck am I even fucking here in the first place. I just want this all to end, I’m so fucking tired. I just wish someone would come kill me so I wouldn’t have to do it myself, I can’t fucking do this anymore"
1,"religion, and why i get offended by a lot of christians.. well this hurts me a lot. i've recently been told

""if you aren't christian, you deserve all hatred in the world.""

wow. just wow. please don't come attacking me because I don't believe in your religion. if you actually appreciated your religion, you wouldn't be mean to people you don't even know. :') 

i know we say stuff like this all the time, but this just really hurts man. when people just say ""if you don't believe in this you're stupid and deserve this and that"" 

just shut up. 

thanks for reading this

no hate please xx"
1,I will never fall in love again so what’s the point. I can’t get over my ex and I don’t think I’ll ever love again so really what’s the point of living. I don’t know what to do anymore.
1,"How to ask for help?. My boss is very kind and personal. She’s always notices when I’m not as lifted as usual and checks in with me. It makes me think she somehow knows what I deal with.

She’s the only person I feel comfortable reaching out to right now but I don’t know if it’s appropriate or if there’s a point. I can’t imagine there’s anything she can actually do for me. I don’t even know what I’m hoping for. I really want help but I don’t want it to just be a venting session where I’m putting my pain onto her. 

Would appreciate any feedback on experiences with confiding in your boss and how I should go about it (if I should). Thanks. 

Also, I am trying to seek medical support (therapist, medication, etc), but not many doctors are taking patients due to the pandemic."
1,"Random Worry 1/of many. I get worried and paranoid sometimes, since I'm easily trusting of certain things or just easily scared. Last year(September 15,2019) there were so many memes I saw in the internet (yes, I know is dumb. I get informed of everything through there-_-) about this one asteroid that was said to hit the Earth and destroy humanity. I was so paranoid and was never calm because of that. I would cry all the time, thinking how I wasted my years being introverted and never doing anything that would leave my mark in the world. It was said to kill us all in October 3rd. Everytime a day passed, I would cry and just regret my life choices, thinking I didn't have time for anything. I was worried of dying from something else that wasn't myself. I didn't like the idea of something or someone else hurting me, since I already did that. When the said day came, nothing happend. So I took that chance to actually get moving in making my mark. I became more confident because I didn't want to waste any time mopping around."
1,"I am not sure if I am suicidal or attention-hungry. A couple of months ago, I (F19) tried to kill myself. I took around 20 aspirin and sort of kept to myself the whole day. I didn't tell anyone and was hoping maybe I could drift away in my sleep. Although I had painful chest pains for the next couple of days, I did not die obviously. But I kind of knew it wouldn't work. These aspirins were low strength and only 20 would not do it. I knew that I think. I don't understand why I did it. I didn't tell anyone because I feel that it would disingenuous and make them feel bad for no reason.

I don't know if something is wrong with me. From all of this, it sounds like there definitely is. But I am relatively normal aside from my depressive episodes. I like getting dressed up, have hobbies, care about things and people. I do find myself drifting away from life a bit, but at the end of the day, I still do normal things and behave normally. I've thought about killing myself numerous times and this time was the closest I ever got.

I wrote a suicide note if that's important. I did not say bye to any of my friends over text or on the phone. In fact, I refrained from talking to them.

I don't want to treat this as therapy lol. I just don't know if I'm rational and sane right now honestly. I feel that my actions might've come from a desire to manipulate my friends and family."
1,"Just wanted to share my story.. I live in a small apartment near my campus since the first time I enrolled in. I usually went home by train every 2 weeks to meet with my parents and asking me about my college progress. But it was then, when I seems to be enjoy my college life at the first semesters. At that time, my grades were relatively good, in my 6 courses each semester I got 2 A's, 3 B's and a D in calculus (I'm sucks at math, and my math lecturer sucks too.

The second semester my grades were still good, with one D again in math. The third semester again was still good with no D's.

Then the fourth semester is the beginning of my end. My depression starts here and I slowly lose interest in going to college, there's one lecturer that is hated by all students in my major, he gives us quizzes and homeworks every single week and I got an E in that particular subject. I mostly got many C's from now on and rarely B. 

Then came the 7th semester when things get worse than ever. My friends slowly moving away from me, they left me behind when doing group projects, they no longer responding me in group chats. I feel like I'm a horrible and shameful mess.

Now I'm in the 8th semester, and the next May will be my 9th. But with all my shitty grades with many C's and D's, and some E's I doubt that I will get thru it. I can't even think clearly, my mind is full of dark clouds with heavy thunderstorms raining shit. Then the corona came, and now I live in my parent's apartment with my sister. I even forgot to pay my tuition fee and will likely to be extra charged. I don't even join my online classes.

My parents ask me the same things, the college, plus the internship program and thesis that will happen in 9th and 10th semester respectively. I don't know how to answer them questions like at what place you'll take internship at? or how's the thesis? My grades are shit, and I will likely to retake my bad grades till next year. But how do I tell them? They keep pushing me and tell me about it. Now I got the email from my parents that my internship and thesis are swapped so my thesis should be in 9th semester. And I don't know what things to write that shit because I skipped classes.

I began suicidal at the end of my 4th semester. Until now, I don't tell to my parents yet because I know it will hurt them feelings. I'm starting to overdose my sleeping pills with hope that I'll sleep forever before I'm turning 21 at the end of this month. I can't jump off my room in 25th floor."
1,"My father is going to die.. He's only 45. But been a heavy drinker since he was younger than me. I'm a 19 male in university. Few years ago his doctor said he had to quit drinking completely, his liver had a lot of scar tissue. Since then he's had phases where he lightened to beer, quit for maybe a month, but overall he hasn't really quit. Recently he's been drinking a lot because, he's a small business owner in Canada. Small businesses here have some infamy with tax evasion and the current government has decided to finally cut down on it. He was caught and has had troubles/problems since he got a big bill in the mail from the Canadian revenue agency. Which has had him drinking a lot more heavily the last 5 months.

Well, his feet are extremely swollen. Google says a common cause of this is liver Cirrhosis and the fluid just reaches the feet from gravity (he stands pretty much all day). Many people in my family has died of this. Everyone in his family has alcohol problems.

Liver cirrhosis is the 3rd most common cause of death for ages 45-65. He did it to himself.

I don't really have anyone to talk to. I've been an asshole and a bully all my life. It's my fault I know. I just yeah i don't know so I guess posting on a subreddit is something to do."
1,"Is it just me?. Do any of you guys sleep and wake up in the middle of the night once or twice panicking or just randomly?Or even wakes themselves up stressed, it’s like the you kind of can’t breathe so your taking multiple deep breathes.."
1,I need to talk to people.. I'm just looking to talk about life. Reflect ideas with other people who have the same depression issues. Do you ever feel like your life stopped and now you're just watching the world go by in a fading gray blur with no idea how to get better? I think about this constantly and it really makes me want to just go to sleep forever.
1,"The Biggest Thing Stopping me from Getting Help. I'm not sure the best way to word this, but the biggest thing that is stopping me from trying to fix my mental health is the fear of what it would be like to not have a mental disorder. Someone put it this way once and it really resonates with me, 

""You know what the sick thing is, I don't even want to get better, because I'm scared of that too. This is  all I know. I don't remember being happy, I don't remember peace with myself"".

&#x200B;

How do I try to fix this mindset because it is honestly tearing me apart and has been for a while and I really need to fix my mind if I'm going to do anything with my life"
1,"Parents. My parents were in and out of my life and for the most part I was raised by my grandparents. My grandparents would pick me up from school during my very early elementary school years up to high school. I was always at their house early in life and when I got to high school they would come over everyday. In high school was when I never saw or spoke to my parents. When I was in high school and when my dad was able to drop me off at school, we never spoke to each other. Nothing was said from the time that I woke up to getting into his car to leaving. The most that he would say was “I’ll be in the car!” He was always on and off unemployment which sucked because my mom was in school and working a full time job. My dad would just complain that they were spending too much money on my education and kept asking me if I wanted to go to the local public school, not understanding the value of a private school education.  Though they all took turns parenting me, I was always distant with all of these family members. I remember coming home everyday, depressed just lying on the couch putting on the news everyday, just in my own little world. My grandma would come over to just do the dishes and leave. My mom wasn’t going to do the dishes after working day and night everyday and my dad didn’t want to do them. Whenever I tried talking to my mom she would ignore me, always stressed from having the workload and responsibility that she had. When she is stressed she shuts down. After awhile I gave up on my relationship with my mom. If she doesn’t want to talk to me she dosent have to to. But that’s the last person in people’s lives that they would expect to not regularly engage with them. I felt so alone, abandoned. I was late to school everyday, ate the same food and sat at a lunch table that I knew wouldn’t judge me. I wouldn’t always talk. 

I just don’t understand why my parents weren’t always there for me. They have since apologized but it’s too late. They want me off of my meds but I just want to scream at them and tell them that you did this! I don’t want to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It was your genes that I inherited and there were certain events that happened where you could have been there for me but since I had no one, I blamed myself for everything.  I had no one to combat those suicidal thoughts.  Where were my parents when I needed them? This could have been addressed so long ago but it’s now that you are concerned about my mental health? I’m depressed now and they have no idea. They were the most controlling parents growing up and I feel like my freedom would be threatened if I talked to them. Saying that it’s in the past dosent change anything. I feel too proud to ask them for any help. I hired my psychiatrist and therapist for that. I wouldn’t want them to help me. I would never see my room again. They would be trying to talk to me the entire day but I’m a very reserved person. Just seeing my dad triggers me."
1,"fuck.  I’m terrified about the thought that I might wake up someday and realize that I haven’t done a single fulfilling thing in my entire life. I just graduated so when the confinement is over I’ll be able to join the workforce but I’m not at all passionate about my line of work, I chose it because it was the one I thought I’d hate the least. I’m not really good at anything, I’ve never really achieved anything noteworthy, if you asked me to tell you about the proudest moment of my life I’d probably scratch my head for 5 minutes only to realize I really haven’t done anything ever. For some reason I recognize that but I don’t do anything to change it, it’s like I’m waiting to magically feel happy and fulfilled for no apparent reason. I’ve ironically had a “I’M GONNA CHANGE” sign taped on my wall for the past 3 years but nothing has realistically really changed at all. I’m a useless human being and I’ll keep being one until the day I die, this is just the kind of person I am. Unable to do anything at all. All I know how to do is write late night rants that I’m too afraid to share to anyone because I don’t want people to realize how much of a fucking waste of space I am."
1,"Getting Help. (16m) I don't know how to go about asking for help. My parents have mental health issues that they take medication for, so I know they will understand. I really can't explain what's keeping me from talking to them about it. I think it mostly has to do with me hating pity. It makes me feel extremely guilty and like I'm making someone waste their time worrying about me. I've been dealing with this for about 2 years and there's times where it gets so bad that I can't get out of bed and I obsessively think about suicide. I know I need help and I want help but I don't know how to get past the fact that I will hate myself for making them worry, because when I get pitied my mind decides I no longer want help and only want to die so I won't be able to bother anyone anymore. Thanks for reading this."
1,"It doesn't matter what i do, people will always be disappoited.. My mental health is deteriorating more and more every day, and all i want to do isdrown myself in alcahol and sleep. My life is not going to improve soon, in fact, i think that it will never improve. I'm a disappoitment to my parents, i'm a disappoitment to my friends and even to myself. Every good thing that happened in my life i've found a way to destroy it. I'm only 17 but i'll probably be dead before i hit 25. I Just can't live with myself, i have a relatively good life and that's only makes me hate myself even more because i have no real reason to be like this. I don't wanna think anymore, and the only way to stop my head is to pass out or kill myself. Sorry if i misspelled something, english is not my native language and i'm not sober"
1,"I'm losing motivation. I dont want to do anything productive anymore. I used to beleive that i have a bright future but I've fucked it.

Its my fault as well none of this is normal every day life stuff that you cant do anything about its all my fault. I want to work harder but I just feel like I can't. I hate it. I want to be successful but because of my stupidity I'll never be that.

I'm the very definition of a low life. Average grades stays at home all the time (I'm online schooled) not healthy. I tell myself 'oh i can just wait and fix it later!' The truth is I never will. 

The only thing I need is motivation to work harder. Motivation other than getting done just so i can do fuck all."
1,"Don’t wanna wake up. I just go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up in the morning every night. I have no friends, no one cares about me or what I want, I’m one if the unluckiest people in the world, my family DOES NOT care about me even though some people may say differently well they don’t they never have and never will. Fuck it if no one cares about me then why should I."
1,"i feel so pathetic. never good with words, but depressions just completely killed me. My friend killed herself way back in August and even now, it still hurts thinking about it, even reading old messages just makes me feel awful, people around me tell me to get better and forget but it just feels like it never happens. It just never feels like it gets any better, even today I still miss them so much even when it feels like I shouldn't."
1,"How much crying is normal?. Recently I've just cried for no reason multiple times throughout the day and some days I just slump on my bed, staring at the ceiling and cry. Like no one has died or anything I don't feel any pain or emotion at all but I just cry and wonder why I'm crying in the first place. There's only that weight on my chest and tears cause puddles around me. Is this what normal people do? Do people cry for no reason or is crying reserved for sadness?"
1,"What's the point...?. What's the point of trying to ""get better"" if your past has already robbed you of your future? Everything you could/should have been, now a fleeting dream as you wasted your years wallowing in misery. Do you even try to salvage that shit heap? Just for a lame, mediocre outcome that you know you'll never be proud of?

Tried getting a normal person to understand that and you know their response? ""Kill yourself."" (And they were quite adamant about it.) Funny how they think. But I guess if you don't fit in with the crowd or share their worldview, you'll be cut off like a malignant tumor. Nature's way, I suppose. At least I can feel accomplished that I got someone to see things my way for a change, even if they weren't exactly willing to accept it. And it's not that I nor anyone else with depression *wants*  to feel or think the way we do. It's just how it is, as fucked up as it is..."

I try to be as nice and accepting to everyone as much as I can but I’m annoying and people have told me I give off a toxic energy.

1,"How can I help my partner?. I think he is suffering from depression. Below are examples of the messages he’s sent me and he’s completely shutting me out and refuses to talk. It’s been around 10 days of this. 

I don’t really know how to deal with the situation. Should I just let him be? Or should I keep insisting (E.g calling, going to his house, sending him texts)?

“ Sorry I just don't have any energy. I want to be left alone for a while”
“ I love you too. Just need some time to myself. I'm not feeling great and stressed and have no energy.”
“ I'm stressed, I'm tired, I'm foggy. Just leave me be for a while”

Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

Thanks!"
1,"Social distancing is killing me. While I consider myself very fortunate that I have a friend I can be 100% myself with, it's killing me that I can't see him. I also feel like he deserves a better friend than me, so I'm hesitant to reach out when I really him. I've been staying with my family -- whom are very loving -- throughout this COVID-19 bullshit, but I'll never feel comfortable enough with them to be honest about my mental health. I feel like a ticking timebomb with no relief."

I don’t know what to do. I feel like a terrible person for thinking this. How should I go about solving this?"
1,"I wasted the two most important years of my life sitting around doing dumb stuff. I’m a 17 year old athlete with 0 marketable skills. For the last 2 years I’ve sat on my ass being lazy and smoking weed. I don’t care about sports anymore. I realized that they are absolutely meaningless and I want to have a very successful career in business. I switched up my goals at 16 but it was already too late to get ahead. Because the leading people in their respective industries were not being lazy at 15, they were working hard and planning out their careers. At 14 I was wasting my time trying to become a pro athlete instead of thinking about my actual career. At 13 I had absolutely 0 vision and perspective about life. I haven’t done any of that realistic planning and I don’t even know where to start and I fear it’s too late for me because I only have 1 year left. I’m so stressed I feel it all on my shoulders, my entire future riding on my self worth."
1,"TRIGGER WARNING (sexual assault, drugs, Suic*de, S*lf h*rm, Eating disorders) it's really long sorry lol. recently I've been having a lot of issues with some less than fun memories.

**Sexual assault below** 

I was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade I was 11, maybe 12 at the time, it was in public by a peer and I knew other people who watched it happen but no one did or said anything so I did the same and at the time I never felt like it hadn't hurt me or anything, I didn't see my body any differently I didn't blame myself, nothing, I just passed it off and moved on with my life and that was fine...

**Drugs below**

But eventually I kinda thought about it and it all came crashing down, the realization of how much it actually did hurt me but I pushed it all deep down as a reflex and had no clue I was even doing it, as first I tried to get my mind off it with drugs, mainly weed, and at the lowest point when I was going to give up on myself, LSD, now for the average, healthy, responsible adult both drugs wont cause any physical damage as long as it was done in a safe place but both drugs were done when I was between 12 and 13 and only 2 or 3 I did drugs was I in a safe place and luckily the time I did LSD I was at least unable to hurt myself and didn't want to hurt others but I was at school.

**suic\*de below**

The day I did LSD I planed to go home that night and commit suic\*de but when I arrived at school a friend asked if I wanted to do LSD I said yes because I figured ""what do I have to lose?"" I was coming down from my high as I went home and by the time I arrived I was exhausted and ended up sleeping all day and into the next morning and had missed my only chance for months to come.

 **s\*lf h\*arm below**

So I moved onto the next coping mechanism I could think of which was self harm but after almost being caught time and time again, constantly needing to clean blood covered things, and my familys growing suspicion I had to give that up too which I wish I could say was for the best.

**eating disorder below**

The last thing I tried before I shoved the memory into the deepest part of my mind was to get a grip, have control over the one thing I could, what I ate, I knew right away that I wanted to starve myself unlike most stories of anorexia it didn't start as a diet, it started as eating as little as I could physically get away with, I managed to get down to 89 pounds before I passed out after not eating or 4 days whilst still burning over 2,000 calories a day with my active life style, sadly no one noticed do to the fact that I had told the only person that was home I was going to take a shower moments before passing out on my bed room floor luckily I wasn't out for very long and I was so scared by it that I ate right away and have been trying to get better for years but I keep relapsing.

I bring this up because the memory has resurfaced and I don't know what to do with it"
1,"Depression in the time of Corona. What are some healthy but not hokey ways folks are coping with Corona related depression? When you're forced to be isolated and distanced from others? I  cant get out of bed most days. I find myself tearing up and crying frequently. I feel hopeless and unmotivated - I can't concentrate on anything. 

I'm lucky - I have a job and I can work from home, better than so many people. But I need to KEEP my job.

I usually cope with depression by staying busy and active in my hobbies, visiting friends. Distracting!  Hard to so that now being stuck inside all day, everyday. 

Help."
1,"Self Care. How many others struggle with self care? 
Due to this quarantine and school being out, I can’t work so my self care is even worse lately. 
I’ve been in the same clothes for 4 days. I feel so disgusting yet I have absolutely no motivation to even get up and change and take a shower. 
I hate this."
1,"Do you think shoulders pain is the result of depression?. Many times I feel pain or pressure on my shoulders, like 6 days a week. Some days it got worse like I carried the whole damn world on my shoulders and nothing can help it goes away. 

I wonder if this is because of depression or not. What do you think?"
1,"Conflicted. Yo, currently conflicted between what feels like two worlds.

I'm trying to figure a way to give my life a meaning, because I'm currently stuck with ""if I did that, then it means that I'd lie to myself. I'd be living a lie that I, myself created. For the purpose of not feeling depressed anymore, wouldn't I fall back to the hole I dug myself in when the time comes?""
So for the time being, life doesn't have meaning.

I've always hated feeling emotions, some 20 odd years later and I'm still ""discovering"" new ones that I've seemed to ignore and suppress.
Still wondering if there is a way to shut them down, see if that's better. Managed a few times, but it's not consistent and not long enough for me to wonder if I could be like that for the rest of my life. 
To be frank I sometimes scare myself, I sometimes need to calm myself down.

Still trying to figure if I should tap in on my emotions and actually try to connect with a friend or a family member. I've always thought that to have a connection, you'd relate to one another, two distinguished lives having the same thoughts and feelings about the topics one would talk about, not completely identical, but enough to make you feel related as if you felt a connection right then and there.

And bunch of other things.. I feel that this is long enough.

And for the grand finale, life and death.
I've always perceived living as weird.
I still think about us being a side effect of whatever the hell this reality is supposed to be. And worse, if it had purpose. Why would that be? How would it work out? Who or what would be our purpose to fulfill?
And also, why was it me that got in the egg in the first place? Why wasn't it, and please excuse me, a single sperm, not me, that could've gotten there first?
It just doesn't make sense to me. What are the chances of us being conscious and shit wtf.
Getting a weird frame of mind, hope today was better than last night everyone."
1,"I'm apparently a big piece of trash.. Hello reddit, I've been in a relationship with my gf for almost 6 years now. We've been on and off, for the last 2 years I struggled with addiction (It wasnt that bad, just got hooked to coke and spent most of my money and time partying hard). I've been clean for almost 5 months now. Today we got in an argument and she completly destroyed me, she said I've always harrased her for sex cause I was to insistent when she said no. She said all my friends were terrible, she said I was lazy, I had no future, etc. To be honest, this kinda made me realize all of this is true. I've been lying to myself for years now thinking I was a good person, a good boyfriend, a good friend, a good son. It all feels like a lie now. I've struggled with depression before but today it's getting harder. I cant stop thinking about taking my life. Feeling like there's no point anymore, i'm trash and the world would be probably better without me."

1,"How does one believe in oneself again?. I recently graduated college, and all I got for the last five months of my life is ""we have decided to pursue other candidates."" emails. I have felt nothing but defeat since I graduated, and with the recent plague it is even harder to find hiring organizations.  How do I believe in myself again?"
1,"I got an email from HR today that was sent to me and many other coworkers simply saying “Your supervisor and I will be reaching out to you tomorrow or the next day to discuss the upcoming weeks”. They asked for times we’d be available and I assume we’ll just get a call individually.

I have been furloughed and am on an on call basis. I’ve worked one day in the past several weeks. We have customers who need our products for medical things so certain products are essential. I am responsible for preparing materials for the assemblers. That being said I was told last week they have enough material and that I might have to come in for just one product which is what I took care of the one day I’ve worked. I have no idea what this email is about and am worried they’ll be asking me to come back sooner than planned. (We’ve been furloughed till May.) I’m trying to just hope for the best. I have no clue what they want to talk about 

I gotta say I have absolutely no desire to go back. I worked yesterday and I don’t know how I put myself through that on a daily basis. 

I hate my job but am grateful for it, and am aware of how this whole thing affects others negatively. I don’t wish harm on anyone. I’ve made other posts about this so I wont explain my disclaimer anymore lol.

The point is I didn’t get anything done today and am worried that tomorrow I’ll be too anxious to get anything done and that I’ll have to go back to work sooner than expected and then I really won’t be able to get anything done. I’m gonna try to sleep but that’s been difficult for me lately. This anxiety won’t help. 

I feel pathetic for how much I don’t want to work and honestly mentally can’t handle a full time 9-5. I feel there are things so deeply engrained in me that keep me from being a functioning, valuable member of society."
1,"Quarantine made me happier to help me deal with everything until my parents decided to control my life down to the minute. I was starting to feel happy, like I was able to do what I needed to be done to figure things out and get over some people. I was able to call friends and have a happy conversation instead of depressing ones. I was playing Xbox with my friends and genuinely enjoyed myself. Then my parents decided that staying up till 4am enjoying myself wasn’t normal. After I was doing that for 3 weeks and they knew I was doing it the entire time. Now since they decided that i was no longer normal they decided to do a strict “school schedule” while at home so they will plan when I wake up, when I eat, when I do online work, what I do in my “personal granted free time”. MY BODY STILL ISNT USED TO NOT GOING TO BED AT 4AM SO I DONT GET TIRED TILL THEN SO I GET 3 HOURS OF SLEEP SND THEY WONT LET ME NAP. It’s been happening for a week now. They act like it’s bringing our family together but me and my sister just hide in our rooms and that makes them unsettled. They also have scheduled times to go for a walk and to do a hand picked chore when there practically aren’t any left. I don’t see why they are doing this and I haven’t done anything wrong. I just want to go to work and watch my shows in piece. This is all so frustrating"
1,"I'm 15 years old and I feel like such a failure.. Ever since last year I've felt myself going down a deep decline in my mental health. I did acid about 7 months ago with someone I'm no longer friends with because everyone around me was telling me that she was toxic for me. I eventually see a therapist because my friends recommended I do as I tended to lash out at them. The therapist tells me that I have PTSD. I've lost all of my friends because I think that they're all less mature than me and that I've outgrown all of them. The only reason I stick around is because I'll be alone and I'll blame myself. I see the world so differently, I know acid and my (current) weed usage that my mother is actually okay with. She allows me to smoke weed because she thinks it's helping with my anxiety. I try to convince myself it doesn't but deep down I know it is. I tried hydrocodone after fucking stealing from my grandpa's cabinet. I don't know if I'm a teenager acting out, or if something is seriously wrong with me. I'm failing school, literally. All F's and I have had all F's since 6th grade. Yet for some reason they never decided to hold me back. I wish they did, cause now I'm the really dumb freshman who's always missing school and smokes weed. I don't want to be known as that. My therapist tells me that I'm actually quite intelligent for my age. This quarantine has really been messing me up even more. I came in contact with weed again, I can't talk to my therapist anymore because of it, I'm eating more food, I lost my routine and stay up all hours of the night, and worst of all is that I haven't done a sliver of my home school work. I know I'm fucking up, everyone I ask this to tells me that I'll be okay and that I shouldn't worry. But I know they're lying, I wish I wasn't treated like such a fucking child. My dad has sending me voicemails saying that he's out of jail and talking to me like I'm still 10 years old. I don't know how to respond to him because I don't know him at all, all he used to do with me as a kid was do everything for me. But not actually letting me figure anything out on my own, same with my mom. Speaking of my mom, since I'm the only one living with her in a 2 bedroom apartment I realized that I've been through torture for so long. The name calling she does, I get called dumb, stupid, and a pig for no reason, she makes all of these mean noises when I even try to talk to her. My therapist tells me it's her way of coping with her own insecurities because she used to be overweight and some people do say she is a bit of an airhead. Lastly, I think I've realized that I have so much more stuff to go through. I thought I had the answer to everything, I thought I was psychic. I still sometimes think I am. And after looking at all of this your only question is probably ""how have you not killed yourself yet?"" and I don't know. I don't want to kill myself, I just wouldn't care if I died because I provide nothing either way.

(I might do edits on this because I just need to let everything out. I'm sorry if the grammar is bad or weird)

**TLDR:** My life has gone to shit and I have no idea how I can recover. Venting about various subjects including failing all my classes, my dad & mom, my ~~toxic~~ friends, my addiction to weed, and my therapist.

1,"My head hurts man. I’m just unsure about everything. Who I am, what I want to do, if people who say they love me really mean it. It’s driving me crazy. Like I don’t even know if my gf really means it when she says it. I don’t want to be like this. But I can’t help it and it’s killing me."
1,"Wish I could. Most nights I sit awake in my bed and just wish to be dead, that I just disappear and be gone. Wish I didn’t care about anyone else wish I could just do it, but I can’t/won’t. Why u might ask. Welp I’ll tell you. The pain I deal with on the daily is not enjoyable but it’s mine and ik I can atleast contain it and keep living but if I killed my self then the pain would be passed to everyone close to me and idk how they would cope. In the end me staying alive in this hell is better for everyone else if that makes sense"

1,"Any advice helps. Hi,

My name is Jarred and over the last year in my life I have had an ongoing issue of anxiety and depression. I began therapy for anxiety in October of this year which lead to a big drop in my overall anxiety, but I never really brought up depression, as I thought these feelings had direct correlation to my anxiety. However, as therapy went on I soon realized that my depression was an independent issue. But I decided not to bring it up as my mom, who put me into therapy (I was 17 at the time), and my therapist both believed my life was changing for the better and I was a much happier person. The whole goal of therapy was to get my anxiety ready for me to move out and go to college come August and in the eyes of my therapist and mother, I have reached that point.

Fast forward to today. I recently started dating a girl I met at work and our relationship has surpassed any expectations I had for it. I am very happy to say I love my girlfriend and she makes me very happy. However, my depression really drags me down at times and I have constant feelings that I am worthless and I will often feel insecure about myself. I have very few friends and at times I feel like I have nobody in my life. The only person I have to turn to when I am feeling this way is my girlfriend. While she makes me feel much better about myself and cares a ton about my mental health, I feel like I vent to her too much and if I countinue like this she will end up leaving me. So I resort to crying by myself and feeling like total shit. I do not know where these feelings come from or what to do, and I feel just as lonely as I did before I had my girlfriend sometimes. Please give me any advice you feel could help my situation. Thanks."
1,Will I ever not want to die?. I'm 24 and I cant think of anything that would make me happier than not existing... the only thing I've ever wanted in this world is love and I know im not worth loving. Maybe ill die from a sickness or something soon since I'm too much of a bitch to kill myself now. Hope doesn't exist in my life. Only darkness and waiting.
1,"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
1,"What makes your mood go from perfect to absolute shit in a split second?. Personally for me, my mood completely changes to me being sad and on the verge of tears whenever i see or hear mostly anything related to relationships and dating."
1,"Quarantine is proving that people are better off without me.. Hard times like these weed out the people who don't care from the people who care. It weeds out the people who need you from the people who want you.

And yet here I am, left with nobody. Partially my fault, partially just the way things are. 

Ending my life seems even more inconsequential now."
1,"Is it worth it.. Is life really worth living. Yes we all have dreams. But majority of it will never happen. Whether it’s money we will never have. Or a love we will never experience. I can only imagine a reason to live. We all experience different hardships. Some more toxic and terrifying than others. How we handle it is different, but is the pain and torment worth it. Super depressed and mentally unstable. Just a little suicidal"
1,"I feel guilty asking for help. whenever I vent to people or ask them for help i feel guilty and I feel like I am taking advantage of them or guilt tripping them. I really hate asking people for help or just venting. I have not been able to see my girlfriend recently either so now things are really getting bad but I feel guilty venting to her because again, I feel like I am taking advantage of her and just trying to hear what I want because I am making her feel bad for me. i don't even know half the time if im genuinely asking for help or just trying to make them feel bad for me"
1,"I was happy to hear that I have COVID-19. I have asthma and work in healthcare, and everywhere on the media, it says asthmatics are at a greater risk of complications. I was excited because I thought of this being a legitimate way out. I got the virus at work of course, have been feeling awful since the end of last month, and I'm sad to say that I'm past the point of danger. I'm being treated for pneumonia at home, and I hate to say it, but I'm recovering. I really wished that this would be how my life ends, but I'm not that lucky. I wanted to leave with people thinking I fought hard while I had the chance, not looking at it like I failed, how they probably will after I succumb to depression, whenever that may be. 

I'm really sorry to those of you who have family members gravely ill or have passed, I don't wish this on anybody except myself. I hope this post doesn't seem disrespectful."
1,"Depressed all the time. I never really was depressed i just had really bad anxiety.. i was taking Effexor and it wasn’t helping my anxiety so i got put on Zoloft but now it seems like my anxiety is worse and I’ve been so depressed lately and just down and i don’t even really know why. 
I have a video appointment with my therapist to discuss my meds Tuesday, any suggestions."
1,"I think I'm going insane. I really don't know what else to say other than that. I really can hardly talk to someone without getting pissed or start rambling coherently. It's like, everything in real life, the world, and stress of having to live alone with a family who are pushing me against a wall when it comes to mental health.

To put it mildly, I feel like I'm starting to lose it, mind-wise. Perhaps it is just a side-effect of being Depressed in general, or maybe I am going Clinically Insane. Wow. That's fucking wonderful, isn't it?"
1,"Why do I act out on social media?. I (24M) have felt the urge to comment on things on social media to get a reaction out of someone, in hopes their reaction releases what’s clogged in my head. I’m not commenting anything mean, I just have the urge to comment on a lot of things. Like if someone posts something that may not make sense to me, I feel like I have to comment. A part of me thinks I’m doing it to prevent myself from going back into my depression. Maybe I don’t know how to let things go, maybe I have nothing going on in my life, maybe I’m just looking for someone to care. I really don’t know. And when I do comment I get anxious and get scared to open the app. But the relief after a sharp reaction from someone eases my brain. Like I can physically feel it. Feels like something has been snapped which then releases a flood of fluid. I also think I’m acting out of fear. But fear of what? Lastly I did start therapy this week."
1,"I truly believe I can't be saved. I'm too far gone now. I can't feel anything anymore.  I look inside myself to try to find something, anything, that tells me I'm alive. But all I feel is the need to die, or to just not exist anymore. I have nothing left but the hot coals of rage and the cool icy feeling of numbness. There is nothing else...I am beyond saving."
1,"I don’t feel the boredom everyone is complaining about.. Can anyone relate to this?  I have desires to do things but I can never bring myself to actually do any of them.  Boredom isn’t affecting me like it does all of my peers.  I don’t find myself feeling restless at all.  I don’t feel tired of staying inside or just using my phone, I think it’s because I’m so conditioned to being exhausted and never doing anything else.  
I can’t describe exactly my feelings on this subject but hopefully someone in the comments might relate and understand better."
1,"I just want to stop existing. Get killed. Die honourably (run in front of a train to save a kid or something). M24. In law school. Life sucks. Quality of life is on the decline. Compared to past generationts we are producing more and more wealth for our corporate overlords while quality of life continues to fall. Bad enough. Due to COVID, I am now unemployed this summer and had to move back in with my parents. Hate it. Compeltely feels like everything I ever worked for is pointless. That I am back at square one.

Live in Canada but of South Asian Muslim background. South Asian Muslim culture is f*cked up. Teens and young adults are infantilized. Really not good for one's self-esteem and sense of self worth. I was a devout Muslim in my teens. Left the faith about 4 years ago. I believe in creator and I do believe in certain religious values but I do not believe in Islam or in any particular religion. Honestly, I abhor Islam. The God of Islam is harsh and cruel and has ridiculous demands. Full rigidity. No Flexibility. Like starting in 10 days I have to spend a month starving and dehydrating myself to appease a psychotic God who will severely punish me if I don't. It spikes my depression. And since I am unemployed at stuck at home, I really have to sneak to cheat. And I feel bad doing it when my family is fasting. My dad is really religious and I have a super religious grandma (typical stereotype) so religion is a dominant topic in the house. I also have objections to its truth claims, I just in good conscience cannot accept Muhammed as an infallible final prophet and a source of moral authority

I have never really had it great. Never really had friends growing up outside of a couple family friends. Didn't really make friends till undergrad, and the first group of friends I made turned out to be sociopaths out to get me. I have some friends now. I am also close to my little cousins but they live abroad so I cannot really be in contact with them. Of course, my extended family are all mostly practicing Muslims as well so I cannot really have an honest relationship w/ them and I worry about the future. Either I have to pretend to be a Muslim, end up in a loveless arranged marriage, and keep familial ties. Or I officially leave the faith and destroy my family.

In my 4th year of undergrad (2017-2018) I fell in love with someone who was everything I ever wanted in a partner. Successful, moral, life-partner type, virign, great with kids (all of which I bring to the table). Everything I was looking for. She also was, as a bonus, from a well-of finally and beautiful. She was what it seemed to be a true happily ever after. I had suffered a lot and worked hard in life. My family isn't poor (though we were that when we were younger) but we are not rich. My undergrad college though was full of rich, white private school kids. I put in a lot of effort to get where I am at (my resume is stellar and I had to overcome a lot of barriers to get there). The idea that my effort paid of and I could marry a rich white private school girl was a dream come true. She and I got along very well. She was kind hearted. I really thought I had found my match. But for whatever reason, she rejected me. My entirety of everything I worked so hard toward my whole life for - my happily ever after (and yes I know no marriage is truly like that) taken away from me.
I have not been able to find anyone like her. And even worse, because I am male, I have been attacked instead of given sympathy. The dating system is rigged against men. Men are systematically oppressed by women into making the first move. Into taking the emotional burden. Into being and acting a certain way and catering to women's views. Women claim to believe in equality but sure don't act it, by holding men to traditional gender roles while they themselves have been freed from it. Men are still statistically seen as ATMs and providers. And this has bene shown from what people have told me. People have attacked me for wanting a fair deal. That because I am a man I have to be open to marrying down. That despite all the barriers I overcame, I have to be open to marrying someone who has it easier and didn't accomplish as much, ruining all the effort I made in life. That because of my gender, it is my fault she rejected me because I didn't ""ask her out correctly"" or whatever BS hoops men are expected to jump through. (I don't see how it should make a difference but apparently it does. Must be nice being a privelged woman). As a man, I am told that I must just accept a woman who slept around and then wants to settle later in life. Doesn't matter that I come in with purity and certain values. That I have to accept nonense. She didn't go down 2 steps to be with me, and her things were based on privilege of birth, not effort or morals. But I am expected to go down 20 steps to be with whomever

She also was a Catholic. So when I fell for her I started looking into the faith and I found a different kind of God. A loving God. I was so close to converting. If I actually married her, I would have converted. But I do not think the faith is true either. Sure I like things about it, but if it were true God would have given me way in, I.e. that woman's love. Again I thought I found happiness but it was taken away from me. 

I just want someone who loves me unconditionally for whom I am. My parents don't due to faith. So unlike most of the world, I don't have that. I don't have true love. Which is why I can never be happy. And it seems that men do not get true love. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. That men do get valued beyond being resources for women, but it doesn't seem like that.

I would love to be a rich western culture woman. Get the best of everything. I encountered many of them at undergrad, living the dream life. It would be great to have parents accept you for who you are. It would be great to have financial oppurnity. To have tons of self-esteem boosts from suitors. To have true love and relationship dynamics rigged in your favour. I love kids, if I was a woman I could get either get a one night stand (though that kind of behavior is not my thing) or go to a sperm bank and get a kid. As a man, I must commit to a woman and hope she doesn't divorce and take the kids. More stress, less options

I really hate who I am. I wish I were a rich western woman. Living that happy life. Instead I am cursed. Never fully accepted by my family. Raised in a f*cked up religion / culture. Oppressed via society due to my gender. Never get true love and be loved unconditionally for who I am. Quite likely never get kids. Never get happiness. And will just suffer, working as a corporate slave till I die.

Sorry for the rambling. Thanks for lsitening"
1,"I’m cold hearted ?. Sometimes I feel like I come across as cold to people. They get used to this fake persona that I present, then when I’m not pushing it people will tell me I seem cold or calm. I don’t know what you want? I’m trying my best? I just feel empty sometimes. Life seems pointless sometimes. Sorry my emptiness is showing. I don’t even know anymore."
1,Covid 19. Theres a part of me that justs whishes id catch the coronavirus just so it will all end i am tired and i am ready to die. I feel as though i havw nothing left and that i have never mattered to anyone untill i had nothing left. For so many years i shruged off the abuse of always being told i am not good enough that i dont mesure up that i am a loser. Well you guys won i believe it now. And now you tell me i matter and all the little things i do are achievements but its to late i welcome death it be a belessing for it to end yet i cant bring myself to commit scuicide for some reason but if the covid could take me out id be okay with that ...

I didn't open my message at all for 2 weeks. Now my siblings are pissed off at me and they even said my friends are looking for me and asked me to open my message. I'm scared to open my message and there's this unknown number that keep on calling me everyday. I want to answer it but I get nervous breakdown when I see the number. Idk why and it's killing me cause I feel like this call is important but I just can't do it. I want to disappear"
1,"need help or i lose my graduation project in which my career life depends on .. i m losing my determination to go on.

1,Has online counseling helped anyone here?. Kind of in a low spot right now and would really like to talk to someone who could help me. I don’t have anyone close to me that I can talk to..

1,"feeling suicidal because of penis. i'm sure you've all seen this post before, and i've read every one like it on this sub out of desperation.. but i really cant do it anymore and i have to say something

my inadequate penis has brought me so much shame and feelings of worthlessness throughout my life and it's only gotten worse. these past few months it has gotten completely unbearable. i avoid urinating and showering because i dont want to see it.. it doesnt leave my mind for a moment and i find myself being thrown into these uncontrollable crying fits at night.. it doesnt help that i'm a 26 almost 27 year old neet never been able to hold down a job for more than a few months due to who the fuck knows what. plagued with horrible depression and anxiety, ADHD.

 have 0 friends, never been in a relationship and i'm finding myself losing it with the realization that i'll never experience being wanted, or desired, or satisfying a woman.. to see the look of excitement in her eyes when she sees your big penis must be so great. 

the only advice people seem to give is to basically distract her from your penis with good oral.. and hopefully try and forget about the 8"" silicone penis underneath her bed that she turns to when she wants to feel good. this life is so fucked and it's only getting worse. if i had any courage at all i would end it."
1,Quarantine is bad. I am a high school senior and I have had depression in my life since I was in the 2nd and the reason today just took a turn for the worse and I got in an argument with them because they are trying the best to force religion on me and because I have a big family who are all super religious I feel like a outcast all the time. Even now I can hear my family outside laughing and having fun while I’m here crying. Because of quarantine i am home all the time and I feel like an outcast in my house and the only people who I feel close to are my friends and even though I try my best to talk with them it’s not going good because of this quarantine. And I’m pretty sure that the closest person in my family now dislikes me. My family try’s to show me as the bad kid to my younger siblings by saying things like don’t end up like me and that I’m a bad influence ( which I can sorta understand because I’ve also went and thought it was a good idea and tell my parents about how I smoke weed to help cope and now I’m the pot head in the family) I’m sorry that this is long but I just wanted someone to hear me out so thank you.
1,".. i even started liking the way all my removed yet posts were ignored. like i know there are so many and the time i post something is... depends on were are you from, for me it's now 4:30 morning; but it only makes me feel more and more sure (like i didn't reach it yet) about my wothlessness.
the way i wanna hide everything deep inside and scream it at someones face at the same time...
why am i still alive? why can't i just go sleep and don't wake up?"
1,"Jaded with medical care and the concept of improvement. I have a long history with the Mental Health industry. Multiple therapists, multiple trips to the stability ward, multiple different medications. I've heard everything, seemingly, that those things can say, because they keep repeating themselves:

>""every experience strengthens you""
>
>""it gets better eventually""
>
>""this medicine will help""
>
>""You're valuable""

To say I've had a ""bad"" experience with the Mental Health industry is disingenuous. All my former counselors are good people. but interacting with them doesn't go anywhere. My past has *not* strengthened me. It has *not* gotten better. The medicine did *not* help. I'm *not* valuable. And please, don't bother disagreeing with that last one in the comments. That'll save us both some energy and time. That's not the point of the post, I've spent far too much energy and time discussing that with the  Mental Health industry. Thanks.

I've long held the position that if I ever end up in the hospital again, I'd never leave. because there's no growth, no plan for my future or any future. no hope for me. This is where I am, and I can't get better or worse, I can only *appear* differently, and only in the short term. Even that I think is lost for me because I can't pretend anymore. I can't pretend that this isn't how things are, and can't pretend that this isn't how things will be.

So why am I here? because in all that I have experienced, no one has agreed with me, ever. no one has actually considered or entertained my position. no one has said *""you're right, 14ierophant: that life sucks, that you're going to die, and that everything would be better if it happened soon. ****In the meantime, here's what you can do****.""*

And that's what I'm looking for. I don't need a cure, I don't need to change who I am, I don't need to be happy. We're so far beyond happy at this point, trust me. I just need a reason to do something, anything, in a world where nothing has value. Where do I turn to find that? What box do I check and on which form? Who do I hire or ask?"
1,"I can’t communicate.. I’m only ever truly calm and at rest when I’m alone. I’ve realised that I’m not fully comfortable with anyone. Not my friends, not my boyfriend, not even my family. I always feel the need to deliver. I have to provide something otherwise they’ll get tired of me. It’s just easier by myself. When there’s no pressure to be interesting or engaging.

I remember growing up, I’d constantly change myself to suit who I was with. I’d change my personality for the sake of getting along with someone. Now, I feel like I don’t really have a personality. I bore myself with things I say and I find myself annoying. I’m not funny at all and I’m not intelligent or knowledgable and I have nothing witty or wise to say.

For these reasons I don’t really talk. I struggle with one-on-one conversations with another person. So, I can forget about group conversations or mealtime chit chat. I just don’t have anything to add. I can’t even bring myself to answer the door or pick up the phone.

Recently I’ve noticed that I’m distancing myself a lot. I don’t reach out to my friends. The conversations I have with my boyfriend these days are very repetitive and I’m worried that he’ll get bored of me and realise that I’m not as interesting as he thought. Because when he sees past his rose coloured glasses and notices that I’m not as exciting as he thought, he’ll leave. He’s the most meaningful person in my life.

I’ve never been super close to my parents. My mum even confronted me recently about how “I don’t even want to be her friend”. I feel terrible and she seemed hurt but honestly, I don’t think I can ever fully open up to someone. Not even my mum. I don’t think she’d wouldn’t like me. We are very different.

Im scared that when I transition to a new school in September, I’ll be too guarded to even try and interact with people. Then I’ll get left behind and have to spend the next two years without anyone.

I don’t know. I reading this and I feel like I’m probably making a mountain of a molehill. Oh well, at least I got it out."
1,"Am I really depressed, or am I just pretending I am? [16M]. Note: Coming back after writing this, I realize I kinda get all over the place for me. I'd appreciate if you stick with me and keep reading through. Thanks.

Hey, I don't really know how to start this, but I feel like I might be depressed, but I don't know if it's just a ""Boo-hoo, I have a small problem in my life and I'm now depressed,"" which I really hate and do not want to be (I remember doing something like this where I was making jokes about depression and saying I had it - this felt this was definitely faked looking back, and I feel like a complete asshole for doing that, especially to a person who actually has depression (it almost felt like I was making fun of depression) - this is something I will hate myself forever for doing and wish I could take back so bad - I really do not want to relapse onto this behavior - I might have been doing this for the attention, but I really was not sure why I did this at the time). Basically, I \*really\* don't want to be a dick, and part of me keeps telling myself I am really just faking all of this.

I've been questioning myself about this often now, I tried denying it to myself, but I don't know.

Recently I feel like I just stopped caring for some things, especially school-work. I know I used to get anxious if I didn't turn stuff in the day it was due, or that I need to study for a particular assessment, but recently, I had that feeling disappear. I keep pushing deadlines, and I have tonnes of stuff to make up, but I haven't felt the same tension to work that I used to (this is something my mom pointed out) - making me feel lazier. I often now go into class without finishing assignments, pushing them back forever. And also, I feel a severe lack of motivation to do this work - I'm always procrastinating by watching YouTube or whatever. This made my grade drop by a lot - I usually get pretty good grades (A-B), but my last semester has been complete shit (A-C - and low C because I have not turned things in). This is making me worry I could lose my honors classes, which I really do not want to lose and is something I am stressed out about. These grades are not me, and my parents are saying I should drop these classes (which I really don't want to). I feel like it's easy and I can do it, but my grade does not paint the same picture. I want to be able to do my work, and get my grade up, but I just can't motivate myself anymore - or something is going on but I'm not sure. Yet, I am also scared as hell about losing my classes. I just don't get it.

This lack of working has given extreme frustration from my parents. It feels like everyday I'm getting yelled at for not doing my work, or at least doing enough. And when I do some of it, I have so much to catch up on, so ultimately it feels like I barely did anything, and I feel like my parents think the same, even though I sometimes spend hours catching up (also counting for when I distract myself on whatever), I get nothing - no break - no time to relax - and have to use means that I am not allowed to do to get something (like procrastinating even more or staying up late). My mom brought up concerns about a possible attention disorder, but I pushed it aside. After all, I don't want to be the kid with an attention disorder, now do I? It feels like an endless cycle I can't break.

My grades and all that jazz has lead me to lose a lot of my electronics as well. The thing is, I always feel like I really want to do something, like maybe play a game, make a video, anything inspiring, and I just can't because I'm fucking grounded. I want to go and play something on my console, because I feel like I can be happy doing that (and is something I really enjoyed), but I can't because I had that taken for saying some nasty stuff (I will touch up on this later). I also had (right now) my phone taken for, literally no reason. I know this sounds really cliche and stupid, but I feel like the things that make me happy or bring me joy are all gone. Maybe I'm being a whiny teenager who just is not thankful enough...

I also found myself getting a lot more aggressive and angry. My dad has always been a bit shouty and aggressive. He can never command me to do something while also being nice - he always rudely tells me to do whatever. I have lately been whispering stuff back (i.e: Fuck you, What an asshole, etc.) I have not always been this aggressive, but I feel myself going there. And going purely based on emotion, I fucking hate him - he can't ever leave me alone and give me privacy, and he is such an asshole by taking shit whenever he feels like it with no justification needed. He is always asking about my homework, and making it seem like I put less effort than what I really did. He keeps bringing up my work, always telling me off about it, and it's not doing me any good, and I am getting to a point where I can't fucking stand it. (Sorry, I needed that rant - I don't know if I really meant any of it - maybe I am just a normal teen going through teen stuff). I also see myself seething at trivial things, for example, right now when people are coming in my room while writing this, or when my room door was forced wide open by my parents to check in my work while writing this (probably because I want to keep this secret from them - I'll dive into this later). I don't know why I'm doing this, and it's all probably going worse with the quarantine.

I've seen myself going to the bathroom to just sit there in silence and sadness and just feeling horrible in general (usually after my dad has decided to yell at me or whatever), and bleary eyed, have to forcibly tell myself over and over again, ""I'm okay."" before I can come back out. This has been happening quite a lot.

Recently, I had an event of me just crying for no explainable reason. I went into my room and started crying. I tried to deny this. When my dad came in and asked what was wrong, he came in angry and shouting about it, and when I couldn't tell him, he got more and more furious (it almost felt like he was forced to come in - not doing this because he genuinely wanted to). My dad left out of anger and frustration, to where my mom came in and, well, just handled it a lot better. This happened once. Later in the day, my mom asked if I was depressed, to where I didn't know what to answer with, so I just said no (while kinda laughing it off).

I also caught myself eating more. Like, going into the kitchen to grab a snack for no reason. I'm not even hungry - and (context - am already a bit chubby) feel really unhealthy and bad about it. I don't know why I do this.

All these issues have all been highlighted and intensified by the quarantine we are having - especially not being able to go out (as it feels like going to school really helped me with this stuff - it was a place to get away from my parents).

\*These next two things are something I am going to find really difficult talking about (I really tried to avoid talking about these things), and frankly, I am not comfortable having online, but screw it, here it goes.\*

I have recently been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have been visualizing myself dead. Of course, I don't really want to die, but I have been thinking about it a lot - probably too much. I've also done self harm before and recently (cutting my leg), but that was either for me lashing out onto myself, or attention, or maybe both. I don't know. When my parents found out, I wanted comfort, but instead I got a yelling. I also had an incident where I was close to suicide (the issue was frankly, really dumb and it was probably more for attention than anything else), but I knew I didn't really want to die.

I also have an avid masturbation/porn addiction. It's really not doing my any well. My parents found out about this, and they (currently) are not that suspicious of it, but truly, I still have been doing it. I really hate this part of me, and want to change, but I keep relapsing. I know it's wrong (that's what religion says (plus that lives will be terrible with people who follow this path - which I am worried now that is applied to me)). I hope this isn't what brings me to hell (which speaking of, I also lately haven't been praying all that much, so that may also be a cause).

This has all taken me forever to write, and now that I just finished pouring my heart out, I should probably say I haven't told anyone all of this. Anyone. I'm scared of having depression (I don't want to have it - it would suck to be known as the one depressed kid), I don't want to go through therapy, and I don't fancy telling very many people this. I want to be normal.

I think I got everything, but I may come back to this if I feel like I missed talking about something. If you actually bothered reading through this mess, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just felt like I needed to let this all out - everything that has been bothering me - and I really appreciate you reading this. <3

Edit: added random crying + mom asking + some extra bits in the section i don't want to talk about"
1,"For the first time in over a year, I swept my kitchen floor. ^((hello again, I was so humbled and appreciative of all the feedback on my first post here last time. I don't talk on Reddit. I have under 2k karma and 5y+ account. I've been lurking my entire life because of anxiety of posting anything or entering a conversation or just too depressed to even think of contributing. for the first time, on my first entry, i felt so happy.))

&#x200B;

I just lived with it. I fully expected be walking barefoot on dog treat crumbs and papers and dust and clutter. 

Over the past year my kitchen has been filling with cardboard and garbage. I estimate I've taken out 10-12 trash bags over the past month or so. I've had a string of good days and feel like I can do normal person things! 

This time last year I was in rehab for alcohol. I lost 4 years of my life drinking to isolate and medicate my depression. Couple that with having a undefined sleep disorder hypersomnia type which makes me able to sleep for ten, twelve, sixteen hours no problem! I can sleep anywhere. On the floor. Concrete. You know how I Found out? I fell into micro-sleep last year driving 55mph at 4:30 am to work (thankfully no one else on the road) and drove off the road smashing a road sign on my side. I woke up and corrected and all that happened was that my mirror got yeeted into the forest. I can't afford a new one. It looks like shit."
1,"I watched wizard f oz today and just bawled at the ending. I’ve seen this movie 1000 times but it’s never hit me like this Scarecrow always had a brain the lion always had courageAnd the tin man always had a heart

I’ve been in a place where I don’t think I have any of those things and hearing someone say oh no you always had it the whole time just ripped me to shreds and made me break down crying"
1,"I feel like taking a shower. Just because. I took one yesterday and now I am debating on taking one tonight. 

I just want to feel and smell good with my favorite stuff. 

Feels good."
1,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm never good enough for anyone. People get bored with fast and leave. My mother tells me I fat and I should stop eating so much. I'm just so tired of work and school. Stress has made me sick and weak. I just need someone to stay, and not just talk to me and then up and leave forever."
1,"I don’t care about anything. I’m starting to feel as if nothing matters anymore. I could go outside and go on walks with my dog or I could stay indoors but either way I am not doing anything worthwhile with my time. There is no purpose of me being around at all. I’m starting to run out of things to stay to others because my own words and ideas feel unimportant that I can not bare to talk. I don’t want to die because I’m in pain, but just because I am so unbearably bored of life."
1,"Not wanting to eat, and my mom is only fueling a relapse into my (self-diagnosed) ED.. Because of quarantine, I haven't eaten as much as usual. Mostly just because I'm not at school with friends anymore so I don't have to worry about someone asking me why I don't eat. I also just don't like the food at home. Im not spoiled, but with depression I ALREADY don't want to eat, but I'm even less likely to eat if the food is something I dislike. Every now and then I have these phases where I just seriously don't want to eat anything. Nothing related to an ED necessarily, but I'm just too depressed to bother to get up and eat. I would rather go through the headaches and stomach pains then just make myself some food.

&#x200B;

However, yesterday I also weighed myself. I was kind of curious as to what my weight was, because honestly I felt like I had gained weight more than anything with all the junk I had been eating the rare times I did eat. I had lost weight, and I weighed myself again today after not eating anything and I weighed 2 pounds less than yesterday (I know it's not actual weight, just not having any water in my body). I only weigh myself when I want to lose weight (which, considering I'm already underweight isn't a very good thing). It starts small, unconsciously weighing myself and then next thing you know I'm googling the quickest way to lose weight or browsing on pro-ana Tumblr pages.

&#x200B;

It is currently 9:30 PM, my mom called me into her room to ask whether I was going to make me something to eat. I have not eaten all day, so you would think she'd be happy with me eating something... A week ago I recall her saying ""Well, at least you're eating"" when I told her about the sliders I made. I was NOT making something to eat, all I did was take some fries (LITERALLY only 5 of them) made earlier today by someone in the house out of the fridge. I didn't even bother to heat up the fries because she'd hear the microwave and get pissed off. Whenever I eat at night (for me, 8-10 is a normal time for me to eat), she tells me I'm going to get ""big and fat"" for eating at night. She thinks anything after 5 is too late to eat. I know I'm not going to, and I know Im not fat, but her words are like a little fucking depression cloud where you know it's not true but for some reason you still feel bad. I had eaten one fry before she had talked to me. After she talked to me, I went back into my room, was about to eat another fry, and then stopped myself and just cried. I don't even know why. I just cried.

&#x200B;

She's been doing this since I was a child and I'm so fucking sick of it. I remember being 7 and waking up to make a PB&J sandwich (I've been underweight and struggling to eat my whole life)... It was maybe 11 PM, and she told me I'd get fat for eating at night. It was a PB&J sandwich and I was 7, who says that to a kid? Do you know how much I weighed when I was 7? Less than 40 pounds. A normal 5 year old weighs 40 pounds and I didn't even hit 40 until I was 10 and well into my first year of puberty. I'm so tired of her projecting her insecurities on me. She's overweight, not me. She'd rather have me go a day without eating than to eat at 9 PM and that's fucking insane.

&#x200B;

I want to get up and go eat, just to spite her. But I feel too bad and insecure to do so. I want to eat the 4 fries still sitting next to me, but I cry any time I even think about it. I had a little impulse to go download Tumblr again and browse the pro-ana shit a few minutes ago. Usually I don't think about what or if I'm going to eat the next day or not, I don't plan it. But I genuinely don't even know if I'm going to want to eat tomorrow either. Part of me wants to start intentionally not eating again. I know it's bad, but I just can't get the thoughts out of my head."
1,Anyone else here cope with drug use?. I don't hear it mentioned much in this sub but chasing a euphoria is the only thing that brings me joy these days. I'm like a junkie trash can. My drug of choice is anything that I can get in my needle. I've tried to get sober lots of times but life is painfully boring.
1,"I don’t want to get better.. I thought this was just me, but I just saw another post with a similar opinion, so I thought I’d share. I don’t want help. I don’t want to cure my depression. I don’t want to get better because I feel like I need my depression. Otherwise, if I enjoy life, I’ll have to live knowing that one day, It’ll end and I’ll have to let go of everything I love. And that is my biggest fear. I sometimes scare myself to the point of breakdowns by just thinking about my own mortality for too long. It scares me more than anything. The fact that one day, I just won’t exist anymore. And I feel that, if I don’t get out of my depression, I won’t have anything worth holding onto at the end and it won’t be as daunting. It’ll be easier to leave and I won’t be so terrified anymore."
1,Life will never get better for me. I try to be a good person but maybe I’m not deep down and that’s why the world is punishing me . I just don’t wanna be here anymore .
1,"I am tired of this. So I am a a PC Gamer and I bought an XFX Radeon  RX 570 4 GB for my PC and it's been having a lot of problems ever since, From fan rattling noise to major performance problems, And worst of all is that I can't get an RMA as it's used...

I have been worrying too much about these problems and I am tired of it, And I am also kinda scared of gaming now as I don't want to find more problems...

I also like doing Judo but since there's home quarantine I can't go anywhere...

So what do you advice me to do? I am tired of this, Any advice would be appreciated."
1,"I don't see an end to this. I cannot remember a time when I wasn't depressed. Not even childhood. When I was a kid, I used to scratch my face until it bled because I thought that my freckles were ugly and the reason I had so few friends, and maybe if I scratched hard enough they would disappear. By first grade, I was in and out of therapist and psychiatrist offices. When they asked me what was wrong, I would usually say something to the effect of ""I'm the worst person ever and I don't deserve happiness"". I was once even suspended from elementary school cuz I got in trouble with the teacher for throwing a pencil at a student during a test (on a side note, the teacher yelled at me cuz I ""could've poked his eye out"", which is real fucking stupid since there were folders up so I literally just hit his folder and not him; I think the teacher just hated me), and on the walk down to the principal's office, I banged my chest until my the teacher constrained my arms because I wanted my heart to stop. The principal would not allow me back in school until I received a psychiatric evaluation. I think back on those childhood memories, and then I look at my life now, and I think that maybe there is just no end to this feeling. 

  
I've been thinking a lot recently about how maybe I'm just like this. Like, I'm just depressed and that's the way it's always going to be. No meds, psychiatrists, hospital visits, or people are going to change that. I don't wanna waste ten, twenty, thirty, or however many years tricking myself into believing that this despair will just end."
1,Help. Right now I have been dealing with the fear of losing my parents and knowing someday they will die.
1,"Today is my birthday but..... Today is my birthday, but i honestly hate my birthday and the holidays because of how my family is. My family can't be in a room together without all of us fighting and by the end of it someone is crying (either me or my mom). I remember 1 year where no one remembered except from my mom, not even my dad remembered but with how he is it didn't surprise me. i Just feel horrible today because i also feel like i've accomplished so little in my life because of my depression. I see people posting all their achievements and how they're transferring to the school of their dreams, but with me it's a struggle to even get out of bed. When i try telling people about this they think i'm just making excuses or some of them even say, ""That's life.""  I work with what i have but it just feels like it's never enough. When my depression takes over i'm in my bed in the dark crying and feeling worthless then when i go online i see everyone doing so many great things, even the people who bullied me in high school are living their best lives which makes me feel even worse. I wish things were different but i just feel so stuck. Right now i'm just waiting for the big family fight that's going to happen once dinner is ready."
1,I dont know why im bothering to post this but here is every thing about how i feel right now. For some background im 16 and off and on my whole life i have felt empty and i feel even worse now because i had an amazing year probably the best id ever had i became more confident i got a into a few relationships and i moved into a new school but managed to make new friends not nearly as many as i had before but i didnt care about that but since about February i just haven't been the same i thought it was over when my family and i went to disney world but after a few weeks i was back to where i am now nothing that i thought was interesting makes me happy anymore no games i play entertain me anymore even though a few months ago it was the only thing i played when but i kinda screwed myself on the social front in the way of getting support because none of my friends know im like this because i always joke around laugh even if i am completely empty i have let a few things through to the girls ive dated but i never have the time to tell them everything i want to cry i honestly do i used to all the time but i literally cant i have tried everything that used to make me cry but i Cant get the emotional release that is supposed to come with it so i just sit here empty and sad like i should be crying unable to socially isolated literally and figuratively and now bored because nothing entertains me
1,"sometimes I just need to scream. (19m) I've been feeling increasingly terrible. more and more each day. I won't lie I feel alone. I rejoined reddit because I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I've been struggling financially for a while. mostly because I'm trying to become a musician. my first friend group in college kicked me out because I was ""mentally unstable"" the people who didn't agree with that decision were forced to stop hanging out with me. I fucking hate my life. I almost didn't get through this year, but I started to play music from my windowsill. that was my only form of expression to feel better, but now, since corona, I don't have that medium. My whole family is pressure to me. they either expect me to succeed or want me to change my life plans. everyone from my old high school hates me or expects me to succeed. that kind of pressure makes me self conscious and then I breakdown. my first friend group in high school had a girl that I really enjoyed talking to. she was a really cool gal. she killed herself my freshman year. I don't know if that still causes me to feel so terrible. It was so long ago. one of the people from the college friend group introduced me to car seat headrest. I've been listening to them a lot recently. I know it's cringe, but sometimes I turn the volume up just so I can cry/scream. I hope I can impact someone like that someday. I will continue to overwork myself and ignore my problems, while college destroys me. I just thought that trying to put words to my feelings was a good idea."
1,"Nothing to see here. Just another problem child materialising their issues into a reddit post.. I‘m a massive fucking waste of life. Everything would have been so much easier if I had never existed. But it’s too late at this point. I’m now trapped in this shitty lifetime because I’m too fucking scared of dying to off myself.
I’ve come to the conclusion that living is a temporary state and I might as well just wait it out. If only to find out what happens at the end, to see if it was worth it after all. It’s so painful but my own mortality freaks me out so much that I can never bring myself to go through with it.
I’ve tried before, with a few different methods, only to spiral, at the last minute, and pussy out all over again. I guess I’m stuck between the same shitty rock and hard place as a lot of people. The ‘hate living, fear dying’ dilemma.
I’ve been told so many times that suicide is the most selfish act. I get that. I don’t want to hurt the few people still close to me. I also feel like I’ve wasted all the time, money, and energy that my parents put into raising me and it was all for nothing. I’m a failed attempt. But I can’t change, as much as I want to and as much as I’ve tried. I just don’t have the will anymore. I’m drained of motivation and reasons to try to improve myself.
I’ve picked up some pretty bad habits in my life; typical smoking, drinking, self-harm stuff. I think I’m challenging myself to see how much hurt and abuse I can inflict before I cave and finally just fucking die. But in the meantime I guess I’ll hang around and watch this shit show for a little while longer."
1,"What am I missing. I just got a reddit today so I could maybe talk to people that relate to me. So I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I’m 26 years old and started smoking weed back in high school. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome triggered by weed. It’s just not worth getting sick over anymore. Not trying to be dramatic but weed sort of filled that void in my life, or at least distracted me long enough but also I think it kind of made me worse in the long run. I don’t drink. Does anyone have any healthy coping mechanisms to suggest for depression and anxiety? This has been an ongoing battle for me."
1,"Might be getting worse. This is gonna be my thrid post on here and honestly it kinda helps just to able to get it out. I don’t feel any emotions all too often and lately is been bleeding into my work and I started getting asked if I was okay, and I lied and said I was fine, for context this is the kind of lady who is very high energy in the work place and when she talks she wants someone to respond, which with how I’ve been I’m starting to zone out with headphones in playing music and I’m now constantly asking people to repeat them selves because I just don’t pay attention to anything. But back to my point is today I found my self at times being really fake to avoid being asked if I was okay again.... yea so that’s it, I’m gonna assume that I’m not getting better but I’m just taking everything day by day"

Sometimes I think if these lyrics from the song ""Drag"" by the band Low.

""I'm sorry but I can't hold on
It works much better if I let it drag me around

I'm sorry if I'm losing ground
It works much better if I let it drag me around""

I think the lyrics mean that life's much easier and comfortable with no discipline of the mind...just letting your negative feelings drag you around."
1,"I just dropped out of my first semester in college..  I've struggled with my mental health for more than a decade. I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I'll feel fine for a good while, and then it'll hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I couldn't even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I'm simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know if I'm ever going to return to college. I'm still in debt for this class too. I'm living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan. I'm grateful to have it. I don't know what kind of life awaits me. I'm 23, and time just seems to zoom by. I don't know if I can handle a job. I'm very socially anxious, very self concious and self hating, and when the depressive episode hits, I'm 100% useless for an extended period of time. I'm good at art... drawing, writing... I'm even working on game design. I wrote a novella late last year and sold it on amazon but didn't make much, I didn't have much for marketing. I guess I'm just going to persue a commission based income with art and other creative things I could possibly come up with... Etsy maybe? I don't know... All I know is that I feel sad, and disappointed. Guilty as well. Always very guilty. But I did learn that the traditional route of college, and standard job just isn't going to work for me. I really don't want to have to be on SSI forever, but a good start may just be honing my craft and selling my services online. If you've read this, thank you. I don't really know anyone I can talk to right now. I just needed to tell somebody."

1,"I'm not at risk but I want to hear your opinion. Trigger warning possible

I have had depression in some amount my whole life. Recently I have had a breakup and some triggers bring up my past. I have had a rough few weeks. Anyways I just tied a noose because I had some extra rope lying around (suspicious I know but I was just messing around) I tightened it around my neck to send to a friend. I was going to make a joke, ""like my new tie?"" 

The strange thing is it felt so good to tighten around my neck. I felt the world slow down and my heart started beating faster. I could feel my vision going fuzzy. I took it off after a few seconds but now I just want to do it more. I realized how easy it would be to kill myself and end all of the complicated BS I deal with. Death is so easy and simple. 

I'm not going to go through with it so dont worry about that. I know I'll get better as I always do but right now I dont know how to explain what I'm feeling. I feel like cutting or choking myself or something. I won't do that because I know it will haunt me for my whole life but it would feel so good. Anyone have ideas on how to cope? I'll probably end up over eating"
1,"I feel i dont know who I am anymore. I have a shitty family situation and I have no time for me literally I have to be an aunt/nanny and a student 100% and when I want time for me oh no it to damn late then when I want to go out they won't let me, I have no friends I mean I have but they don't talk to me often and I know I should talk to them but my depression tells me I'm just a bother and uhh I feel I want to drop out and idk wish I could die but I can't"
1,"Successful treatment of Dysthymia?. I would wager that I suffer from dysthymia from early childhood, but due to the nature of the disorder as it is hard to diagnose I am only being seriously treated for around 5 years. I am 25.  
As I am descending into another episode of double depression, I was wondering if anyone can share an experience of overcoming such disorder. I feel as if i'm locked into a cycle: I am fighting my way out, and for a while it seems like the medication have helped me stabilize, but I just dive down again.

Returning with less and less strength each time, with a lower and lower starting point it seems. I really hope I make it through this one, But honestly I am both exhausted and hopeless. If you are willing to share, I would be glad to hear how you broke the cycle, or how are you still going through it.

To quote one of my favorite songs: "" I am furthest from the sun, closest to roots of the tree.  
You're not the only one under shade suffering. ""

Thank you."
1,I hate myself.. Quarantine is really fucking with my mental health and being in the house all day with no social interaction is killing me. I can’t stand myself anymore.
1,"I made a hole in one of the doors in my home today. I’ve been WFH and forced to live with a parent who believes they’re going to die from this, between my uncontrollable OCD, them yelling at me for struggling to be able to run some errands and my job while they’re around, not going outside, the stress of my job and the hopelessness; I snapped. My parent made the first move. She slammed the door in my face. In anger, I elbowed it back. However, my elbow was too sharp and made a dent. Neither one of us knows what to do anymore and we’re both telling each other that we’re going to kill ourselves. I don’t how much longer I can keep doing this job, I don’t know how much longer before I take a bottle of Advil, lock the door and go to bed."
1,"How to eat. Hi, first post here. 

My ex-boyfriend broke my heart on Friday and I’ve been in a really intense depressive episode since. I just feel incredibly numb or overwhelmingly sad. I haven’t been able to eat since I had a bowl of yogurt Friday morning. I know that it’s unhealthy for me to go this long without eating, but I’ve been feeling nauseous every day all day since he ended it. I can’t even stomach the thought of eating. Plus with the quarantine, no car, and no family or friends around me it’s rather restrictive for what I can and cannot do. 

Any advice or help is appreciated"
1,"Well, got through another day.. So sick of just “getting through” my day’s. I want to feel accomplished, which I don’t even if I manage to keep the house decently clean and keep my daughter happy. I wake up feeling blah and go to bed feeling the same."
1,"Anyone notice the good things in their life happen too late. Like I’ve been trying like hell to finalize this place to live for the last month. I was going to move in with my girlfriend as we were getting back together. Except she left me last week. 

Now I get news today I got the place but who gives a fuck? Where were you last week when the stress of everything took it’s tole and ruined the relationship?"
1,"I was doing so well. I don't know what happened, but this wave of sadness just hit me a few hours ago. I was standing in my kitchen, reheating my dinner and ""I would be better off just killing myself"" ran through my head for the first time I can remember in a long time and it made me so sad. I forgot what this feeling was like and I hate that I'm feeling it.

I've been bad about taking my meds recently, I'm graduating college into a crazy recession, it's taken me 7 years! To get my bachelor's and now I don't even get to walk at commencement. I'm scared i won't get a job once I graduate and then I won't be able to afford therapy and insurance and my medication and the roof over my head and maybe it's all just cumulating because I have a paper due tomorrow that I can't even push myself to write and maybe if I was better, more committed, not such a loser then I could do all these things. I feel like a fraud sometimes.

And I know people are dying and I shouldnt be thinking thoughts like this and people have it way worse than I do rn.

 Any tips to get through the night? I know this feeling will go away but that doesn't help right now."
1,"What are your thoughts on social media and mental health?. I constantly debate whether social media is good or bad for my mental health. 

Part of me thinks that it is toxic and just leads to me feeling worse about myself by comparison, but another part of me feels like if I delete everything then I’m just feeding into the social isolation of depression and isolating myself from my friends.

I’ve tried periods without it, recently a period of 6 months, but I always end up coming back to it and when I do I feel even more out of touch and out of the loop with my friends. 

Does anyone have any insight/experience?"
1,"Why do I self sabotage?. I have struggled with depression on and off since I was in middle school, I'm 31 now.  It seems to come and go in waves and sometimes I'll be super depressed for months, then things will be better out of nowhere.  I got diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a little over a year ago and have been on medications. I'm not very good at taking them though and have gone periods of time not on them. Why do I do this? Also I feel better when I am around people and out of the house, but even before all this crap that's going on now, there would be times where I would avoid everyone and get depressed. I've been in the mental hospital twice and I'm scared I'll end up back in there again if i can't figure this crap out and stop self sabotaging."
1,"Is it normal for depression to come and go?. I have been questioning if I actually have MDD for a very long time because my mood constantly changes (like a bipolar person). I could be suicidal one week and fine the next week. The cycle repeats continuously. I don’t think I actually had a manic episode though. During the times when I am not depressed, I get really anxious. When I’m anxious, it’s very hard for me to sleep and have more energy but I don’t think that’s mania because it’s also a symptom of anxiety. A year ago, I suspected that I had bipolar and my psychiatrist told me that it doesn’t sound like bipolar to her and convinced me that it’s MDD. She has been medicating me on antidepressants for years which aren’t even that affective. So yeah, I am not certain of my diagnosis and thinking of getting a second opinion."
1,"HELP. HELP

I'm turning 13 soon and I'm not ready at all. today I broke my record and had 3 mental breakdowns in one day today and I constantly feel like I could collapse at any moment I'm not ready for this honestly I just feel like a waste of space and I spent the whole day pacing from my open window and considering jumping out to my bed or trying to forget that I'm turning 13. I still accidentally say I'm 9 sometimes when I introduce myself and don't feel ready or mature enough or whatever to be turning 13.I've already been sorta diagnosed with depression (It's complicated and I constantly have doubts that I'm faking it but fakers don't cut and consider suicide so AAA)  without oversharing more that I already have I am completely lost  and somebody please help"
1,"I hope my new antidepressants cause me to actually have the balls to kill myself. I’m tired of this. 12 years of misery. After being skeptical of starting antidepressants again after getting off them a few months ago, im starting a new medication. I’m hoping that it will cause me to actually go through with killing myself, cause I hear that some antidepressants can cause one to be suicidal. Maybe this is the push I need"
1,"People bitching about quarantine are making me more depressed.. I've been disabled for a little over five years. In that time I have hardly left my house because I have no money. When I first stopped working people kept telling me how 'lucky' I was to stay home. But this quarantine is exactly what my life has been like for 5 years. No chance to go out, nobody coming to visit. Just quiet loneliness. Not so 'lucky' now, am I? Real fun being trapped in your house all the time, eh? WHAT A FUCKING VACATION. 

Suck it up people. You only have to last a month or two. This is the rest of my life.

Edit: words."
1,"How do people exist. There’s probably something utterly wrong with me but the thought of living my life sucks. I’m trying to maintain positivity but it’s hard. You have to work to get money, and jobs suck. I personally have no interests in anything and the thought of having to talk to people and have fake conversations just to get by in that career. Idk my life is just so unentertaining and I’m wondering if other people feel this way too or if it’s just me.

I didn’t focus on grammar or anything so don’t judge."
1,Rage bubbles inside of me. I have been holding everything in for so long and I just want to explode and let all of it out. I always had anger issues when I was younger and would lash out immaturely and break things. As I’ve gotten older I’ve tried hard to change into a much more cool headed and calm person. Which I feel like I have done successfully to some degree. However I feel that recently I have been having anger issues again yet it takes everything to keep it all in. I still try to portray myself as a calm person but I am always so irritable and angry. What am I supposed to do? I am enraged most of the day yet it takes all of my energy to keep it all hidden and not let it out. Listening to music helps me but at what point do I get to feel things again besides anger. I can’t cry even if I want to. I genuinely can’t see how death isn’t the answer to all my problems. It checks all of the boxes.
1,"My senior year in high school I just gave up. This is really hard to explain but I’m just posting this because I need to write out my thoughts and feel normal. 

I thought my senior year would be fun first of all but I was pressured through my parents to still take a few difficult classes with a lot of homework. The summer before the year I started smoking weed 2-5 days a week as well. Applying to college was extremely stressful because I honestly thought my grades weren’t good enough to go where I wanted to. I began to constantly daze out and fall behind in class and not do homework, I would just sit there and be quiet. I saw my classmates having a fun year while all I did was smoke weed once my fall sport ended. I honestly feel like I have no personality and no hobbies or interests, I just feel so boring like I’m a side character who doesn’t fit in anywhere. Weed was all I cared about and I became anxious that it’s chronic use had permanently turned me into a zombie. Right before this corona virus shit I started getting romantic with someone but now he has a girlfriend and doesn’t talk to me. I just have so much regret and guilt and if I could go back I would do things so different but now it’s all over. Right when things started getting interesting and different in life they took a turn for the worse and got put on hold."
1,"I'm not doing well. Was going to try and start a family.  
I had hope.  I had the desire to keep going.
Now probably won't have a job.
I'm furloughed.  Who cares; everyone else is.
Fuck the economy.  Fuck my job.  Fuck my life.  Fuck it all. 
Why struggle anymore."
1,My family is having family show night and i dont want to. Basically what the title said but even if i said no they would tell me to and then i would feel pressured to watch with them and i hate it because i can't say anything back. So i am watching a tv show till 11:30 against my will and no way to get out of it because it is 2 v 1.
1,"Met with my psychiatrist again. Turns out she’s starting to think I’m a lost cause. She says it seems like I’m not putting in enough effort to feel better. I lost 3 jobs, crashed my car, tried to off myself, and had my family tell me they don’t want me around them anymore. All of this in under 2 months. Bills are piling up and I’m terrified I’m gonna get evicted and no jobs are getting back to me. Am I crazy for wondering how exactly I’m supposed to feel better amongst all this bullshit? It seems like my life is an endless stream of unending chaos. Now even the people who are literally paid to give a shit about me are saying they don’t want to deal with me anymore. I’m just so tired of it all. I want everything to stop. I just want out of my head for a few minutes. I can’t even buy drugs to try and cope with this shit ( I know it’s a bad way to cope. I don’t care anymore ). I got scammed by a dealer and my reliable dealer moved away. I just want one thing to go my way. I’m starting to think it’s impossible for me to win anything. There’s no small victories anymore. I’m so tired."
1,"Anyone else wish they could catch Covid-19 and die from it?. I've  been thinking about committing suicide for a long time. The one thing  that's always stopped me from taking a kitchen knife and slicing myself  open, and watching the blood spurt out like a *Kill Bill* film, is knowing what people would think of me. My family and friends would know I couldn't hack it and was a disappointment.

But now, Covid-19 has come on the scene.

Dying  from coronavirus is a blameless death. No-one can call you a failure  for catching it, it's a virus that strikes the poor and rich, the Tom  Hanks and the Baldricks of the world alike. And compared to suicide, the  loneliest of deaths, dying from Covid-19 is a merciful, beautiful  death.

Compare with dying because I  deliberately overdosed on my antidepressants: and being found four  weeks later by the custodian crowbarring my door open because the  neighbours complained of a mysterious overpowering stench caused by my  badly decomposing corpse (the place where I lay leaving a dark stain on  the carpet that no amount of scrubbing can remove, and which the tenants  that moved in after me do their best to try to ignore).

Meanwhile,  with Covid-19, I'd be surrounded by doting doctors and nurses fussing  over me, applying balms and soothing salves to my skin. My mother and  father would Zoom in to cry over me and call me a poor thing as I drew  my last breaths on a ventilator, and ascend to heaven under the angelic,  white light of fluorescent hospital filaments.

Where  I live, New Zealand, is one of the few states not majorly affected by  coronavirus (we have 9 deaths so far). With so few deaths, each person  that passes away gets a full spread on the newspapers and wall-to-wall  coverage on the TV for a week about their life story and interviews with  their grieving relatives. My death, if it was by Covid-19, would be  remembered, and my life would have mattered. As a young lad in my 20s,  my death would be used to save lives. I'd be used by the media as a  wake-up call to young people that even they can die from this silly flu,  and that they should stay at home. Then, many years hence, I would be  remembered as one of the honored martyrs that sacrificed their lives to  Covid-19. Every year, in April, there would be a nationwide memorial  service where the names of all those that died of coronavirus would be  read out, and fresh lilies and white doves released by my gravesite.

Covid-19: could anyone wish for a more beautiful death?

Please,  if there is a higher power on this Earth. I entreat you. I pray to you.  Please let me contract Covid-19 and die from it, so I don't need to  commit suicide and die a shameful, sinful, solitary, lonely death."
1,"Therapy is such a racket. Therapy is such bullshit. I have a hard time believing it substantially helps anyone beyond just having a potentially caring person to talk to. I get so frustrated when people tell others to “get help” or “seek therapy” like it’s a panacea that will work wonders if only you try hard enough. Been there, done that. It won’t make me physically healthy again, won’t fix my fucked looks, and won’t make me more popular. A big fuck you to the disingenuous “get help” crowd."
1,"I watched my fiancé die one year ago and I’ve completely emotionally checked out.. I’ve felt the worst pain and shock a human can endure without dying (though I tried). Once you’ve been to that depth, everything else is nothing. 

It’s a blessing in a way. Nothing hurts anymore. But nothing makes me happy either. 

I’m all on my own. My family has given up on me they quit checking up. My friends think I’m fine so they quit checking up. 

It is what it is. 

We were together 5 years. He was riding our motorcycle. I was driving behind him. I went into shock after seeing his fat and bones and muscles exposed. Didn’t say my goodbyes, could barely breathe. Surgeon said he held on for an hour. 

He used to hit me when he was mad. He cheated on me. We’d had a fight right before it happened. I’d been pregnant two weeks prior. 

I literally cannot focus on anything anymore. My family and friends are all anti therapy and anti meds so I’ve been trying not to go. They tell me not to then they leave me alone. I am always in a dense fog on my own here. I cannot remember the feeling of joy. Nor the feeling of sadness. I just exist, pretending to have emotions so people think I’m ok and so I don’t make them uncomfortable. 

It is what it is."
1,"I feel so emotionless that even if something crucially good happens to me.... I just feel worse, because I can't react to it properly. I start analyzing my consciousness, and I freak out, thinking I am crazy - because of my anhedonia and damaged dopamine receptors. I feel so emotionless that I feel delusional, because I am not able to match my thoughts with any emotions. I feel so emotionless that sometimes I feel like I'm going speechless; not like I don't know what to say but like literally speechless, my mind gets out of control and I feel like going completely silent. I feel so emotionless, so unconnected to my body and to my soul. When I look at this empty life I feel like I'm in nightmare, but then I pretend I'm okay so good that I can even fool myself it's okay. Nothings connected. I'm so out of touch with my memories. It's just now and random thoughts I can think of, nothing is sorted in any way. Sometimes I get better days, when I wake up in a brave mood, ready to cop with it. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up, and the cycle starts again. I don't know what to expect. It feels like some part of me gave up on me and I can't continue without it. I don't know what's real. I don't know what's faith. I don't know nothing but fear. I feel like a ghost haunted by ghosts that tease me with all of this experience, not pushing to the point where I am really delusional or hear voices or whatever's the maximum level of fucked up mentality, but they tease me just enough to become more crazy and crazy with each day. I just can't feel anything but a creepy peace. I can't remember emotions. I can't imagine a happy place. Feels like I achieved everything. Or like I've achieved nothing, nothing that truly matters. I don't know if I'm getting better. I don't know if I'm getting worse. Recently it got to that point where I absolutely lost control of my mind and where it wanders. I'm so so empty and no medication can truly help it, I believe; no therapy either - I already told the most important people in my life and it didn't give me a relief. Being honest used to be a safe spot, but I played with lies and being honest my whole life so much that I lost the difference between good and evil. I could manipulate every situation to work in my favor. Now I can't be real. But should I blame myself? My shitty childhood and early teenage life created this coping mechanism, not me. It used to be a defense from the cruel world, now I'm consumed by it. Feels like I can no longer escape. I wish I could sleep happily again..."
1,"alone. i feel so incredibly alone.
as soon as it was announced that we were going to be quarantined my heart broke. i was finally getting better things seemed to be getting better. i hate my life at home and always will. and everything’s getting worse. and to top it, i feel so alone. i feel like i have no one. no one seems to be talking to em so during the day i sit and do nothing. i can feel myself falling back into old habits. and im literally not strong enough for it to happen again. i cant do it."
1,"What is this?. I’m not sure if this falls under the category of depression. But does anyone else feel undeserving of good things? Like when good things start happening I always feel like what did I do to deserve this? Why me and when is it going to go bad to not being this good?  I don’t think I’m a bad person or anything, I have my faults like everyone else but I feel guilty and undeserving of good things happening to me and I don’t know why."
1,"I get flashes and vague visions of the ""ideal setting"" I could be in. Since I can remember feeling depressed, I've struggled with wishing I was somewhere else. Unable to appreciate the now, always assuming there is more to life and never able to accept things the way they are. I think back to the perfectly trimmed memories I have of days before I felt this way and I disregard any notion of nostalgia and assume that in those moments, I felt as happy as those memories seem. I am always chasing that impossible feeling of peace and satisfaction and it often comes in the form of flashbulb visions

I can be thinking about or doing whatever, and a random flash of an unknown setting will commandeer my mind for a second. There are some that reoccur and some that are fresh every time. Sometimes its just a staircase of a home that is incandescently lit, sometimes its a night at home in an apartment I've never seen. Just like a dream, there can be context for the vision. This comes in the form of details about my life at the time. It could be 20 years form now with a family that I love. Whatever it is, it's random and and torturous. Its like a fishing line with bait that is constantly held above my head, taunting me for my inability to attain satisfaction. I don't know what these are trying to tell me but they are a constant reminder that I am not satisfied with what I have. 

I often get lost in the fleeting image that has been left behind after it happens. I struggle with a near obsession with escapism in my lower moods and these visions walk hand in hand with that. I spiral into a jealousy for a dream that is impossible and with every jealous mood I grow farther from accepting reality as it is, allowing me to finally be happy or at peace.

Does anyone else feel similar or experience anything of the sort? I was just writing this to get my thoughts into words but I would appreciate some discussion. I feel very alone in this."
1,"Bestfriend brought me to brink of suicide. When I was finishing high school I had a very strange last semester, I got dumped right before my exams, met the love of my life (were still together) a week later after that person dumped me, anyway while we got together somebody (some random computer dude who also helped ruin my life, was not someone from my school but was someone from Around the world) was very jealous of the fact I wouldn’t date them and proceeded to edit and released fake nudes of me from my accounts because I wouldn’t date said person. (There was one video where it was me topless but that was it that was real) From there everything sort of fell apart and that’s when all the bullying began in my school. Many people told me how disgusting of a person I was how I have no respect etc. I thought I at least had my little group of friends... no these group of people called me the worst names commented on my weight, commented on my annoyance, my breath apparently stank like vagina and Incredibly sexist slurs. When I found out about the comments I confronted them and they told me to leave the group.. from
There I heard that they had a party for my departure and were waiting to kill myself so they can party because of the fact I was dead, after that I no longer talk to anyone and I think that’s why I hate myself as much as I do and my boyfriend I am with now is literally the only reason I’m still alive.. this is just the main part many little things happened that made the situation worse.

I will also add I’ve had issues for years that we’re never clearly diagnosed, I’m on Zoloft for depression and anxiety for about 5 years now. I also can’t do anything without feeling like I’m. Not good enough and I can’t be around people whatsoever without getting incredibly nervous around them.

This happened 2 years ago but I still have insanely massive issues from this massive trust problems, I still feel suicidal and I hate myself profusely I saw the main girl and guy who bullied me on Instagram being happy and I honestly felt so sick I just want them both to die a painful death. I have also considered dumping my amazing boyfriend just because of how suicidal I’ve been and I honestly feel as if I may act upon it.. I don’t want to drag him down with me... Any suggestions?

I posted almost the same thing on another thread, if not allowed please remove"
1,"Will I be able to keep going?. My life is constantly going to shit and I feel lonely, I’ve constantly made jokes about killing my self since 8th grade. At the beginning they were just jokes but soon it started becoming a reality.

I have a very shirt family that does not really support me, but even with all of those problems I still try to put my best effort in things. I have the highest average of all the kids in my grade, I’m the president of my class and I always try to be the best.

The thing is, no person at home really values my effort  and it is really frustrating. I’ll come home with straight A’s but my dad and mom won’t even care. My dad is barely at home and when he is he just scolds me and beats me, calling me useless, idiot and a variety of other insults. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself for the longest time, but teachers, friends and people from other schools tell my I have a bright future ahead of me, that I could be the best engineer, architect, game designer, etc.

These complements are the only things keeping me alive, I just dream of the day I’ll be able to get out of my house and live on my own, possibly with someone that actually cares for me. But until then, every time I come home it’s hell, and now with covid-19 it’s even worse..."
1,"Messing up is the only way I learn.. This world is far less tolerant because people are a much more common resource, making mistakes makes you easily expendable, which makes you vulnerable, which brings on anxiety.

1,"Quarantining with my parents has made me realise just how much my BF does for my mental health. Before the UK 'lockdown', I was living at my BFs with his mum during the week and going home at the weekends, slowly moving to being at his fully. I stayed at my parents over a long weekend so my mum could use my car for work while hers was being repaired when the news came in that we couldn't go anywhere and all that jazz. I decided to stay at my parents so she could continue to use my car if she needed. Cut to today, nearly a month later, and I am a mental mess. I've seen my BF once, when he picked some stuff up for us from the supermarket (my mum started showing minor symptoms) but other than that, I haven't seen him in a month. I miss having him close, talking on the phone isn't enough. I need to be held only the way he does.

Will you help me?"
1,"Just some long ass monologue. Im just tired.  Of every single damn thing.

Of my family, for which Im just a caretaker for my grandma and uncle (her son) for the rest of my fucking life, because nobody else cares about them, and partially I cannot blame them; grandma is not a nicest person to be around most of the time, let's put it this way, and I'm always around since i live with her.

Of my mother, who has been using me for so many years, just so everything will stay HER way. Telling me to cry when dad came home lately and ask him ""why are you not with me and mommy anymore, we're worried"", or to refuse his plushie bear he gave me on the children's day, just 'cause they were separated. Years later, when I run away from dad and went to live with grandma (that was long ago, when she wasn't that way she is now), she often told me how she always missed me and my sister, how she know that dad was manipulating me and ""forgives me"" for things I said when I WAS 7 GODDAMN YEARS OLD. how she went on rehab and was hardly drinking anymore, how she loved me and always would be here for me. And now? Anytime I went to visit her she was always drinking her ass off, making excuses as always. Wanted to intimidate me to cancel my plans to leave my city and move out to the other side of the country, saying that ""If i do it, i won't be having a mother anymore"". And honestly, yeah, she's right. I won't. I don't want a mother who cares so little about her fucking daughter that openly tells that ""she doesn't want to go with me to therapist 'cause she has better things to do and i simulate everything anyway"", and when I tried to open up to her that one goddamn time and told her about my self-harm problems and two suicide attempts, she just shrugged it off and said ""ah, okay, nice"". So, yeah. She's right. I don't have a mother anymore and I honestly don't know if I ever had one.

Of my father, who just... didn't cared then and doesn't care now. Who is able to go arm with arm with me on the street and pretend he don't see me, just to avoid conversation. Who has the balls to text me about ""how he misses us"" and ""how everyone is against him"", and then act like he doesn't know me, my sister, his siblings or his ex wife. But, well, at least he never tried to hide that he don't care.  


Of my sister, who is the only person in my whole family that I'm actually afraid my death would hurt more than a bit. She's just... too pure for her own good. When I couldn't hide that i'm crying she was trying to make a fucking ""memes"" out of random google images, just to make me laugh. And she was actually only one trying to be with me, understand, even tho she's only fucking 10 and i'm, well, a shitty person in general and a lot more shitty older sister. I don't want to push her away, so my death would be less painful for her, but I also don't want her to be hurt in any way, especially not because of me. I don't know what to do.

Of my friends, who just.. I'm too attached to to just leave them like that. I know that they don't care about me that much, that when I die all it will take for them to forget about me is just a couple weeks, but i care about them. If I'm useful to them, if I can help them with their own problems, If i can do anything to make them feel better and have better lives than they have now, I have to fucking do it. Even if that will take years, I want them to be happy. And still... I'm so tired of this perspective and my selfishness. That I can't just end it now, that I HAVE TO keep going for them, to help them overcome their own problems, that I have to keep waiting even for years to finally feel good with myself ending all of this and even though I will always be for them just a third wheel, just this weird girl who they can always talk to when their better friends aren't around.Of me, not being able to handle everything that's going on.

Of my fucking mind not being able to do things properly, care about myself, my future and self-care anymore. Of being too fucked up to even pass my last year of high school. Of not getting over an ended friendship (toxic as fuck, but still) with a girl I can't stop feel something to, even if she had made my mind even bigger mess that it was already, telling me that ""If i want to kill myself that much, then I should do it now, 'cause only thing I deserve is to die alone"", of being unable to hate her, of being too shitty to do anything productive or learn anything useful. Of being always ""not good enough"". Of waiting.

I'm just really tired, that's all."
1,I don’t want to leave my room.. School is shit and it’s cold outside. Why would I want to leave my room?
1,"I am 17, and I am thinking about suicide.. Here is everything wrong with me:

I am the loneliest person ever. I feel like nobody cares about me.

Relationships: i cannot get a any guy to look at me or admire me. Nobody looks me at me and thinks I'm good enough. The love of my life is no longer with me and it hurts so bad I cant take it anymore. I cry everyday after 11 months the heartbreak is tearing me apart. Ever since the breakup I've been fantasizing my own death. Plus the lack of affection and intimacy is driving me insane.

My body: I am skinnier than everyone I meet. It makes me feel abnormal. I do not have curves like other women and it makes me feel embarrassed. 

I'm too socially awkward, I cringe everytime I speak, it is awful I dont know why I cant interact normally and develop close friendships.

I am just a mess. So ugly and embarrassing. And I don't deserve to be alive"
1,"Depression. Ive been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression about 5 months ago and i never really understood what they were or what they feel like snd then the anxiety started coming in and i grew accustomed to it but the depression part was always shady bc ive never really felt happy or unhappy always just neutral but here lately i feel like the depression is really kicking in i have been feeling empty and lack of motivation and really un social and very drowsy alot and i feel like i am breaking apart on the inside. Is this what depression is or is this something else please help me understand what i am going through.
Edit: i am a 17 year old male who has always struggled with displaying emotion if that is any significant information."
1,"How do I get my Mother to understand what I'm going through? Help. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I've talked to many counselors for my school to camp, and once a therapist that came by my school because my school struggles with mental health issues my counselor couldn't keep up with. Regardless they've all suggested that I get help, be it medication or having a real Therapist, but my mother refuses to get me anything for my depression and anxiety (I'm sixteen I cant go over her head). Anytime I bring up that I'm struggling with life she says ""be a man about it"" or ""Real men dont cry"". I dont have a father to help with these problems. I dont know how to to tell her without making a scene of myself. I'm tired of the pain, I want help so bad but I can't reach out because anytime I do I feel like I'm going to get ridiculed for it. What do I do? How do I make her understand?"
1,"Quarantine has sent me spiraling and I don't see an end in sight. I had managed my depression pretty well in recent years. I'm 19, about to be 20, been dealing with it since about 13. Had a really hard first year of university, had somewhat suicidal thoughts on occasion, but had received enough support to know that things would get better with time. I had a great second year, really the first time I was able to fight off my depression for months at a time since I first started struggling with it.

Then when coronavirus started to get serious it was like all of my progress and hope was completely undone. I'm a very social person, my depression comes from having a lot of anxiety and general hopelessness when things look grim, but I've always felt happiest when having support/living life. Now I'm faced every day with staring at my childhood room, reading reports that this is gonna go on for 2 years. I only have a limited time to be young and honestly I can barely bear the thought of another month of this, let alone years or this becoming the new normal. I have never had this consistent thoughts of suicide even if this isn't the most depressed I've ever been. It just has never seemed this hopeless. If it looked like things would be normal even in a month or so, I think I have learned enough coping skills to manage. But this is the first time in my life where the more I see that the end date is not for months or years, the more I question how I'm going to stay sane or alive to see it. I'd rather die of the virus than rot like this. I don't want to seem selfish, obviously I don't want others in society to die just because I can't handle this, but it just seemed I had my life together and now I'm being faced with the worst circumstances for my mental health that I could ever imagine.

Some advice would be appreciated, though I assume many here would be in the same boat."
1,"Why do I still feel like this?. I've been on so many different medications, I've been to therapy. I moved to a different state for a fresh start, I met new friends. All of this should have helped me, but it really never did. No matter what I do, I just feel empty. I dont know if I'm ever going to feel better. What else is there even left to try? I feel like my depression used to be better because there was at least the hope that things could change. But now I know it never will."
1,"What is wrong with me, why no one likes me?. What is wrong with me, why no one likes me?   
Why I'm always the different one?

Even if it's not quarantine I'm spending all my free time on the computer alone.   
I have no idea what to do."
1,"I struggle with the thought that I'll be something to someone, because I never have been (other than my immediate family). All I've ever wanted in my life was to be something to someone other than my mom and dad and sister

I've never had a girl interested in me, and at the age of 28, I feel like a failure to my parents. Every time I walk past them I know they're thinking ""why is he alone?"" ""why doesnt he have a girlfriend?"" ""When is he going to get married?""

And once they're gone, I'll lose the only thing in my life that ever cared about me. I dont know what I'll do then.

How do I tell them I cant do any of those things? How do I tell them I'm going to die alone and a failure, as a man and as a son?"

1,"Does anyone else fantasize about dying constantly?. I've never told *anybody* this. I have anxiety disorder and bipolar and people don't know by looking at me. I'm a pretty blonde with curls and a bubbly personality. But I am *so miserable* inside. I've thought about killing myself multiple times a day since childhood. I grew up in the system and had a pretty shitty childhood but it was no where near as bad as some of the people I grew up with. I had a *few friends* whose parents were brutally murdered in front of them. Or I had friends who were brutally raped as a small child. I mean I had shitty things happen to me but nothing really that bad. So I thought I couldn't really feel sorry for myself. I've always been the person that jokes and tries to be positive to make situations better. But fuck me, I am in a low spot. I helped so many of my foster brothers and sisters out and now that I need someone, I keep reaching out (which I never do) and I keep being left on read. I know everyone is going through some shit right now but damn. Honestly I'm off my meds for financial reasons and really feeling it. Why does the government move so damn slow when they owe you money? 

Sorry for the rant, like I said I'm off my meds :(

Also I'm not going to do anything drastic, I have 3 kids and my 2 brothers depending on me and I'm all they have"
1,"I'm fucked up about myself a little bit more everyday. Hey, at the moment I'm on a crossroad of my life.
My dog died last month, my girlfriend and I broke up a week ago and my studies is going down the drain.

I'm in my examination phase and I can't do anything except for lying in bed, watching YouTube, smoke cigarettes, eat, drink, going to toilet and get fucked up about myself.

I didn't sleep before 2 am in the past 2 weeks (although I tried medicine) and I can not get concentrated when I'm trying to learn for my examinations. If I fail them then the pressure will be even higher. And if I fail the studies then I will be 25 with no vocational training or a job. And I don't even have like a jobidea for me...

I'm fucked up and I hate myself for not being stronger, for being ""lazy"" and that shit.
It's a constant circle of fucking me up more and more.

Maybe you have handled situations like this in the past and have advices for me. This would be lovely.

Thanks. ❤️"
1,I don’t know how to make friends. I really wish I was better at making friends and being able to keep them as my forever friends I know that sounds really corny but damn I really suck at being friends with people cause I don’t know how to not be anxious and nervous and worried about everything whenever I’m around new people also I hate silence makes me feel so anxious and awkward.. It sucks having no friends when you don’t even have a family either... im basically always alone .. and I always feel empty inside. 😔 I crave real life human interaction but I simply don’t know how to be friends with anyone cause I also have anxiety.. I just wish my brain didn’t feel like a huge foggy grey cloud
1,"Online therapy just made me feel worse than I ever have. To preface, I'm diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety, as well as a couple other things. For a while, I was in therapy, but the woman I was working with dropped me as a client out of the blue and practically fell off the grid. This was pretty hard to deal with to begin with, considering I was already having a hard time with the idea that anyone sees me as worth anything. So for a few months things were quiet and I just went on with life without therapy. Then the coronavirus quarantine started, so even if I found a therapist, we couldn't meet. Recently I've been having a lot of issues with relationships with friends, family, etc. because the progress I'd made in therapy began to really unravel. I realized that I was going to need help, so I started looking into online options. I found one that I thought would be good, went through the questionnaire, and clicked the submit button. At the end it took me to a page that said, ""thanks for taking the time to fill out our questionnaire. Unfortunately, based on the answers given, we feel that online counseling with us is not the best option for you."" 

Now I pretty much feel completely destroyed and really invalidated. I've got no one to go to, and it was already really hard for me to try this. I feel totally alone, and even though this is a small thing it destroyed any chances of me feeling confident enough to look for help."
1,"Trying to heal after a breakdown. I’m in the middle of a horrible depressive episode. I cried hysterically and screamed pretty much nonstop for three days and barely slept. Last night things got really, really bad. I finally convinced my husband, son, and ex-husband that I can’t do anymore. I have to stop and take care of myself, or I won’t be around much longer. I can’t do everything for everyone (I have some extremely needy men in my life!). 

So I was told to rest and they would take care of everything. Except they’re not. They’re letting my body rest when it’s my MIND that needs a break. They keep coming to me asking for help with computers, video games, what to have for meals, how to make the meals, whether or not they should buy eggs at the store or throw away a flyer for homeowners insurance (we rent an apartment). 

How can I communicate to them that I’m not capable of all this right now? You’d think that the fact that I start crying hysterically, pulling at my hair, and screaming “I can’t do this!!!!” when they ask me for help would be a good clue. But they still don’t get it. 

I’m in serious, serious trouble. I haven’t had a depressive episode this bad in years. To top it all off, my husband lost his job and we don’t have health insurance. I’m trying to take care of myself the only way I know how, but they’re making it impossible. 

What can I do?"
1,"Relapsed. I stated cutting again yesterday. I’d stopped for 3 months and then it just happened. It’s like an addiction- if you ever go back to it- you can’t stop again straight away. Yesterday I had 25 cuts, today I had 83. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think, but I’m too scared to admit my issues. Last time my mum saw my cuts, she told me I was stupid. Told me I wasn’t depressed while I cried and screamed. She told me I was only crying because I’d been caught. The only reason she found out is because I told my closest friend- she said I couldn’t keep doing this and told her. She thought she would help me. My mum never does. She threatens to put me in a nutty institute and when she finally promises she’ll take me to a therapist- she never does. I don’t expect her to help anymore. All she did was cause more pain, made it easier for me to self harm and allowed my mental state to deteriorate. I don’t know how much longer I can do this for. There’s one phrase that comes to mind which is, “ I don’t want to live, but I’m too scared to die.”
At this point it’s taboo to use it, but there’s no other words for it. I’m 14 and probably won’t make it to 16"
1,"is feeling neutral towards everything related towards depression?. like, i wouldn't call it numbness, it's just that i have no strong feelings, towards most things. e.g. when my therapist asked me how i found the session, i didn't know what to say because i have no feelings about it - it was just something that happened. and a lot of the time when she asks me things like ""do you want to improve on x?"" i just answer that i don't know (because there's not really anything i want). i also feel this way in most of my friendships; they're my friends and i ""love"" them, but i don't really get attached to or trust anyone. recently i've opened up a little to 2 of my friends, but it wasn't really about trusting them more, it's just i don't care if they tell people, because i'm not scared of losing friends. and i do want close relationships, it just seems like i'm unable to connect to anything. everything and everyone just exists, and that's all.

edit: just realised i wrote the title wrong, it's meant to be *related to, not towards. oops."
1,Fuck people. I hate those people who always complain about having “no friends” and yet when you text them nothing for day or weeks. That’s not all tho cause those “no friends” turn out to be ten times the about of friends you have and they know you actually have no friends. Yet they say shit like “same lol” when you say you have no friends.
1,"Something I thought of to help me through quarantine. I really miss a certain someone. I felt like just as things really went into lockdown I made a breakthrough with them. Being easily bummed, I’m trying to say “I can’t wait to see them” as opposed to “Oh god I miss them” or similar.

Idk, sometimes it’s the little things I have to look for through all of this."
1,"I need help please. I'm going to write this on my language because I need it to can communicate my real feelings.

1,"I’m thinking about suicide every day. Hey.  I want to talk a little about my life.  I am 20 years old.  In early childhood, I lost both parents.  The first 9 years of 11 at school I had practically no friends.  I walked alone, chatted with people from other cities on the Internet.  In the last 2 years of school I have changed.  made many friends, had fun with them.  Everything was the same in the first year and a half of the university.  Then bad things happened in my life.  I got depressed.  (I have a confirmed diagnosis).  For about a year I did not go anywhere except study and shop, rarely went for a walk.  I stopped seeing all my friends in real life.  Over the past half year I went to the party 3 times.  I forced myself to go there because I thought it would help me.  During this time, I began to feel worse every day.  It seems to me that people are looking at me because something is wrong with my face.  Every time I meet a girl I like, thoughts arise in my head that I am a jerk, and should not even think about her.  My mind makes me think that I am not worthy to be part of someone's life.  And I believe in it more and more.  I am not trying to find new hobbies for myself, because I am afraid that others will laugh at me.  But the worst thing is that for a long time, I think about suicide every day.  These thoughts arise completely suddenly.  Sometimes it’s enough for me to look at my face in the mirror, and my brain begins to think that such a freak as I am not worthy to even appear in public, and it is better for him to kill himself.  I am very much afraid, because every day these thoughts arise more often, and they are more and more detailed.  The only thing that keeps me here is my relatives.  I'm afraid to go completely crazy.  Now I am very lonely, I have not seen friends for many weeks.  All I dream about is a normal life, like everyone else.  But I feel that I will either commit suicide or die because my body weakens every day.  I don’t have money for a psychologist, and it’s unlikely that they will help me here, but at least I could speak out, and it became a little easier for me.  I have too many mental disorders, but I can’t talk about them in more detail, because the text is so very long.  Thanks if you read this."
1,"I invested everything I had into a partnership that came to a brutal end. I have very high expectations of myself and I've struggled to fulfil them. I have two, now three athletic careers to look back at that ended in failure just before I reached the goals I had respectively pursued for years with 100% dedication, training 15-20 hours a week.

I'm over thirty now and my last shot of making it was taken away from me because my partner (non romantic) decided that what I was delivering wasn't good enough. Our coaches thought it was going well but for her it just wasn't enough. I trusted her 100% and she revealed from one day to the next that she didn't see any future in us working together.

Instead of letting me go she kept me around for three months saying that just because she doesn't see a future doesn't mean there isn't any. That made no sense to me but I got so depressed that I just hoped it would somehow work out.

Three months later I finally packed my shit and moved back home. It's so crushing to have somebody you did everything for tell you she accepts that you did everything you could but it just isn't enough.

Instead of giving me a way to save myself she insisted on explaining why it's me that isn't good enough and that's the reason it's not working. None of this ""it's not you, it's me or it's us"" or whatever you say when you try to let somebody down gently. Then I got an email detailing all the shit that's wrong with me. All she wanted was me to validate how she was feeling which was that my best is not enough. How the fuck can she not see how cruel that is?

I had just quit my job to pursue this dream full time but that didn't matter to her either. She refuses to accept that you have some responsibility for the well being of a partner who depends on you. She sees nothing wrong with how she acted because it wasn't her intention to hurt me, just an unfortunate side effect. Hitler also had reasons and in his mind good intentions. That's no excuse.

She also said that I made her quit me by getting injured and being low on energy (because of depression I had just started getting treatment for). Maybe rape is the wrong word but I feel brutally abused and while it was going on I was told that it's my fault and shame on me for making her do that.

I'm usually good at processing breakups but this time I just can't. I got even more severely depressed and I can't get these thoughts out of head. How could she do this to me? Everybody thinks she's nice and a great person. This was my last chance of achieving the greatness I have been dreaming of for 18 years. I've never been this close and now I'm left with nothing. My whole identity has evaporated and now I don't know how to fill the void. There is basically no chance to find a new partner at this level so everything I've worked for is fucked.

To me it feels like failure to get a job and live a ""normal life"". It's not who I want to be but I'm out of options because somebody took my last option from me. Now I'm too old to do what I really wanted to do. Part of me refuses to accept this.

1,"I don't know what I'm feeling. DISCLAIMER: I know that self-diagnosing is not the right way to approach this and I am not at all self-diagnosing in the post below. I want to talk to a doctor but with all the COVID-19 stuff going on, it's not possible. I'm just reaching out right now for some help and I guess just to get an explanation for what I am feeling.

I am a 17 year old female.

In October, my boyfriend fell really badly. His parents weren't exactly there for him because they were upset with him about something. He wasn't my boyfriend at the time, but still my best friend. He fell on his back, broke his leg, had a concussion, sprained his wrist, etc. His back was in so much pain that he needed to be prescribed painkillers. He took oxycodone which helped with the pain a lot but the doctor actually overprescribed doses. He was taking more than he was supposed to without even realizing it. When the doctor did realize, he immediately canceled the next prescription he was supposed to pick up. He then started to experience withdrawal symptoms and they were BAD. At one point, I thought he was going to die. I used to spend hours taping his back, giving him the right medicines, helping him. Anytime that I wasn't helping him, I was just worrying. I know that what he was going through was horrible for him so I felt selfish ever expressing my feelings or telling anyone how stressed out and worried I was. Every time he told me a different symptom or something he was going through, I would just go to my room and cry and pray silently. I felt like it was selfish for me to worry in front of him. But, all the symptoms he had were things he just got lucky from not dying from. Since then, my attitude towards life significantly changed. He did get better but, he's still not perfect. I became a really negative person after this and basically just told myself that the worst case scenario was going to happen with everything in my life.

A while after this, we started dating. It was fine for a while and obviously we did what any teenage couple would (making out etc). But I have very strict parents. One day, they looked through my phone and found out about everything that happened while we were on vacation. They told me having a daughter like me was a mistake, threatened to kick me out, said I would be nothing but a failure in life. My father didnt speak to me for a while and it was a really difficult time for me. Despite how traditional my parents were, I had always had a close relationship with them and the stuff that they said to me in this time really really hurt. I'm playing down the things they said a lot out of respect for them but they were really really bad. It's something that I think about to this day. My parents have always held me to a high standard but some of the things they told me just put me down even more and increased this negative attitude I have towards life.

I went to my gynecologist for irregular periods and she asked me some other questions. I noticed that whenever my period cycle was about to start, I became super sad and detached and just went to a really bad place. I always thought it was PMS so I asked my doctor how to help with it. She asked me to explain some of my symptoms and after some time she said I could be experiencing PMDD (Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder) which is essentially a more heightened form of PMS, but can also mirror symptoms of depression. At this time, I was feeling different. I felt super sad a lot of the time and I really only talked to a couple people. Before this, I was probably the most outgoing and interactive person you'd meet. I was friends with everyone, out every weekend, and I also did really well in school. My junior year I got a 35 on the ACT and had a 4.5 GPA. But, once senior year rolled around, I had straight C's and really didn't care much about anything. I put all of this off as PMDD and my gynecologist did suggest going on birth control but my mother has always been against it so I didn't'.

In January, this sadness became increasingly worse. At this point, I really only talked to one person, my boyfriend. I tried to tell him what was going on but the words just couldn't come out of my mouth because honestly, even I didn't know what I was feeling. I just felt stuck and I just felt this lingering sadness and I didn't know exactly what it was coming from. One night, I began to feel like the room was spinning and I couldn't breathe. I started crying and struggling to breathe at the same time. I felt like I couldn't move almost. This lasted for about 25 minutes and after that I just sat there for a while. I became sadder and sadder the longer that I sat there and eventually I cut myself. If you asked me then, I couldn't have explained why I did that and even now I can't. It just happened so quickly. I just put a band-aid on it and forgot about it and didn't address it.

At this point, every little thing began to worry me. If I got a bad grade I thought colleges would rescind my acceptance. Everytime my mom called me downstairs I thought I was going to get kicked out. Everytime my boyfriend texted me, I thought something had happened and he was gone. Everytime anyone talked to me, I just couldn't hold a conversation and had no motivation to talk to them. It was senior year. This time last year, I imagined myself partying but here I am stressed about a hundred things that I have no explanation for.

The cutting continued. These episodes were I couldn't breathe or move did. I just didn't address it. I would try and get through it at home and put on a happy face when I talked to people in school. In March, I finally decided to address it. I knew I had to tell someone about it and reach out for help but I just couldn't. I was so embarrassed and honestly a part of me felt like I was just being overdramatic. I didn't know where this sadness was coming from. I constantly yelled at myself saying others have a lot more struggles than I do and I should be thankful. I was telling myself this, yet it still continued.

In March, all my friends began to hate me. They said that I ditched them for some boy and would ignore me every time they saw me. They'd talk shit about me to people, they used to flat out talk to each other about things that involved me when I was right there and never let me talk. It hurt me so much because I did not know what to do about it. One friend told me that I had never been there for her and I was a horrible friend that had no presence of mind or empathy for anyone. All this just hurt because before this year she was literally my best friend.

It was really hard for me to open up about this because even I didn't know what I was going through. But, one day I got the courage and talked to one of my friends about it and I apologized to her for not being there. All she responded with was, ""Everyone gets sad, you're not the only one. You think I wasn't sad when I didn't place first in track last week? It's always something with you"" and it just hurt me so so much. It had taken me so much to open up to someone and once I did she just put me down. And she discussed what I told her with so many people when all I was trying to do was confide in her and ask for some help. I decided then talking about it would help no one and resorted to cutting myself.

At this point, my boyfriend began to notice that something was wrong. He asked me and one day I just broke down and told him everything. I could barely breathe while talking to him and I began to say the same sentence to him, ""I don't want to be here."" Because honestly, I didn't. I kept telling myself. What was here for me? I'm not happy, my friends hate me, my parents will forever be disappointed in me, I didn't get into the college my parents wanted. There was nothing keeping me here. I just wanted to be gone and resorted to cutting. Once I told my boyfriend this, he was there for me. He used to stay on call with me for hours talking to me and comforting me. It really helped because after being put down by the girl I used to call my best friend, I just really needed some support. He was there for me every time he sensed something was wrong and I thank him for any improvement that I made. He has been struggling with depression since his injury so I didn't exactly know if I should open up to him knowing he had a lot going on that was worse than me.

Here I am today. I want to talk to a doctor about all this but I am not sure if its necessary. Am I being dramatic? Is all of this just me overreacting? Or could there actually be something going on? And if so, where could it have stemmed from? I was the happiest person last year and this year something just changed. I don't know what it was and I really just want some outside opinions right now. If you did read all this, thank you so much and any response would be super helpful to me."
1,"Narc Ex. Suicidal. Stuck.. I (25F) met my narcissistic ex husband (25M) five months before we were married. I know it sounds stupid.. But he was everything I ever wanted... And needed... And I seemed to also be for him.. I had faith.. 
Everything changed as soon as we got married and he became abusive and cold. Now it is almost nine months since I have been at my parents house... Still waiting for divorce to be over and done with.. But I feel so finished..

He was the LOVE of my LIFE... Abuse and all.. I got married for life.. For a reason... Not just to be thrown away.

I cannot get past it.. I cannot find anyone that can measure up to all he was to me... I had been so happy and alive.. I still cannot believe the change... I don't want to believe it... 

Now I have someone persuing me, and I want to open myself up to it... But all I feel is pain. And memories. And every night I just want to bash my head in to stop thinking so much about this. My new life was supposed to start and now I am just an empty shell of what I was.. I hate that he changed... I hate that I loved him so much.. I hate this stupid stupid life. I don't want to be here. Where I am is not where I'm supposed to be and there is nothing I can do about it.. I am drowning. And I am the only one who can feel the water around me. I'm done with it all."
1,"I realized how little impact im making.. Sometimes that this pandemic is making me realize is how alone and empty my life is. I had chemo and since have had to be quirintened for going on 6 weeks now and it just has shown me how little impact i make. My Mom, gma , a freind and 2 co workers have been the only ones to contact me to make sure im okay. I just dropped off the planet and this is it. Its all making me feel so alone."
1,"I literally have the creativity of a peanut. Depression has taken alot from me honestly. I used to draw, write, and play musical instruments all the time but now I can't even pick up a pencil without having a mental breakdown. Drawing and writing used to be a form of self expression back then, it helped me cope with my issues but now the pencil seems heavy. I need to recover my old hobbies and interest but it seems so difficult."
1,"The invisible woman: is it depression ?. I am not sure I have ever said this to anyone other than my abusive ex. I think I have depression, or severe mood changes? Honestly I don't know.

I am 10/10 afraid to share my true thoughts and feelings with basically anyone, I am so afraid ofettimf the world know me, I want to have connections with people but everyone has been so shit to me. I havent had a bad life, I played sports in college I'm averagely pretty, I have a great job, and I'm even going for my master's degree. However I cant help but feel like the world is against me, or that I'm invisible and worthless to everyone. I struggle everyday with feeling like I matter to no one. Sometimes I wish I would just die, but then i think of how devastated my parents would be, it would kill them really. I feel like my whole life is never mine, I feel the weight of other emotions so heavily that I am overwhelmed. Is is fear of disappointing someone? What makes me feels so worthless, even when I think I have so much worth to give?  What is this feeling of dying to give others help but unable to step from my crippling fear of remaining invisible even when I step out of my shell.... the only thing people ever noticed me for was how athletic I was, now I just feel as if no one sees me.  I don't think of suicide, but I think how over this life I am.

I am the invisible women."
1,"I just stuck in this pathetic limbo. I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do with my life. I’m stuck I. This pathetic state where I’m too depressed to live but don’t have the power to die. I get these depressive dips almost, where for about two hours I’ll get really sad, and nothing else matters, just kill me. But then I’ll have my common self, where I’m just kinda sad and fed up all the time, but not to the point of where’s I can’t get out of bed. Then I’ll have a 30 uplift, where I’ll not feel sad or anything,mane I’ll think how stupid and selfish I am for saying I want to die and shit when I’m not even depressed and bullshit like that. It’s almost as bad as the depressive periods, since it makes me feel more worthless, so when I go to my day-to-day I’m just that but more sad. I’ve been cutting my arm a lot more now, and I can’t stop anymore. I started cutting for control and relief, but they’re the two things I’ve lost. I’m considering it now. With genuine eyes. I think I’m in my day-to-day right now, but on the decline. I pray in my low point I won’t do sometching stupid."

I have people who love me, but i cant talk to them about how I feel, and when i try they brush it off as ""moody"" because im a teenager. I settle for less and I know i shouldnt but its not like theres anything ahead of me. I once trusted someone and told them I was about to kill myself. They called the cops (which I am extremely grateful for) and the cops questioned me, asking if i had a plan, etc. I just said what they wanted to hear, what my parents wanted to hear. I cant goto therapy because of the cost and i dont have anyone to talk to. So im here, ranting. I dont want anyone on here to ask if i wanna PM or whatever. No offense to you guys but i have trust issues, the only reason I can post this is because its not direct. I hate confrontation. So yea.... I just needed to write something out."

1,"I stopped. taking kratom and Effexor at the same time. I'm struggling to get through this.. I have schizoaffective disorder. I was taking kratom for the negative and cognitive symptoms, but that turned out to be a horrible idea. I couldn't moderate myself and just took way too much. So when I ran out I decided to quit. That was 4 days ago.

&nbsp;

At the same time I quit my Effexor. I had been on 75mg for 5 weeks. My doctor moved me up to 150. Two days into that and I was a mess. I think it was causing suicidal thoughts. I wanted to go back to being stable again, which I was much more so before I started taking the Effexor. So i stopped.

&nbsp;

I still take Wellbutrin and Latuda and Amitriptyline along with sleep meds and clonazepam as needed. But I'm falling apart. I've barely stopped crying for 4 days. I have suicidal thoughts nonstop. I can't sleep. And now I've got brain zaps and nausea.

&nbsp;

I don't know. I'm just not handling things well. I called my doctor and her assistant told me the best she could do was move my appointment from next Thursday to next Tuesday. That seems like forever away.

I don't even know why I'm typing this. Just to feel less lonely, I guess."

1,"Middle Schooler that can’t be productive. No friends and can’t make any more.. Just wrote my life story and reddit didn’t want me to post it and now it’s gone, I’ll summarize key points here.

-Three year old me wants to be a prodigy

-Elementary school me didn’t do that, but bragged about it enough to not have friends until fifth grade

-I made friends for first time but I was the loser of a basketball clique

-I am fat

-I go to middle school, basketball clique is no more. I fail to force myself in to a anime/meme clique.

-I get depressed and act 2010 meme cringey but this girl is nice to me and ends up being the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. Good grades

-Next year of middle school, my grades are good, I get in to a clique about Anime/Memes (different one), no depression and playing football. However, the nice girl is now in highschool.

-Winter break at cadet thing, all of my friends stopped laughing at my jokes and awkward silence. Two of them get real passive aggressive and we don’t talking very much but we all pretend that I’m still am friends with everyone

-Here we are, me not wanting to say I am depressed because I always thought depressed people need to get over themselves. On the internet too much, feuding with my parents, no friends, terrible physique and terrible grades. I miss the girl that was nice to me, I should have appreciated her more. I am really sad and quarantine is preventing me from making any new friends. I have turned to both YouTube for therapy videos and discord for friends, those have failed me. 

- I have a tall, wide frame. I know I’m smart. I have all of this potential and I just can’t motivate myself into anything anymore. I find myself wasting entire days doing nothing. I am not suicidal, but I’ve thought about it in the past.

- I find myself unable to get anything done anymore, ever. My grades suck and I haven’t been able to do more than one assignment every forty eight for the past few months."
1,"I'm starting to realize I have no passions, no talents, no dreams. Everything I used to love, I hate and can't seem to bring that enjoy back. Other than that, I have nothing. I just sit in my own self pity while hating everything around me. I don't want to be that person but like fuck. How bout you put yourself in my shoes and see how you like it. It's dark and disturbing isn't it? Like sorry I can't be genuinely happy like other people. Sorry I can't achieve the things I want to achieve. I've just lost all hope. Maybe I'm feeling this way because of being quarantined, but maybe that's a good thing because I'm seeing and understanding who I really am: a fucked up individual."
1,"I messed up (again). Since the quarantine happened, the depression that I tried to repress is crawling back in. I've been neglecting my works and disappointing many people. I don't know what to do"
1,"I can't understand what's going on with me. Maybe I'm just getting crazy.. It's night, and I'm just laying in the bed and crying.
All that situation with quarantine, just left me alone with my own thoughts. In the last days I just ignore my friends, school. Shit! I ignore my own life. There's my birthday in one day, but can't think it like a happy day. I don't know if I will be alive. The biggest shit, I can't talk about it to someone. While I am staying in Discord with my friends, I turn off the microphone and cry. I don't wanna die. I honestly don't wanna die. But I don't know how I must live my life. I wrote all this, just hoping someone will read it."
1,"Need advice on helping a friend. I’m sorry in advance if this post is long and I am so grateful to anyone who is willing to help 

My friend has struggled with depression for a long time, and they seem to be getting worse. I had a long chat with them recently and it is very clear to me that they are doing extremely poorly. They admitted to not being able to abstain from self harm at all, drinking to try and feel better, and saying that their life has no meaning and they will never be happy. They have a therapist who they don’t like and believe that therapy can’t help them. I don’t want to go into too many specifics because I don’t know if they use this subreddit, but I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m not doing the best myself so I feel as though I can’t give the best advice. Since we had this talk they’ve been even more distant and I’m getting really worried. We are both in our later teen years also so I feel really unqualified to help them. Their parents know that they struggle but they have never opened up about the self-harm or the fact that they are doing this bad. I don’t know if I should contact their parents or if that’s a bad idea because if not handled well it will only alienate them more. I’m at a complete loss for what to do. 

I can pm with more information if anything will help. If anyone has any useful advice I would appreciate it so much."
1,Am struggling to breath and there is no longer hope. 2020. The year I found out death really is the answer. If I wasn't afraid of the consequences of suicide I would have done it a lot of breakdowns ago. I can't wait until something ends me. Only way I'll be with my mother again. I can't wait. sweet sweet death.
1,"How should I handle this?. The last time I saw my crush of 5 years was after graduating. That was around 2017 and a year ago I pretty much cut all feelings for her after thinking about all the rejections (5 times in total over the course of these 5 years). Because I pretty much wasted 5 years on her I was just too blind to see and too weak to let go.
After I cut all connection and feelings in early 2019 my life improved sort of, not by much but it improved. Today while grocery shopping I met her in the supermarket. We exchanged smiles and a quick ,,hi,, before going on with our shopping. The moment I saw her all the feelings, anger and depressive thoughts that I had over the years came back instantly and pretty much continued to fck with my head. Now I don't know what to do anymore, what's the mission now? I don't want to focus 2 years on recovering not being able to do nothing due to depression and me getting eaten alive by my own thoughts like what happened after graduation...

How do I avoid thinking about the girl I had a crush on for 5 years now since 2013...

We somehow agreed to stay friends after grad but some time after that we pretty much became strangers to each other and now I don't know what to do...Should I just toughen it out like I'm used to until it goes away?

I can answer anything that I might have missed, in the comments if it helps to find an answer..."
1,"Woohoo, relapse. My mom knows the perfect ways to tear me right the fuck down. The only reason my arms dont look like barcodes rn is because I had to sit down stairs for an hour, so I just checked out. I dont remember any of that hour and now that I'm alone everything's flooding back and it's taking everything in me not to break a shaving razor rn. 

My best friend is texting me but I cant tell him I want to relapse. Hes so happy that I'm 4 months clean and I cant put pressure on him like that, he has a lot going on.

I feel like I'm just another teenager overreacting. I dont have a diagnosis, I have food and shelter and both parents, I'm ungrateful. I dont know."
1,"No motivation for online school. I've always had trouble getting homework done because of my depression. But with my school switching to online classes I am falling behind even more and I'm just ready to give up at this point.

I can't function in an online learning environment. There is just no way I can retain information like I would in a physical classroom. And I can't bring myself to start on homework until very late when I have to rush to get it done so it isn't turned in late. I waste the rest of my day watching movies, youtube, tv shows, etc. instead because nothing else brings happiness to me anymore besides that. 

I just cannot function without having the routine of waking up, getting ready, and going to school everyday. I would like some advice and want to know if anyone else feels like this. All my teachers are disappointed in me but most don't care about mental health so I can't tell them the truth."
1,"What am I supposed to do now. When I got 11 years old I got depression, I don't want to talk about why I got depression at 11 because it's kinda embarrassing.

At 12 years old shit got real... A lot of depression came from school. I can't do school work anymore because it's so frustrating.

I can't even do my hobbies anymore.

There's one other reason why I am so depressed, but I don't want to talk about it.

I'm still 12 and right now all I do in life is sit In bed watch YouTube videos or watch porn and masturbait.

I don't really know how to describe the stuff I'm going through.

 Also English is not my first language so my English might be bad."

1,Doctor on demand. Has anyone attempted to talk to a therapist via doctor on demand? I am having a hard time dealing with and processing my life events.

1,"What do you do when the place that drains your motivation the most is the place you’re trapped in?. That place is my room. The living room scares me because there were rats there not too long ago and I’m not convinced they’re all dead so every time I sit there I just get really anxious about the possibility that they’re around here somewhere. My parents’ bedroom is a mess. There is no backyard. There is no space. I only have my room.

My room is the place I stayed the most out of during my recovery. I only really came in there to sleep because being there makes me want to give up and just lay on the bed with my phone or sleep. 

Now I eat, get entertainment, do/did homework, and flipping go to school on my bed. 

And now I’m behind on a ton of my assignments because I can’t seem to get any motivation. I could feel my motivation slipping away and I tried to fight it but all of my solutions were really only short term.

Now I feel stuck literally and metaphorically"
1,"If you didn't make your best friends in highschool or college you're screwed. Or at least that's what it feels like. And I don't mean just making like ""friends"" or acquaintances, I mean good friends that you always want to hangout with. Those take a lot of time, you have to hangout a lot to build that type of relationship and nobody has time to do that anymore when you're an adult it seems. All I want is a group of friends to go on a roadtrip with. Or go to the beach with. I just keep comparing myself to my ex and his group of friends, and others I've met through him. They all have a group of two or three people who they do all this fun stuff with. But anytime I meet or see anyone with a group, its always people they've met in highschool or college. I don't understand, isn't there others like me? Why can't I find anyone that i really click with. "
1,"Quarantine and depression.. Ever since this whole COVID-19 thing broke out and people began to quarantine themselves, I've been fucking depressed. 

It began with an ""Oh, no..."" when I read the email from my university that school would be closed until MAY THE 31ST. Now, I am not exactly sure that I am depressed (am I depressed or just ungrateful?) but I do not at at all bode well with staying alone at home with absolutely nothing to do. There is slow internet, my computer isn't great with running games, and going outside is, of course, out of the question. 

It's almost been a month of waking up, doing nothing, going to sleep. One can watch TV shows for only so long. 

I've been depressed for almost three years now. Depressed in the sense that I have no real ambitions, passions or physical skills that can help me out. I also have this feeling that I will never be ""somebody"". To top it all off, I've been extremely underweight for my age, have been shamed by peers since grade 1, and generally have never had a moment to look back on with pride. 

I am 23 and live with my parents. I have not told them about my depression, they simply would not get it. I don't blame them, no matter how and what they've done, they're the best parents anyone could've asked for. But the problem is me. I feel unimportant. Irrelevant. I just fucking miss going to uni because it was an escape from doing nothing. 

I don't know, whatever. Just wanted to rant it all out."
1,"Not sure how to help girlfriend. To make a long story short we’ve been together for a little more than a year now and I love her to death. Whenever we’re together it’s been nothing but a good time filled with laughs and lots of food (lol).

Recently I noticed she’s been irritated with me and she said that she started to relate signs of depression to things she was feeling like feeling irritated easily, anger, self-loathing etc. also she would have the extreme thoughts of self-harm but she would never act on it. I tried to comfort her saying that I will be there for her and all that but that response turned around on me because I constantly tel her that. She wants a different response like how to comfort her or help her but I am at a lost for words and don’t know what to say. 

I love her and I can see us being together for a while and I really hope this is one of those challenges that we just face and get over.

Any help is appreciate thanks guys."
1,"So I guess making new friends is off the table now with the Covid19 situation. I don't really mean new friends, I have no friends.

1,"Worst day of my life. So the one friend that I can trust to talk about shit with, just told my parents that I’m suicidal. I’m not pissed at her as I know she meant well but now feel like I can’t trust anyone. I would have rather told my parents myself eventually as opposed to having them find out from someone else then barrage me with questions. It’s not their fault as they clearly have no idea how to deal with depression/suicidal thoughts but it’d like they managed to say every bad thing. Everyone involved just wants what is best for me but I can’t help feel angry at them all. It’s understandable as my mum thought I was happy for the last two years, but she keeps trying to tell me how it’s just temporary. She also keeps wanting to know how I self harm as my friend told her about that as well. It feels like everyone is against me and I’m just alone and I just don’t want to go on anymore."

I don't know why I started doubting my faith, but the fact is I don't believe in God anymore.  For 3 years I've been acting as if I did believe, and even if tedious, it hasn't been that difficult. Before proceeding, I need to say I've been suffering from depression and other issues. In the last year and a half approximately, I've been just getting worse and worse. I told my parents and they took me to a therapist ( thankfully), but my mom says that the efforts of anyone to help are futile without the help of God. I think I could go through with this and continue lying, but I also think I need to say the truth to her. Luckily, my mom and my dad have been trying to help me with my mood, and I really don't want to cause them more trouble. That's the thing; I feel like I'm tearing my family apart ( my mom has even said that because of me she wished she didn't live here, she's not to be blamed for that, though), and I don't want to cause them more trouble. Like faithful Christians, my parents' lives revolve around God ( especially my mom's). I'm really scared of messing this up and ruining everything. Any help will be appreciated."

1,"Waves of depression. I don't know if its just me but my depression comes in waves. Sometimes i would just wake up feeling like a pathetic loser after which I don't want to get out my bed. Sometimes, even the most obscure things triggers memories of my ex and absolutely wrecks me for days. Sometimes its just a feeling of emptiness and that feeling of ""what the fuck is even the point"". Then it goes away magically after a few days only to return days later.

Also, I've never been to a therapist so far because I feel that my symptoms are mild. But sometimes I just think everything would be so much better if life just ended right here for me. I am considering going to a therapist after the covid 19 situation calms down. Can someone explain how it seeing a therapist helps? Like what benefits does it bring assuming no medication."
1,"Who else?. Who else thinks biological life is just bullsh* and unfrair. I mean, I was depressed as a teen the whole time and then lager I improved myself and know how I can actually be happy.
BUT. I still think life in general sucks and has the most unfair and illogical things that if a God would exist, I would give him a soft smack for, like dude what the heck man..
I can love life but at the same time passionately hate it.
Like I was born with a neurological disadvantage called autism, yes I am very thankful that I found out about the gaps diet no plants and actually I am recovering so much mentally. But I still have little energy and just life in me like what the heeeeeeck. Why is this biological life so hard???
I just don't understand anymore and Im just damn mad because I hate being autistic and it gets me almost nowhere because it makes you slow.
Going so crazy right now like how am I even supposed to be thankful??? I mean yes I can litteraly make a list of 100 things right now but the feeling of irritation everyday just always takes over?


How???¿?

Sorry needed to vent.."
1,"Feel worse after depression medicine?. I had a strange experience today. My job was getting me down as usual, so I took my prescribed depression medicine. I know it won't kick in til later, and I have to take it regularly. Still, taking the medicine initially gives one a 'chill', kind of relaxing feeling.

Not this time.

Instead, I felt three times worse, to the point I started crying. I honesty don't understand this reaction, I've never reacted like this to any depression medicine. What's going on with me?"

I’m in college right now, majoring in something that will allow me to pay them back as quickly as possible (they didn’t ask for this; I just feel guilty for wasting their resources...). I’ve been struggling with depression since I was 7. Not sure why I felt like posting this today — it might be a bit of a rant after a couple of meetings where I felt like the dumbest person in the (virtual) room and this overwhelming emptiness that has been building up for a long time. My heart has been hurting since yesterday (it’s the feeling of having a sad, heavy weight on your chest to the point where it’s only slightly more difficult to breathe) and I thought I could sleep it out but I woke up like this too. 

(Internet) hugs for everyone here; I don’t know how I’m going to piece myself back together and get over the “you’re useless and disgusting” feeling but this sub makes me feel less alone. Thank you for letting me vent."
1,"Has anyone found a good ""depression hairstyle""? To stop it from getting too tangled?. This may be a stupid question, but has anyone found a good way to put their hair up so they don't have to worry about it tangling/matting during a bad depressive episode? I know it's better to just brush it, but that's so insanely hard for me when I feel like this. I just want some way to put it up where it'll stay and not get too tangled, and I'm not sure if anyone's figured out a good method"
1,"Work depression. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? I work 6 straight days every week and I absolutely hate it, I'm sad all the time even on off days just knowing I have to go back."
1,"Thoughts have been overwhelming lately. I’ve been having a hard time sleeping and functioning lately.  Every time I go to rest, my mind won’t stop thinking, whether it’s about a certain game, feeling, something I said that day that I regret, my mind will find any little thing to make me stay up... it even made me paranoid last night. Without proper sleep and some other thing going on with me physically, I’ve been in hard core depression and shut down mode. I know I made a promise to my friends to call everyday but this promise is getting harder and harder to keep. I can’t talk properly, I can’t think properly, it’s annoying my friend and it’s frustrating me. Sometimes I wish I couldn’t talk and that I could only speak through sign language. I’d love to learn but I’m too stupid to remember anything. I’m turning into a stupid failure. Nothing about my life is meaningful to anyone. I’m nuisance. I guess that’s all I’ll ever be..."
1,"How to get access to antidepressants without going broke?. My health insurance has a massive deductible so basically unless I am hospitalized, I pay for everything. I have done therapy in the past and although I learned a lot, I can’t afford to do regular therapy sessions. My job hours have been cut because of Coronavirus and having to stay in lockdown has taken a severe toll in my mental health. For the first time I feel I need to do something to change because I am getting hopeless. I am interested in trying SSRI’s and have done some research, but I don’t know what options are available to get a prescription in an affordable manner. Are there any online or call in options that have affordable appointments with the OPTION to write a prescription? I know there are some therapy options, but I would like to consider an Rs and don’t think psychotherapy alone is a reasonable option. Obviously I live in America, which is why cost is such an important consideration. Thanks!"
1,The only thing that calms me down when I get anxiety is telling myself I can kill myself.. This happens when I think of how miserable the future might be for me. Then I say it’s ok your going to kill yourself if it gets unbearable. Does anyone else do this?
1,Is it wrong to be mad at people who have a better life than you?. Not being selfish or anything but it only makes me feel sorry for myself for not having the same life as theirs and I absolutely hate feeling sorry for myself because I feel like I'm not worthy of self love
1,"My psychiatrist strongly recommended the hospital.. I don't want to go. I'm scared of the costs. I don't want my mom and sister to find out. They are my last line of stability. My last sense of normalcy. As soon as they found out, the relationship will change forever. My dad will want to be around more which is the complete opposite of what I want. My brothers will pity me. I dont want pity."
1,"I haven't slept in days. It's been a couple month since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.

Sorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.

Also I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.

My mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.

Edit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid."
1,"My point of view. Everything in my brain is telling me to find a mate. That's pure facts. 

Were all just animals...were peacocks going around and showing our feathers trying to impress a female peacock. So she'll want us. 

And from the females perspective I totally get it, you only spend time and chase after and desire men who have desirable products about them. 

I just wish I had some shiny feathers.

It's the same old game,  day in and day out. 

I'm sick of being the loser. 

I'm sick of knowing I'm the loser."
1,"Experiences with Viibryd or Cymbalta?. So far I've tried Effexor (no effect), Wellbutrin (no effect), and Zoloft. I took Zoloft at varying dosages, at some points alongside Wellbutrin. Zoloft helped with the extreme lows of depression, but I still felt significantly depressed in addition to feeling numb/flat, almost unable to fully experience happiness. I have been off medication entirely for around 6 months. In the last couple of months, I started going to the gym almost everyday, taking omega 3s, taking vitamin D, occasionally using light therapy, and trying to get my sleep schedule together. I was definitely still depressed but felt wayyy better than when I was on Zoloft. 

My mental health changed for the worse very suddenly though when an ex came back into my life (bringing up old wounds that haven't healed) at the same time this pandemic began. I ended up losing my job. I've been sleeping around 12 hours and once I wake up, lay in bed all day. I constantly feel like I'm going to cry, I've tried my best to continue exercising but I'm finding it very difficult. Yesterday I went for a walk/jog on a trail and ended up crying my eyes out (luckily I was alone in the middle of nowhere haha). I don't necessarily have a plan, but I think very often about killing or hurting myself. It's something I've caught myself fantasizing about often, even though I know it's not something I could go through with. 

I had a Facetime appointment with my PCP today. She prescribed me Viibryd, along with Zofran for the nausea side effects. She said if it was too expensive, we could try Cymbalta instead. I haven't gone to pick it up yet, but the Walgreens website says it's $71 with my insurance. I found a coupon I saw people mention online and am going to try to use it. I'm wondering though if Viibryd is worth the cost?  I've read good things about Viibryd from people who failed to respond to different antidepressants. I'm also wondering how people who don't respond to antidepressants like Cymbalta? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Is Viibryd worth the cost for people who don't respond to antidepressants? How does Cymbalta compare?"
1,"Anyone else “block out” certain parts or don’t remember details of when you were at your worst point/traumatic experiences?. My depression fluctuates a lot, like all of us. However, I came across some old postings of mine on a different site and I literally blocked out details of traumatic things that happened to me-maybe rewrote them in my mind to blame myself as well. 

There are also times my friends will ask if I remember how much I liked certain movies we saw together (or activities, etc) and I will tell them I haven’t seen them. They get frustrated because I have seen them WITH them yet I just can’t remember. 

At that point in time over a couple of years my depression was incredibly horrible. I was so close to ending it all, it scares me to think about. 

I don’t know if it was the looming depression, maybe the weed I was excessively smoking, or the heavy drinking. I’m just shocked by the things I don’t remember-little things and huge life changing details of bad experiences. I also find it odd because I study psychology and there isn’t really such a thing as “blocking” it out I guess.

Anyone else relate?  

TLDR: At the worst part of my depression and suicidal ideation, when I look back I can’t remember details of my life at that point. It’s unnerving. Is this normal? Anyone relate?"
1,"When will it get better? Did it got better for any of you?. I've struggled with depression since I was a teen. I've dealt with anxiety, destructive friendships, fear of going out of my house,bullying, a bitter divorce who left me as the only one to take care of my mom emotionally so I had to hide my feelings just to avoid my mom to get sad. In fact, when I finally hit rock bottom was so bad that I wished for my death. 

I've come out of them thanks to having friends and the improvement of the situation of me and my mom. But since, last year depression returned. First, it was realising how I chose a career that I ended up hating, then graduating and being unable to find a job. Then realising how my friendships had started to fade away as they are beginning to have relationships and it made me worry about a near future when I will be the only lonely guy of the group. 

It doesn't help that I feel my sexuality is a nightmare. I pray every night to be cured. I've been to lgbt groups but I just doesn't feel related to the things there, if anything it made me feel worse to be with people who put their sexuality as their main personality trait and it doesn't help that I live in such an homophobic country that coming out would cost me even the relationship with my mom, the only true love I have.  I don't think life would be better if I was straight as I already struggle with sharing my feelings and I'm not a very romantic person but at least I could live a normal life like the ones my friends are already having. Love is nothing more than an ilussion for sex. Isn't that's the reason why so many marriages fall apart?

And I don't think it will get better, if anything it will get worse as soon as my friends start to get married and having children. (In fairness, I would like to have a kid through adoption but I don't know if single parents can adopt). Having to live for a job I'll probably hate and now due to the economic crisis that the virus will cause around the world, my plan to study in Spain is likely delayed. I love my teenage years because at least being a top grades kid made my life have a meaning but now, it's sad to see even the kids who were my former bullies improving in their lifes. 

If I hadn't killed myself until now, it's just for my mom and dog. If something where to happen to her, I would likely have no more reasons to live."
1,"i’m losing myself again. i don’t want to be here anymore.. ive struggled with depression for the past 15 years and i’m not even 30 years old. i have tried to kill my self twice. it’s all up and downs. there’s months, or even years, where i am “normal”. and then there’s times where i just spiral and lose myself. i’ve sat on my couch and cried for an hour for no reason today. i am tired of feeling this way, i am tired of being okay for a while and then coming back to these feelings. why should i keep going if this is how my life will be? why should even be alive if i can never escape depression? if i can be normal and function for a while and then get back to this? it makes no sense. i don’t really want my life to be like this.
i feel like i am losing myself again. i don’t want to be “living”. i don’t know what to do. i am tired of all of this."
1,"I'm sorry I can't stop thinking. I've suffered abuse all my childhood: sexual, physical and emotional.  In the last few years I've been recovering from what happened to me, but I realized that it's a long path because the abuse only stoped when I was 17 and now I'm 20. Recently my anxiety has been through the roof and I don't know why. It's gotten so bad that I physically want to slam my head against a wall to stop thinking. I'm tired of being overwhelmed and I'm pretty sure my fiance and those around me are tired of dealing with me. I don't want to be a burden and I just want to get better. Thank you for listening and please leave some advice. I'm in therapy, but I don't think it's working....I hate taking medication."
1,"Does anyone else have an online shopping problem?. I’m pretty sure many people do, but to me, it gives me something to look forward to, even if it only brings me temporary happiness. I know it’s addictive and bad for my self-control and wallet, but it’s like I don’t have much to look forward to.

I was supposed to go to a school trip to Washington DC in May. That kept me afloat for a few weeks. But because of COVID19, that’s been canceled. I used to look forward to going to my Federal Work Study job at a nonprofit. I looked forward to the commute, eating out, and even working, because anything is better than being at home. I was looking forward to max out my hours to save up for the car I hope to get at the end of the summer. 

But nada, nothing. For now, the only thing I can look forward to is the temporary bursts of happiness I get waiting a package. After that, life just goes deeper downhill. It’s been like this even before COVID19. But I could look forward to going to classes. Now I feel like I don’t have much to live for..."
1,"I just don’t want to be here anymore. It hurts so much, everyday I’m in pain. My OCD causing constant over thinking. Almost every second of everyday I’m doing checking rituals. I have magical thinking which means I think I can make things happen with my thoughts if I don’t do certain stuff. I can’t enjoy anything because as soon as I do I feel guilty for stopping obsessing about the thoughts. Then I get intrusive thoughts about the thing. So I just flick back through the same apps everyday, stuck in my head trying to control my hole life. I try to go for a walk everyday but I’m overthinking the whole time. Literally anything triggers me. Any decision I try to make ocd comes in and tries to force me into something I don’t want to do. I want toast? No ocd wants me to have cereal or something bad will happen. I want to message a friend? ocd wants me to send exactly the right message, normally something I don’t even want to say. Then I end up talking and talking and probably annoying people.

Then on top of the is the feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough. From years of bullying at school. Then the guilt for the nasty ways I treated my friends because I wanted to look cool so made fun of them. Knowing if I didn’t my best friend would get mad at me. Saying I didn’t like her for hanging round with them.

And finally there’s the years of abuse from my alcoholic mother. Leaving me on my own at night. Coming home all bruised and bleeding. Forcing me to hug her when I didn’t want to. Calling me a freak, a bitch, telling me to fuck off. Gaslighting me constantly. Trying to kill her self in front of me and screaming at me to give her pills.

I’m just so broken. Life was getting better. My mother’s in prison now. I thought things were looking up but my ocd was worse. And then this lockdown and I’m backing to thinking “how do I do another potential 60 years of this hell that is life”

And I know this post is ranty, but I needed to get my feelings out. And no I’m not going to do anything. I’m too scared to kill myself. I don’t even want to die I just want the pain to stop. I want to finally be happy."
1,"If I am an introvert it sucks. This quarantine made me realise how much time I was wasting during my best years. And I still do that. I had so many similar days in the past when no one forced me to not go out and I still locked myself in without feeling the wind or the sun for days. I have lost so many days by just looking at the ceiling, getting late on purpose, looking at stupid crap videos on internet or lame celebrity news. I feel so bad. I feel like I'm constantly wasting time with non important things but in the same time I cannot do anything productive. Untill now, whenever I stayed hours after waking up, getting late on purpose and trying to continue a dream or just hiding under my blanket and trying to postpone the moment I have to get up, I thought it's because I had to go somewhere and have a responsibility. But now I don't have to do anything and I am still frightened. I have to do some work and I have deadlines but at least I don't have to leave the bed to do it. Or to meet people. And I still get that anxiety every morning even if I'm all alone and I can make my own schedule. 
 It's like two persons inside me fighting constantly. The one that wants me to be productive and do all the things I've postponed because I said I don't have time and the one that wants me to stay away from everything and just don't use my brain at all. It's been almost 2 months since I am in quarantine and I wasted my time completely. 
I hate this shit."
1,"I’m pretty depressed... Recently my psychiatrist gave me the diagnose of mild autism. Besides this I suffer from depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, ocd and agoraphobia. With so many mental health shit that’s going on, I am starting to get more depressed and asking myself if it’s worth it to go through all of this. I haven’t had a single day where I felt actually good without any worries in years. Life is exhausting and I am struggling to even get out of bed right now. I want to cry, but I can’t, because I’m emotionally not in balance. Besides everything, I can’t even name a single good thing about myself anymore. I feel like I’m totally out of place in this world and I have no purpose at all."
1,i love you. i should have left you alone the first time you left me. you did the right thing im sorry im so selfish. now when i leave it's forever
1,This pandemic makes me want to kill myself. I mean it when I say it it makes me want to end my life. It makes me feel like life has no meaning anyway and I really can't find any reason to live at all. Why even get out of bed? Every day is the same. Im losing it. I know Im not being rational but I cant help it. I cry everyday. My mom is out of work we barely have money to eat. I just can't see any way I will ever get out of this situation. I guess it's a dead end for me guys.
1,"How do you get motivated?. I’ve hit rock bottom. I’m starting to honestly believe the world will be better off without me. I stopped taking my meds, I’m ready to stop going to therapy. I don’t have a reason to fix myself anymore.

1,I hate myself. I'm back at square one and I can't escape this time
1,"I feel like I’m keeping a secret.. No one in my life knows I’m depressed, I guess I just have been for so long that I’m good at hiding it. I don’t know how severely it is, but it goes from almost killing myself to feeling relatively normal within a week. I know everyone has advice to tell people but I don’t see how that will help? I’m a teen so I still live with my family and everyone is bad mental health wise to so I feel like if they know they’ll hit all unravel. My brother is depressed and is making it VERY known, so I don’t want to take away from that. My mom has had breakdowns in front of me sense I was a child and I act like a therapist for her. I’m not sure she’d even believe me. My sister is the oldest but has mild autism and can be very cruel. I just work so hard to keep everyone together and okay but I feel like I’m keeping a huge secret! Sorry for the rant, it’s just I can only talk about it here."

I also had 100s of friends online but now just appear offline and only have a few friends who I speak to a few times a month but we dont do anything together, I pref people that do there own thing and speak nonsense sometimes.

I lost all my interests in real life+online and only stick to 1 game and music and haven't taken care of my health in 12 years. I can just sit here doing NOTHING and thinking about shit all day aswell."
1,"anxious and probably schizophrenic thoughts? idk but needed to write this down. I’ve been wondering what my real reason for committing suicide would be. I’d like to think that depression itself isn’t that big of an issue for me and wouldn’t be the reason for potential suicide.

I feel like if I ever did it, it would be because of the constant arguing and switching in my head, and also my consistently worsening grip on reality. It’s driving me insane and I hate living like this. This is mostly a post I’m making while having anxiety, so no I’m not talking about committing suicide right now I’m talking about the future.

I have a LOT of potential, and I have a lot of plans and methods that could get me successful and rich in the future, I know that and I know other people have told me that, the problem is I have no motivation to. And even if I do, first of all I’d have to get better.

What if I get better, end up thinking everything is fine, I move on with everything and eventually find a girlfriend, and I relapse into these same thoughts? Even if I do get better, I’m going to constantly live with the fear of a trigger activating and me lashing out.

The only reason I am seeking therapy right now is because some people believe I can be helped, even though I continue to believe I’m completely out of reach and beyond help at this point. I think there really is just a point where someone has been through so much that nobody is capable of helping them. 

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a big deal if I didn’t have certain triggers, because then my dark thoughts could be easily drowned out, but no, my mom had to be a despicable piece of shit and treat me horribly. And of course, dad was never there, and when he was, he was raping my mom and forced me to watch, so god knows what fucking psychological impact that had on my brain.

I’m not sure I can even push this shit out of my head. I’ve tried overpowering my triggers and telling myself “it’s fine it’s whatever it doesn’t matter you’ll get past it” and it just makes the triggers worse. 

It’s to the point where any amount, even an insignificant amount, of any representation of anxiety from rejection and abandonment, can set me off. Even if I wasn’t self isolating, I legitimately don’t understand basic, normal human interaction and I can barely even talk to anyone properly. I don’t know what normal friendships and relationships are. I’ve never known, and I don’t know what love is and I can’t love, which I’ve explained before I think.

Sorry I can’t really stick to one train of thought with these posts. I’ll be really surprised if someone can somehow get into my head, get past all the split personalities, get past all the manipulation and lying and fake personas, and convince ME that I can get better, that life is worth living, and that someday I won’t feel like such a danger."
1,"Just need to say this to someone. I am in my mid 20s, working and going to Uni(atm online courses bc of corona)  
I feel ashamed for writing this, but my mind is full of dark thoughts at the moment and I just want to get it off of my chest before i suffocate.

I am stuck at work at the moment I might need to put up an all-nighter since last week I could not get out of bed and I have fallen behind with Uni and work stuff. To be honest I am falling apart but I am a pretty good actor, so no one has noticed. My depression comes and goes, and this time its horrible. My whole body feels heavy, especially my chest, I can feel my heart pounding the whole time. 

My thoughts are racing and the only thing that I want is to go to bed, hide my head under the cushion, and cease to exist. The worst part is this feeling in my head and eyes.   
Do you know that feeling that you get when you are emotional, seconds before you start crying?  
Like when you are cutting onions and you try to hold your tears back. For some days I have been constantly feeling like that. It is truly horrible. I want to scream, hit the wall with my head until it stops and then some more.  
Aside from that I am a fucking Idiot, due to some stupid decisions I now only have around 15 euros in my bank account. I truly loath myself. If I could somehow get out of this body and be in the same room with myself, I would beat me up until I showed some of the drive that I used to have in my teens.  


My thoughts are not even that consistent at the moment. I can feel insanely sad and angry and then suddenly feel as dry as sand emotionally.  


I wish I had someone to share this to be honest, I wish I could would feel loved.   


As the sun is setting down and I am here alone, I have this faint voice that tells me to jump outside the window. But shit, have you ever tried jumping outside a window? Your whole body freezes and you can not move any muscles. Your hands get all tingly and sweaty, your skin cold. You breath slowly but heavily. Memories start to pop up in your head, of people who love you, mom, dad, friends.  


I will never give up on life though.  
I do not know if there is anything after death but I doubt it, I believe it to be like going under anesthesia, devoid of consciousness one returns to nothing. And that is a truly sad but also reassuring thought."
1,"Quarantine threw me into a depressive state. I haven't felt this low since back when i was addicted to pills and sat in my dark ass room all day getting high. This quarantine shit is real bad, i'm spending everyday in the same room I would be sad in. I miss college and seeing my girl. Fuck this house and my family. I'm sure lots of people feeling this way too."
1,"Progress concerns. I have been in and out of therapy for 3 years but my slow progress with my current T has been discouraging me from coming in because it feels like I’m not getting better. When Im in therapy, It feels so uncomfortable looking at each other when none of us know what to say. My poor memory makes it very difficult to talk about anything. How can I talk about anything when I cant remember anything? Im just forcing things out. This makes me start thinking that Im wasting my time and money which makes me feel guilty about going. I get out what I put in. I write long notes before each session but It dosent always help the conversation going. My low tolerance for frustration, poor motivation, impulsiveness, pettiness, unrealistic expectations and crazy work schedules has made it difficult for me to be in therapy at times.

When I first started I thought that I could just show up and have my therapist make me feel better. I thought that I could quickly get rid of my suicidal thoughts after a few months, recover from withdrawal and never look back on seeing a therapist/pdoc ever again."
1,"I'm not sure if I can even finish this semester. Hi guys, I'm sure my story is pretty common around here and I know that it isn't as bad as it could be, but I really don't know what to do.

I'm a junior in college and this semester has a few of assignments coming up. I'm not sure if I can even do them. I have a hard enough time getting out of bed to eat. I have no idea how I'm supposed to tackle some of these things. 

I'm just lost. When I think about anything that's due, I just sink lower in my bed. There are plenty of other things I need to do but I just don't think I have the energy anymore.

I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything i havent been sleeping because i only have fucked up dreams. Nothing feels real whenever someone tries to talk to me i have extremely bad dissociative episodes that last anywhere from 20-30 minutes. My dad and his girlfriend treat me like 2nd class as if im not worth anything and im just so sick of it im so tired of trying to be a normal fucking person this is all just too much for me to handle half the time i dont feel anything then the other half my emotions are controlling me. I feel like the empty shell of what used to be a person. People kept trying to bite away at me and leech off me to get what they want out of me but its happened to persistently that theres nothing left to take i feel like i died a long time ago and im in hell now. I cant even cry theres no tears left. I dont know what to do."
1,"Fighting... Im Fighting. I keep fighting it but I don't know why. I'm so tired. I'm stuck in a cycle. I fight through everything, nothing comes easy for me, this world isn't made for me. I fight through my school work even though I know I'm doing it wrong and I don't understand anything. I dread the tests, they destroy my confidence in myself. Music is my escape. At this point idk why I'm writing this. If this gets posted idk why I posted it. I'm a mess. I don't wanna think about the future, I'm scared. What do I do? I hate this. I'm angry and what to cry at the same time. Why does it have to be like this? Will it get better? Just please tell me everything will be alright. Why am I writing this? Why am I going to post it? Why? Why? Why? I will shine one day, and everything will be fine. Please someone tell me it is going to be alright. If you read this whole thing, thanks. Bye for now."
1,"Fuck.. Just... Fuck. I can't take this. I am not gonna commit suicide but... Fuck. Fuck me, fuck them... Fuck IT. Fuck the pain, fuck the wheight. The... You know IT. That thing that makes you wonder how you are still alive, how could you survive all this time without killing yourself. Fuck this feeling. Fuck this... Wound, this... Hole, that is in my chest. It seems... Permanent. Immortal. Fuck it. Fuck it."
1,"My girlfriend needs help.. Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. 

Reddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I’d support her no matter what."
1,"I almost fked up or did I?. So little bit of context: my grandparents come from a small mountain village where the head of the family decides everything. That behavior continues even now in Belgium. Now my mom who cares for my grandparents is always mad and takes it out on me...

Story: me and sister(sis)

Me: I going crazy from grandparents shouting 
Sis: just keep calm and help mom with dishes and chores.
Me: no why would I she's always mad and ungrateful.
Sis: well maybe you should wake up earlier that would help

(I almost sent) 
Me: honestly I don't know whether I even want to wake up.)"
1,I think I get worse everyday. Today I woke up and felt a bit better. I didnt feel depressed much but after a few hours I feel like I want to die again :/ ( Was like this before the virus)
1,"Anyone else feel like this pandemic and quarantine was a kind of low blow?. I've had depression for a while, pratically since middle school (I'm 21 now btw) and just recently I was actually having a good time with life and wanted to get out of bed. I felt comphortable around people and for the first time in a long time knew what I was doing,, I was dare I say it actually happy for a bit. But then the whole quarantine thing happened and it kind of sent me on a downward spiral of what the best way to describe it is sort of loneliness and self hatred. 

The main thing that kind of started said spiral was when none of my friends ever called to check up on me, it's something minor and so so petty I feel like a fucking 13 year old girl talking about it (No offense to any 13 yr girls out there, I'm talking about the sterotype.) And I feel wrong for being bummed out by that. 

So I guess to sum it up or a tl;dr, was anyone else kind of a bit happy before the self isolation/Quarantine.

(Sorry that none of this makes sense, I just really needed to write this down and tell someone, even if it was to a bunch of rando's. Thanks for reading this far)"
1,"Why can't people understand that they should leave me. I don't get it. I just don't get it. What possible fucking reason would anyone have for actually caring about me? What on God's green Earth could I possibly give back in a relationship? I'm annoying, I'm clingy, I'm attention seeking, I yell and scream at the drop of a hat, What possible benefit could they see in me? Sure, ***maybe*** I have some strengths (not even sure about that tbh), but they don't outweigh my flaws, and they aren't exactly useful in a relationship (I don't think anyone wants to be my friend because I can write a decent paper). So what the fuck is it, then? What could they possibly see in me that makes dealing with all my bullshit worth it? 

It's like I have a bomb strapped to my chest that's about to go off; I keep on telling people to get away or they'll get hurt, but they just refuse to acknowledge the bomb's existence. 

I'm just so tired of explaining this to people."
1,"experiencing intense emotions all day :/. my emotions have been all over the place today. i feel like a fking yoyo. ive literally gone from feeling on top of the world happy to super upset/angry/nervous to laughing to crying to angry again to overwhelmingly lonely... i have an app that tracks emotions on like a graph and there are so many sharp spikes just in the last 24hr period because i try to add stuff every time i feel something or when something happens. the last sort of month tho, the graph looked mostly flat and in the lower third of the graph but today its clearly very different. sure some stuff has happened today but only small events nothing huge that would warrant for intense emotions so its annoying or maybe stupid to be reacting intensely over little things, even when its a positive reaction? i also hurt myself today to uh lol thats another fun thing to add todays list of events. and im literally so tired! its so tiring to go from happy about one event to another situation making you really upset or mad to something else making you feel happy again. im exhausted! and like sure... IM NOT FEELING NUMB TODAY so thats a good thing, right? i shouldn't be complaining about this or even recording its existence because feeling something is better than not right? 
ive been complaining a lot about feeling numb resently and today its almost like ive felt enough intense and extreme emotions for atleast a month. maybe all this time ive felt depressed lonley or numb ive just been saving up all my other emotions just for today.  but it really doesnt feel like a good thing i dont think. sure, good that im not numb and sure ive been happy today but ive also felt really low too. how do i really know how ive felt today when my emotions have been crashing all over the place? i literally cant work out what my average emotion is for today but i can tell you that i am now exhausted. this is all so annoying."
1,"Does anyone else cry over stupid stuff?. I literally called my doctors office to ask a question and the lady kept interrupting and wouldn't let me finish what I was saying. It's no big deal, I'm sure she just wanted to hurry up and get me off the phone because she was busy. But as soon as I hang up I start tearing up for no reason at all. Like, it shouldn't be a big deal, but I cried involuntarily anyways. Just wondering if anyone else cries over little things that shouldn't matter?"
1,Im going to kill my family if they stay home. I hope this pandemic ends soon so everyone goes to their stupid lives so I can have a few hours alone again
1,"Mother died. Going crazy from guilt/regret.. My mother had cancer for 3.5 years and had already gone through one bout in hospice, which she eventually left because she got so much better. I think her long illness and repeated improvements lulled me into a false sense of ""theres still time"".

My mother was put into hospice again on Friday April 3rd and told she had a ""few weeks"". This time I knew it was for real. I saw her on Saturday and on Monday and she seemed to be doing pretty well and she texted me on Wednesday saying that she felt she was going to linger a week or two more. Instead she died on Friday the 10th. 2 days after that text. She was only home a week before she died.

My sister flew in to be with her the second she was released from the hospital and put into hospice. I work in an ER so I am considered high risk in these COVID19 times so I just visited 2 times from the day she came home from the hospital to the day she died and both times I had to maintain some distance, I couldn't hug her, and my sister didn't want me staying very long (1-2 hours). I tried to see her on Thursday but she said she was too tired for a ""visit"". So I finally got fed up with not seeing her more and I applied for FMLA so I could be with her 100% until she died. Make more memories. Take care of her. Not just be a ""visitor"" but be her \*daughter\*. But the day I FINALLY decided to do that, the next day, thinking she had at least another week for me to be with her, she suddenly crashed and died. I waited too long. WHY DID I WAIT AT ALL? Why didn't I understand how little time she had left? Why did it even matter? Why didn't I call my work the second she got released from the hospital and said, ""I'm not coming back to work until she has passed, no matter how long that takes"" or just quit and told them to use my PTO to cover my last 2 weeks. The stupidest thing is, I was going to quit my job soon anyways because I'm going to grad school. I think I just got hung up on being afraid to lose my health insurance, or being unemployed for months, or thinking I couldn't be gone for weeks (when i thought she would last weeks). But none of those things actually mattered. I didn't even have a financial incentive to stay because my dad told me he would cover my expenses until I left for grad school if I wanted to quit. I thought about FMLA but didn't apply for it until it was too late.

I managed to get there in time to say my goodbyes, I got to tell her I loved her and she managed to say it back, and I stayed with her in her final hours although she was heavily sedated. But I cant forgive myself for not being there with her in those last days. I COULD'VE BEEN THERE, getting hugs and watching tv with her and saying goodnight to her in person every single night.....and I wasn't. She probably thought I cared more about my stupid fucking job than her.

I just don't understand how stupid I was. Why did I keep delaying leaving my job, when I was going to quit soon anyways? Why did I assume she had weeks, I should've known she could die at any minute? Why didn't I press my sister to let me be there more? Why was I ever content with ""visits""? Why didn't I even consider being there 24/7 until it was too late?

I have no real good excuse for why I didn't quit, why I wasn't there with her. I honestly don't understand what I was thinking.

I could’ve been there and I wasn't. Day after day. I'll never be able to forgive myself. All the time and memories lost. I could've gotten hugs. I can't even remember the last time I got a hug from my mother because of COVID19.

I'd give anything to go back. Anything. I feel like I’m going insane from the regret.

I miss my mom."
1,"Opinions/guidance needed. I'll just jump right into it.

My family wants to know my drugs history. Should I tell them? 

I asked for assistance long ago to help with my depression from all my family. The first thing they asked was what's ""mind altering"" drugs have I taken.
I said nothing believing that drugs isn't what caused my depression, but in fact my family. This is when my anxiety went through the roof. I just wanted to tell them it's their fault. 

Now after the long period of time of receiving no help I just want to text my family the list of drugs and then see what they do.

Is this the reason they have been so useless in dealing with my depression. Is it worth the shit storm that will follow?"
1,"What does your depression feel like?. Describe your experience of depression using a metaphor.

Here’s mine:

I convince myself I’ve made the world quite haphephobic. I take up far too much space to steady the nervous, staggered breathing of an earth which seems to desire nothing but twenty one years’ worth of distance from my heavy limbs; an earth in need of separation from my desperately broken mind and body."
1,"Need for advice. I have a boss who to takes every opportunity to make me look like an incompetent in front of the Partners. I am on my trial period, and I am worried that she might give me a bad review, especially since every company is cutting part of its personnel, do to the COVID-19 crisis.

How should I handle the situation? I am working as hard as humanly possible, and I haven't  confronted her. I have been really polite and warm. I am trying my best not to ""poke the lion"", but I am not able to think straightforward anymore.

Can anybody give me an advice on how to deal with others? This has been a pattern, I have to admit, in previous jobs. However, this time I  am aware of my weaknesses, I am doing therapy to handle my social anxiety, and I am conscious and very careful in every word I say, and everything I do."

We are only allowed to head out to get essential items and have to be home all the way. 

or if you are an essential worker. 

i am tasked to head back to work every two days once, which very tiring to be honest the days i am not allowed back to work, i have to work from home. 

on top of that, I HATE STAYING AT HOME. I simply hate it. It makes my thoughts worst. 

i am never happy at home... even though home is supposed to be the happiest place in the world.

I have bought up to 40 random games on steam which all of which i can only play for an hour. 

Otherwise, I get annoyed and my thoughts run amuck. I have tried everything i could from netflix to weird online courses. 

At least i get to head back to work every two days once.

I dont know how would i cope with this....

I am sure i am not alone and there many of us out there...

Just wanted you to know you are not alone. 

Hope this ends soon </3"
1,"Quarantine depression. I’ve never been truly depressed until now I feel. I’ve had terrible anxiety and consistent derealization for the past 2 years but I cope. But holly this quarantine is hitting a new lever of depression. It takes me hours to get out of bed. When I do I just feel like breaking down. My girlfriend who is everything to me is going through the same thing but much much worse and I’m always worried about her. She calls me because I’m the only one who genuinely helps. Now in her defence, she is literally amazing. She cares about me so much and doesn’t just shove her problems onto me she goes slow with her issues and only talks about it when she really needs to. Anyway but now her parents forced her to take a night shift at a paper rout job from 1:00 to 5:00 am. I’ll barely be able to talk to her and her being what helps me and me being what helps her isn’t going to end well. I’m very much ranting right now and completely lost my train of thought but holy shit this quarantine is not going well."
1,"My story.. Hello.

I didn't know if this is the right place, but I just need this to be heard.

&#x200B;

I am 15, and I right to you from the middle of a coronavirus lockdown. Luckily, where I live my country has been very proactive and has a had a low fatality rate, but that is besides the point. The national quarantine has given me time to reflect on my life and I don't know what to do with my findings.

&#x200B;

I come from a very loving family, who gave me the best life and love possible. But for as long as I can remember (until recently, more about that later) and according to my parents I had anxiety starting at age 2. This impacted me on a completely different scale that I can't barely begin to describe. I hated myself. I hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I walked. You name it, I hated it. This day to day alienation of myself as a person stopped me from living a normal child's life. I never signed up for sports, or for music or nothing. I never had the confidence to even take the chance - because I always felt that I was so wrong the less chance I had to be wrong the easier my life would be. I would turn down birthday parties and other social events because I didn't want to say something or be judged or make a bad impression etc. I remember in my first year of primary school, we were played this movie about an orphanage, who had a caregiver who banned all stuffed animals and teddys (probably not the best movie to show to a bunch of 5 years old). This lady hated them so much she would burn them and make the kids watch. I can vividly remember coming home that day, quiet, acting like it was a normal school day - but there was one thought I could never clear my head off. The burning of the toys. It wasn't until that night and from memory about two months after where I would hide my stuffed animals under my pillow when I went to bed, and kept myself awake - on guard almost in case such a thing happened to me as well. That is something my parents never found out about. At the age of five, I can remember being worried that my house was going to burn down in my sleep, to the point where I would keep all my most treasured belongings in plastic bags, ready to flee the house with. I can remember being scared that someone was going to murder me in my sleep or kidnap me and hold me hostage till the day I die. I suffered from much more intense and violent nightmares than my peers. The thing that I am still confused about, is that despite that I lives in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country and had a caring family, was that I still suffered from these things. I was so worried about things getting broken or something going wrong, that despite how desperately I wanted something to work or happen, I was too scared of failure to even try in the first place. I was always trying to be the happy/friendly kid, just for the sake of everyone else which made sadly too much sense at the time, but now it makes no sense..

&#x200B;

Like all people (i hope) we carry burdens. My burdens was that my grandfather died when I was seven, due to cancer. The day of his funeral, I was asked by my parents if I wanted to go and I was so worried about looking weak and upset, that I went to school like it was a normal day, while the rest of my family faced something I can't even imagine now. I remember hating myself for years and years over that decision, because I loved him to bits and I never got the chance to say goodbye. My only memory of him is me returning home from school that day, and my dad showing ""program"" and me seeing his photo on the front page. I have never been to his grave since because a) I am to scared to ask my parents where it is because I am worried about opening up and b) the fear that it will worsen my feelings now. My lack of attendance at his funeral ate me away inside for years, I remember weeks on end where I would cry myself to sleep in silence each night, but never told my parents and still haven't. It was only when I had a breakdown in I think at the start of Grade 8 when I only told my mum half the story, the regret. Not the amount of pain it caused me. I don't think I'll ever be able to tell them because it sounds just too pathetic. 

&#x200B;

It wasn't the middle of Grade 8, that I began to get a grip back on my life. At my school, in eight grade it was compulsory to take a performing arts subject, this could either be music, art, drama or dance. You could either do two arts for one semester each or one for the whole academic year. So I choose 1 semester of drama and 1 semester on dance. I only choose these because I didn't know what else to do. These classes were mixed gender, which I found really hard because for Grade 1-5 I was at a mixed gender school and then 6-7 I was at a boys only. I found it hard because I had barely settled in and any sense of security or even a wall to hide behind was completely removed. I found the first few weeks of the course really hard, could barley look anyone straight in the eyes and mumbled my way through every social situation, even if it was a simple ""Hey! How are you?"". I just couldn't do it. I remember considering dropping out and changing to music, and my mum said to me ""Just give it some time, it will be fine."" And I have been so happy that I listened to that advice. I owe my happiness and emotional freedom in life to my drama teacher, she pushed me and pushed me, to achieve confidence and it payed off. It was so successful to the point where I changed to a full year course, took for the whole year in Grade 9 and the same in Grade 10. I even signed up for the school's musical which sadly got cancelled, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

However, despite that I now have been dealing with the same sort of issues/dreams/constant pessimism again like when I was five. Recently, I have been so worried about death due to the coronavirus that on a frequent level I am having dreams involving comas, death of whole family etc. I seem to be more and more often wishing I wasn't who I am. On a frequent scale, I think to myself ""Imagine how good my life would be if I was born in the UK"" etc. Sometimes I wish I am a celebrity or sadly just someone who gets heaps of attention. 

&#x200B;

I know that I just dumped a lot of stuff on you guys but here are the main questions I need answered please:

&#x200B;

* How do I make up for that lost time, I spent worrying about everything?
* What do I do about my grandfather.
* What do I do about wishing I was someone else.

Like I said, I don't know if this is the right place, but your input would mean so much."
1,"Working in a warehouse makes me want to die. I work for an online retailer/shipment company. Idk if I can name them or if that's not a rule here, but they start with an A.

Anyways, I have fibro and am in  pain constantly. I submitted an accommodation request and had my dr sign off on it for a minor part of the job. They ended up denying it because I wasn't technical enough. I was feeling depressed enough working there already, but this really adds on to it.

For those of you who don't have fibro, the cold is excruciating and I'm more prone to injuries in the cold.

I haven't been back for a month and I'm finally going back today, but I'm scared. I've been crying about it all morning and I'd rather do anything than go back to that hellscape. The thought just fills me with so much despair. I've been in a depressive funk already bc of the covid crisis, so it's all piling on.

Just thinking of stepping through those barred, rotating doors makes me want to die. It all just fills me with so much dread."
1,"In a failing relationship with severe depression. I’ve (20F) always struggled with mental health but in the last year and a half, my depression got severe to the point of suicide being on my mind at all points of every day. I’ve been living with my boyfriend of over a year for a few months and found out recently that he had been buying nudes from some random girl on Snapchat (not even a hot celebrity, just some girl that lives in our state). I already had no hope, no love for myself, no trust for him, etc. and really don’t know how to cope. I’m not going to leave him because I feel like I don’t deserve any better and wouldn’t have a better relationship with someone else anyways. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Especially with being cooped up all day everyday during quarantine with him."
1,"I hate my life. I’m fat. I’m worthless. And I’m a loser. My brother even says that my mom thinks I’m obese. He told me they might have to put me on fasting. I don’t even eat that bad. It’s just that it’s so hard to workout during quarantine. My family’s gym is closed so I can’t do a class there. And the zoom classes are always when I do school. My family always wants me to do stuff around the house and whenever I try to do something I usually get yelled at because of some little mistake. My brothers hate me. I’m failing science (a C is considered a fail in my house My brother and I have to have at least all B’s).  I’m sick of quarantine. I just want it all to end. I have had thoughts about how I’m better off dead but then I’m all like “I can’t die yet, we have t gotten a sonic adventure remake.” But even then that’s not enough. Whenever I get depressed around my family my dad just tells me to stop being a bitch. And then they all laugh at me. I know he’s probably right on how I’m such a sensitive bitch. My only ways to escape from it all is watching tv, going on Reddit, and drawing. I would say talking it out with my cat by my brother is usually in my room and he would just think I’m insane. Whenever I’m around people I decide to just put on a happy face and hide the pain. Whenever something humiliating or something regarding hate for me goes on I just write down negative things on a piece of paper. I don’t know how many times I’ve wanted to kill myself."
1,"I’m losing patience with my mother.. My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”"
1,"My suicidal/depressed GF hates me/pushes me away can meds save her?. Its been a very rough couple of months, especially with this corona forcing us to be together when she 'hates me'.

Quick summary: S.O. of three years has had a history of depression and I think it is very bad right now (seeing a psychiatrist this week, makes constant suicidal thoughts). Our first year was really great but she got pregnant accidentally, it was stressful but we moved in together and started making it work. Ever since she was pregnant, and even after baby our relationship has been on a downward trajectory (sometimes it had highlights).

Specifically some major things are our intimacy fell off a cliff (which has been huge for me, she says I am gross, doesnt find me attractive, 'not a real man' etc), she tears me down a lot, says I am stupid, lazy, NEVER wants to hug/kiss/hold hands, tells me she hates my family (we are living with them right now for free for the last half year, and they really went out of their way to try to make her feel welcome), doesnt like doing anything fun any more, ALWAYS wants to fight etc etc.

I am not perfect at all, and I have gone way out of my way to listen to her, to fix whatever she is angry about and all it does is make her want more and more. We had a huge fight (seems like 1/week honestly) where she saw I was texting my sister and friends asking for relationship advice and had some huge melt down that I 'betrayed her' and she took baby and drove a few hours to her parents and said she is never coming back and I can get baby in a week.

My question is can depression 'change' someone this much? She was once very loving, very caring, someone I ENJOYED being with. These days it feels like I am just care taking someone on the verge of admitted self-destruction. I feel trapped because we have a kid together. I truly want it to work out, but likewise if she really just 'hates me', doesnt want to hold hands, thinks I am so stupid and gross not sure what future there is. I am secretly hoping this isn't the 'real her'. Can you guys give me a little insight? Thanks"
1,"I'm starting to get real fuckin drained from talking to people every day. ... but these are my friends and I feel horrible to keep telling them I can't talk rn/ sorry I'm really tired/ etc as it feels selfish.

Why is this on the depression forum? I have previously gone through several month long depressive periods and in fact just got out of one in February! But now I feel tired all the time, can't get out of bed, can't do basic productive tasks, worst of all I just feel so irritated when I hear a human voice.

I have never found myself self isolating before. Maybe because I have never had this many people close to me. It feels good to have friends. I don't want to just shrug them off.

Advice? Ty for reading."
1,"I was just told that i´m not going to college this year..  

So, how you just read in the tittle yeah.

I´m 18 and i was about to get a job to have money, but when the corona and quarentine started i stopped.

My parents are the ones who choose my college and the ones who are paying for it. (They´re divorced btw)

My big sister college is about: 934 USD

Meanwhile mine is actually 79 USD.

I was just told that they don´t have enough money to pay for it and that they don´t see me ""Ready"" for the life. My mom told me that i never go out and that i don´t work and that i´m always in my PC.

Like. We all have to be in our homes... so... i can´t do anything about it. I´m stressed and i don´t know what to do."
1,"We are all set up for a tragic life. Until a couple of months i was sure that i would become a music artist which has always been my dream. I know that i have talent. And i definenty don’t say that to brag but i know i do. I have played the piano all my life and I’m pretty good at producing music too. I now know that i’ll never be what i always wanted to be. And thats because i will never try. I’ve suffered from a crippling fear of rejection all my live and I’m painfully introverted when it comes to expressing myself. My dad is also very skillful when it comes to music and has an amazing voice, yet he has never done anything with this. I have now realized that this is because he is the same as me.
With that realization i also realized that i’ll never be anything either. I’ll be just like him, just a regular person who will live a regular life and then die and be forgotten. I’ve never told anyone about this because as i said I’m so damn scared of being laughed at or not taken seriously. It feels like everyones fate is already decided through their genes and we can’t do anything about it.

Does anyone else have similar issues or know something that helps?"
1,Stupid rant. I haven't washed my sheets in ages. My duvet has a massive patch of blood on it that I haven't cleaned up from yet another relapse. I haven't brushed my teeth in weeks. I may as well give up. I feel disgusting but I'm too depressed to do anything about it.
1,"I just simply cant win.... its like swiming in the sea trying to go out but just go deeper and further from the coast, and everybody talks you like you were shit because you cant swim and get to the coast, i supouse that one day of this i just will get the strong will on my mind to just end this, but at the moment, i ll continue swiming in this sea."
1,"Well, I'm done. I tried to change, but my body refuses to.. Hello again, this is deleted user StupidDumbFuckhead here. Around a week ago, I made a post on how I wanted to delete my memories and stuff because my life was cringe, and every action I make, I think it's cringe. I'm a gamer, but I restart video games often. I don't like the save files there. Even if I restart, I think it's still cringy, and I want to restart again! Plus, I have OCD hand washing problems. And I am autistic, so some of this may be dramatic. And I think that deleting my memories would be the perfect way to cure this ""mini-depression"" before it gets worse.

While I was a happy ""child"", and now in my teenage years, I'm a bit depressed, it might just get worse. I have a terrible attitude, and I've been trying to ""change"" it since July 2017, but it keeps getting worse. And with this STUPID COVID-19 existing, forcing me to use the confusing program known as ""Microsoft Teams"" instead of just going to my Special Needs class at my High School, I keep missing stuff, since I don't use my iPad that my schoolwork is on every day. And I could change that. But I won't.

And now, my stupid mother decided that I should ""heal my hands"", so she got rid of my soap and water. They may look terrible, but I'm gonna fucking die now. She doesn't know about how big this mistake is. And I could had avoided all of this bullshit this morning! But I didn't. Instead, I was stupid. I woke my mom up instead of using the other soap. I am so fucking useless. Now I have to limit my bathroom uses, because of her. You see, I had pee problems since I was 7. And no matter how many squares of Toilet Paper I use, pee goes on my hands just from WIPING it. My mom thinks I piss myself, when in reality, I don't. Pee just goes on my hands from wiping it. And I can't wash my hands off. So now my hands have to be dirty, and they'll smell like shit as well. All because of my fucking mother. I fucking hate her.

But, if I delete my memories, then I won't have to deal with any of this! Then I won't restart my games, and think it's ""Cringe"" when I first start them, since I won't remember playing them again! Then I won't know everything I touch will smell like shit since I won't be smelling my hands one-thousand fucking times in a few seconds. Then I'll be even more stupid as fuck, so then I can become smarter! Then, my body won't be stupid as well, and maybe it could reconnect to my brain again! AND THEN MAYBE I'LL FINALLY STOP MAKING CRINGY CHOICES, GET RID OF THIS DEPRESSION BEFORE IT STARTS, AND FINALLY BE A FUCKING GENIUS LIKE I WAS MENT TO BE! I HAD ENOUGH OF MY FUCKING LIFE! I NEED WAYS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MY MEMORIES RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

IF YOU TELL ME TO CHANGE, I WILL JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE, SINCE I'M A FUCKING STUPID CUNT WHO NEEDS HER MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE!

I AM FUCKING LOSING MY SANITY AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE!

I JUST WANT MY MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE AND PERISH FOREVER IN AN ABYSS THAT WILL SOON BE ERASED!

I WANNA BE FUCKING MINDLESS!

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-"
1,"I can't bring myself to unsubscribe from wedding subreddits despite my fiancée's death but they are making everything worse.. I was excitedly planning our wedding, that was probably going to be moved back but still going to eventually happened, happily and with great enthusiasm for so long. I was so excited to call her my wife and marry her and just be with her forever, or as long as we could on this Earth. At least a couple of decades... To do this, I would get inspiration from wedding subreddits and share them with her when I saw something she might like. Now that she's passed away, seeing these posts just jab me in my heart. I won't be marrying the love of my life. She's gone. I go to unsubscribe, but then I feel like I'm just giving up on her and what was going to be, and I just can't do it. I miss her so much. My heart is weak and feeble. I feel fragile. I love her. I love her. I love her. I want her back so much. I'd do anything. Is it bad that sometimes I wish I could just join her in death? There's a small chance I'd see her again then..."
1,"What's worse?. Those days where you can't get out of bed, thinking there is no point because you will waste the day anyways. Sleeping 12-15 hours on and off and getting up groggy, feeling no different than if you had not been sleeping. Still feeling tired both physically and mentally?

Or

Those nights where you get 2-4 hours of sleep. You lie down early but all you can think about is if you have already had your highest of highs. Maybe it just doesn't get better than this. You are so damn sleepy but your head will not quit. You have those dark circles and bags under your eyes, and your mind doesn't even stop as if it won't let go of that feeling?"
1,"Anyone else struggling to go out in the sun everyday?. I cant sleep at night, so I wake up really late in the morning. Then I rush around, try to have a shower without zoning out for an hour, do my makeup, get all my work done, so that I can go outside in the garden because I know its good for me. And sometimes, I cant motivate myself to go out in the garden for 5 minutes. I know vitamin D is good for health, but sometimes i feel like it's pointless so sit out in the cold with my negative thoughts. I know I should be soaking up the sun, taking care of myself, but its really hard, can anyone else relate? :/"
1,"Anyone else feel like their true potential can never be realized or appreciated in this world?. There just isn't real or fair opportunity for so many ppl. Why do I need to go on bc my parents thought they were capable of bringing life into this shitty world they also thought was good enough for offspring. I only am ever hated on. Some ppl don't want to see you successful and only want to see you suffer. Why go on for a life that will only get worse and accomplish nothing just to die. I feel like I have nothing left. No motivation whatsoever to be social again. No motivation to be creative again. To others I am worse than a barcode. I wish I could take someone's place, someone who actually wants this chance at life."
1,"Quarantine got me being rebellious when I'm really not. This quarantine thing really got me acting up. I'm a 15 year old girl, and since this corona virus things have been going downhill. I've had major body image issues, used self harm to punish myself if I wasn't a certain weight, and got diagnosed with clinical depression about a year ago. I have asthma, so that's why my mother is really really strict about going outside right now. I get it, but I haven't been outside my backyard for a good month, and ot's really suffocating. I know everyone is going thru this, but my friends being my support system and me not being able to see them has made my mental state decline rapidly and has me cutting again. Also I've never been the rebellious type. Getting drunk a few times  was all I've ever done which could be considered 'rebellious'. But since a week I just wanna go my own way. I snuck out of the house at 3am a couple of times to drink, had my first cigarette and did drugs for the first time. All within a week. I know it's bad and I should stop asap but I just can't if that makes sense. This is the only thing that's keeping me kind of 'sane' rn. This is probably gonna get lost anyway, but hey if you, random stranger, sees this have you got any advice?"
1,"Life's falling apart. I've recently lost my job, I tell people it was because they had run out of work. When really it was because I was a shit worker, not because I refused to do the work. But I've never been a fast learner and have always found the hardest way to do things. Now I'm applying for jobs but can't shake this massive feeling of anxiety that it will turn out the same. Unable to learn and do anything without having someone hold my hand the whole time.

Ive lost my license, and my partner doesn't have one so I was the only way for her to get to work so she could earn money to support us both.

I have bills out my ass. 

No sense of direction and purpose in life, and having no idea what to do genuinely fucking sucks. I honestly do not know what to do, everyone around me knows what they're doing and where they're going. 

I have always felt as if the whole universe is against me,  everything bad that could happen to me always seems to happen at once. It's the most unfair feeling in the world. 

I know I may come across as a sad sac of shit who's too lazy to go out and try new things, but I know I'm not."
1,"Does anybody else look through posts trying to find one that truly conveys your emotions but you can't find any so you feel even more depressed and mentally isolated?. Like now, I'm feeling really depressed, I'm looking through posts to try find anyone that is experiencing/having the same issues, but I can't find any. 



Does anyone else struggle with this?"
1,"Woke up this morning in a pretty major depressive rut.. Most days, if not every, I feel some semblance of my depression. I’m constantly fighting to live, forcing myself to act, to move, to be. The sadness buries itself beneath a layer of confused muddled mush of feelings. And sometime, rarely, I cry. Like after listening to a song or watching something. But on the day to day, my feelings consist of dried out excuses for what could be real. I can’t lie though, I do feel joy. I feel joy more than I am able to cry in fact. But the joy is just in the moments, fairly short lasting, and soon to be covered by the muddle of confusion which is my usual state. Every now and then, maybe two days - to one week a month, maybe twice a month, I don’t keep track, I get worse. I go into deep depressions. Days where I can’t force myself up. Days where my thoughts are haunted by negativity and where those feelings of muddled confusion manifest in self hate, these are the days like today. I always forget they come. And now I’m here, in quarantine. With plenty to do, read, play piano, exercise, do school work, draw, write, watch tv, endless. Time, all I have is time. But the only thing that’s calling my name is my bed. The only thing I ever want to do is sleep. And now that my thoughts have been cursed with these negative ones, thoughts of suicide and worthlessness -thoughts that always pass eventually, I’ve got the best excuse in the world to just fuck off and lay in bed, right?"
1,"I don't know. Have battled depression and addiction for decades, I feel I'm losing now n see no light, I have two beautiful boys that I haven't seen in a month now because of this b's in the world, I feel broken n just want the pain to finally be gone, I want to turn my thoughts off, I've tried therapy multiple times n countless meds, it doesn't matter what it is nothing has ever brought me relief."

1,"Really missing foster dog who got adopted. Hey guys,

I have fostered dogs on and off for years and I’ve never had a tough time passing the dog on to it’s new owner. But for some reason this last dog I had was just special. I’ve been caught in the worst depression I’ve ever had in my life and because of quarantine we were able to spend every second together for three weeks. Every day I’d take him to the park and watch him play for a few hours, we’d play together at home and snuggle in my bed. I was always sneaking him bits of my food. He was just such a good dog and I really wanted to adopt him but I can’t because once I go back to work I won’t have the time for him. He left yesterday and I cried all night just wanting him here so bad. I feel devastated. How can I get over this?

So i was diagnosed with depression not to long ago but i’ve felt I’ve had it for much longer but then my wonderful best friend said “you know maybe we could try this out” and then I felt so happy I came out to my parents too and they were super supportive and then my life just felt easier I still have depression I still have those days but my life just seems a little brighter now

I constantly think I would be better of dead, I’m crying every few days, I have random panic attacks and am just overall sad and have little hope, low motivation, mental break downs sometimes suicidal thoughts. I’ve never felt any of these go away with any type of medication I’ve tried. What is supposed to happen? Am I expecting too much?"
1,"waiting for this to all be over. My life has been such a pathetic failure that I don't even know what tf to do anymore. I'm such a fucking ugly cunt that I don't even want to look at myself in the mirror. No matter what tf I do it just doesn't help at all. I haven't had any friends since I left school and I don't even talk to my old ones anymore because I don't think they would ever care about my shitty problems. I wish this quarantine never ends because I don't want to ever have to show my ugly face to others.

I have like 1 billion different bloody things going on in my mind that it just drives me crazy every single day. My parents don't give a shit about me and I have no one to go to. I just wished I was never born.

Sorry if u read this I just had to get this out of my mind."

I don't feel like doing anything except sleeping it off.
But I don't even know what ""it"" is! 
Everyday trying to get even the simplest and minimal things done is a struggle. 
All the while this never ending big bag of guilt is on my shoulder. Guilt of not doing enough, not being enough. How do you get out of this? How do you not go further down the rabbit hole? 

what do you do?"
1,"It is what it is I guess. My greatest fear as a child was always being lonely. I’ve felt lonely all my life, even tho I had a few good friends throughout the years. Self harmed a bit, did whatever drugs I could get my hands on, and just tried to fit in with the people around me. But for some reason I just was never like them. Now I’m 23 and I’m as alone as I’ve ever been and my childhood fear has been realized. And I think I’m still I’m okay. I’m think I’m stronger than I anticipated. However it’s so weird how the smallest things can send me tailspinning. 

It snowed last night where I am. I made a Facebook post expressing my annoyance, as well did one of my friends. He got 12 likes, I got 2. Such a petty, nonsense reason to ruin my day. But it actually brought me to tears. That’s so damn stupid because I know in my head that it doesn’t matter. It’s just fucking Facebook. It may just be that I’m drunk tho. 

I hate that this seems to happen so often and that I struggle to get a grip sometimes. All I’ve ever wanted is to be happy but it seems the more I focus on that, the more I recognize that I’m not. 

I’m still hopeful I can turn this ship around someday so I’m trying to keep my head up anyway that I can. Hope you guys do the same."
1,"Tried writing something to distract myself. So you think this was one big step. 
No, nothing is. 
In this case, I feel 
the steps under consideration were similar to those taken by tiny baby feet. 
You think one considers taking such a decision because they want it. 
No, it is the society which rather encourages one to do the act. 
It is just a method of relieving oneself of the pain. 
No, it's not a shortcut.
 It is truly one of the most difficult tasks. 
Those who contemplate on performing it seldom do so. 
For there is this terifying fear of failure 
(and the accompanying shame and mockery). No, one should not eye the victim with contempt but with compassion. 
Instead of acting in the typical 'holier than thou' attitude 
try to take a few steps 
in the shoes of the person you were trying so hard to tarnish the reputation of. 
No, Don't you say that it is an act of seeking attention. 
For a change, think of how hard you were on the person. 
No, the reason isn't silly. No reason is.
It is your mentality that is worthy of the said adjective.
No, therapy does not work, 
not until one initiates the charity of benevolence at home
Reward the victim with a new outlook on life.
Yes, wipe out the punctuation mark commonly called the 'period' 
with the eraser of happiness and love."
1,"I'm tired of my life. I'm 24 years old and my life has been a series of failures. I'm not a very social person I've been like this ever since I was a kid, for most of my life I didn't have any friends. Even now I don't think I really have friends just acquaintances. No one ever asks about me, even my family stopped asking when someone contacts me it's usually because they want something from me or need me to do something for them. I'm a collage drop out and been working dead beat jobs that I hate with a passion. I used to be in a relationship that lasted 3 years but the other person dumped me because I was boring and  their friends didn't like me. I've pretty much gave up on dating and taking care of myself. I tried to reconnect with my family but they really don't care about how I feel they only care about what people think of me and not to ruin the family's name so we don't really get along. My conversation with the family are very brief and always end in awkward silence. I've been spending most of time alone in my room and lost interest in everything. My days are a slow blurr cause I don't do much. I used to spend most of my free time playing video games cause they distracted me a bit from how much I hate my life. Things have gotten worse lately and I've been spending all my time outside of work rotting away in my bed. I don't ever remember myself crying but lately I've been crying everyday on the drive back from work and I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and I'm scared and don't know what to do.
I don't have any friends or family to talk to and I'm piss broke and can't afford a tharapist. I tried to look for free help online but it usually leads to a person telling me to pray my thoughts away."
1,"Haven't slept right in a week. As the title says. Just venting here. I have some honestly incredible friends who I can normally talk this through with, but the stars are aligning in all the worst ways and they're all in terrible places, going through much worse shit than me at the moment. Last thing they need to hear is someone else's negativity right now. 

To keep it simple, for the last eight nights, I've been having panic attacks whenever I settle for bed and then nightmares. It's literally come out of nowhere. I'm no stranger to panic attacks, but I usually only get them in social situations, and nightmares haven't really bothered me much before. I haven't been able to sleep any more than three or fours hours each night, and on two nights, I've just given up and spent time on my computer mid-morning. 

I think it's just lots of little anxieties and worries building up, but the suddenness of it's floored me. I honestly don't know what to do. Been in touch with a doc about it via text (my university medical centre) and all I got back was a link to an online resource about improving your sleep hygiene. I guess the quarantine situation means I can't reasonably expect much on that front, which I understand and respect, but it still feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth. Country's facing some nightmarish shit at the moment but having no medical guidance for it doesn't put any smiles on my face.

I'm trying not to fall into a self-pity hole, but I was honestly not doing *too* bad until I woke up today. I was feeling shit all week, but rolling out of bed and socialising at least one friend each day to keep myself distracted. Today, I immediately just felt like a lemming as I opened my eyes, like I want to just go hurl myself off a bridge. I've got friends in a Discord call right now who I could go join, but I feel so groggy and snappy that socialising is starting to feel like a worse and worse idea the more I think about it.

I know it's just my brain being an utter dick to me plus my body crashing hard from the bad sleep, but I feel really stuck in this slump because of that. Any tips or advice you guys have would be appreciated. Thanks for reading, hope you're all holding up okay and staying safe with the world being as crazy as it is right now."
1,"The quarantine is finally getting to me. Been laid off for just under a month now. 

I see on here a lot that a lot of people tend to isolate themselves anyways due to their depression. I have the opposite problem.

I hang out with my family (My parents, grandma, and a couple cousins I'm close with) and my boyfriend. I work 48 hours a week and on my off days I'm usually with my boyfriend, at one of my parent's house or at one of my two cousin's houses.

This quarantine is making me crazy and I'm starting to get really depressed. I was still hanging out with my boyfriend and parents since I've been laid off but now that the stay at home order (I live in Michigan) is starting to get more strict I've been trying to be more safe. 

My parents last week told me they don't want me over anymore for a bit (which I understand). My boyfriend was over yesterday and I told him I don't want him over anymore for a bit (I don't really have a for sure time line right now, but probably until the stay at home order is no longer in effect) because he's still working. If he wasn't working I wouldn't mind but he works with other people and I know he's not being as cautious as he should be (Not wearing mask and gloves). 

I live alone and don't really have any hobbies. All I've been doing when I'm not with my parents is watching TV, reading, going for walks, and playing around on my phone. All of that stuff was getting boring anyways but I at least was able to break it up a bit by seeing my parents and having my boyfriend over. Now I can't do that so I'm just gonna be doing the same few boring things every day. I live alone too so I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I had the talk with my boyfriend Sunday and decided to have him stay over one more night (yesterday) and then no more for awhile. All I've done the last couple days is cry. All I think about is being alone the next few weeks. I feel like I'm not gonna make it. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for on this post. Just people to talk to, maybe support. Advice on things to do would probably be helpful too."
1,Cry for the millionth time. Battling this sickness took everything. I don't remember but I think it's been that many that I've cried alone. No one listened. No one cared. I don't deserve this life. Even more so since I will be spending it all alone. I wish I was never born.
1,"I need help to stop cutting. I (15f) really need help. It's something I've been doing more and more over the past month or so, and I really need help to stop. Whenever I do it, I almost immediately reach out to my girlfriend (16f) and feel absolutely horrible, but it's what I deserve, so I keep doing it. I'd keep doing it, but she blames herself, and I can't let her do that. I'm hurting her, and she's the only thing keeping me going. I need to stop for her, because she has a history of self harm, has over 10 suicide attempts, and I'm afraid she'll fall back into that if I can't stop. 

Please help me. I can't keep hurting her like this"
1,"Tiredness and Depressive thoughts. Hey everyone,  does anyone find that their mod is massively dictated by their energy levels? Like if you get bad sleep you have much stronger depressive thoughts?"
1,"I cried and I do not think I deserved to do it. My father is emotionless and I inherited this from him. I always had problems with showing emotions especially sorrow. I can't cry. I cried during movie like twice in my entire life and one while playing videogame. I am feeling depressed often but I never talked about it because I always thought that I do not have right to be sad. I met some bad people when I was young and also my family kept me isolated so I developed social anxiety even tho I am extrovert. 

Last year I started trusting people again and made a lot of new friends, had a few short relationships and finally became who I naturally was. I wasn't depressed too often and I found people I can talk to about my feelings. I felt happy. Really happy after all those years.

But my government decided to put whole country in quarantine and closed schools, shops, everything. We are not allowed to go outside. I was supposed to see therapist for the first time, but government banned it before I could go.

It has been more than month in isolation.  My old anxiety came back and everyday I feel more and more depressed. Today I had mental breakdown. I feel like shit since I woke up and can't go outside or talk to anyone because I feel so ashamed of myself. I have a good family, lots of friends, nice home, good school, no one died and this quarantine is not forever. I don't think I deserve to be depressed, there's nothing too bad happening to me. Today I cried. I cried a lot and that's weird because I even thought that crying is impossible for me. I hyperventilated, vomited, almost passed out and cried more. 

Still feel ashamed. Still think I shouldn't cry and feel bad because still think I don't have the right to do it."
1,Are anitdepressants that much of a game changer?. I'm 16 and my parents absolutely refuse to let me get on any kind of medication even though my therapists advises it. i struggle immensely rn especially with suicidal thoughts and lack of motivation. does it really help that much? i just. idk i was my only hope n now that ny parents said no ive been thinking if it was even realistic to set those expectations for it. I know that i'll still need therapy but therapy alone is kinda impossible rn when i have to take care of that myself n make sure i dont miss appointments and all that but can't do that while in such a major depressive episode.

1,"Dont say this. So got told this by my grandfather ""I'm going to live longer then you"""
1,"A bright personality and a sad soul stuck in the same body is torture sometimes.. I often been told that I have a good heart or that I am a good person but I often feel like it isn't true. Yea I do alot of things to help people but I often feel like I am alone in the world. I been told why not get myself someone, I would often reply saying that I am not worth someone having. I been told to get over past traumas, I would reply that I try too but somethings never changes.

Moral of the story is, I have what I need to be happy, yet I just feel utterally and totally useless and void of happiness.

I became addicted to escapism to the point where the very concept of video games are being burnt out for me. Art is starting to not be fun for me, making music is starting to not be fun for me. Everything that I used to do for fun is being burnt out.

Then there is the question of ""why not look for someone"". Simple answer, I am too mentally unstable for a relationship. It would take the worlds most patience person to understand and help me work through my problems without it affecting them. Plus I am terrible with people. 

When I was asked by I joined a league discord and joined a team and stuff, all I could say was. Because I was lonely. Not having people who wants to talk to you, or actually gives a shit about me for so long causes me to just be lonely.

The only thing in the world I want or per-say NEED in my life, are people who gives a shit and understands me as a person."
1,"Potential suicide note/art. It's one of those days I feel like my existence is just a burden to other people. As a distraction, I did this thing.. it's ugly and not the usual art I do, but it has so much of my emotions that I poured into it. It contains all the thoughts and phrases I always think abt or say when I feel like I'm at a low point. But it didn't seem to help me :( while I was doing it, I just felt like harming myself all the more right after I finish my art. So I realized this could be a potential suicide note.. I'm really trying to stay strong at the moment though. 

So yeah I just wanna share what I did.. I hope it somehow helps those who feel the same way as I do that theyre not alone. Here's the link of what I did! please dont judge too hard hahaha

1,"i'm afraid of never getting out of here and few more problems. i'm 24, from poor country and poor family with alcoholic father. i currently share a room with my mom and sister. and theres no way out of that situation except for my fathers death, but even then i wont be able to move out and live on my own... not in this country with broken economy. and not with my education that ends on high school, because i was too depressed to do anything in school and i cant go to university to actually get any degree that couls guarantee me good job. i cant even pay any course... and i dont want to work like i currently am either.

it all drives me crazy. i would probably commit if it werent for the fact that i dont even care about dying anymore. i just dont know what to do, im lost and theres no one to help or support me or direct me in a proper way. i dont want to leave mom with that bastard either. chances of getting rid of him are 0, especially during pandemic. its just pathetic hoping that shit will get better, except it never did. not for as long as i live. 

all i want in life is to be able to afford living in bigger home and all my stupid whims like takeout or fencing lessons. i want to travel a lot too. and i wanted to study archeology - something that probably would grant me job with shit pay but i always wanted to do that. and because im poor, because i cant afford anything, because of my pathetic life situation thats just the worst combination of unlucky events i cant do either and i know deep inside that i will always be stuck like this, in this ugly town and with no friends or even boyfriend (bc lol i never had either, not even one friend irl, no one even had a crush on me. hell, i couldnt go to school trips bc we couldnt afford them). i just... dont know anything anymore"
1,"Something is going to happen.. I think I’m depressed. 

A man I have deep feelings for and can grow to love doesn’t love me. I heard he loved his girlfriend who I believe in return has been stringing him along only in the end to laugh in his face or turn him away, and not just because I’m involved.  

I don’t have contact with him now but I will later. 

I feel as if while I’m depressed, I can feel he’ll fall into depression and something is going to happen to him. 1 of 3 things. I have a feeling I’m going to witness his death or otherwise. I’ll be telling his parents as they’ll learn we won’t be around one another and cannot be around one another like this."
1,"Is anyone else getting more depressed because of the lockdowns?. I don't know how to explain it except for the fact that I love being outside. And now that I am constantly indoors with nothing to do but school work and review cold cases and all that, I feel trapped and depressed. Things I haven't wanted to think about are constantly at the forefront of my mind and I can't get them to leave me alone. I can't sleep. I can barely eat. I feel alone in my group home and I feel like I can't get out. I just want to be outside, and being inside 24/7 is honestly making my depression worse. Has anyone been feeling the same and does anyone have any advice?"
1,"I've wanted to die every single day since the 7th grade. I'm 24.. Even the real fun days, the feeling always comes back. No one loves me, they say it but its an act. Everyone wakes up in the morning and puts on an act. I can't. I feel I don't have emotions because I don't know how to react to things anymore. (jokes, funerals, birth, parties, hanging  with friends) I have to think about how to react, its not natural. I hate my face. I hate my voice. I hate that when your nice its considered weak. I hate how the world works. I hate the racism, I hate the ignorance. I hate when your closest friends do and say the most hateful things about you behind your back.. or when they think you're not looking. I hate how evil this world is. People are so grimey and so greedy. The bad outweighs the good. It's backwards. My grandma died this year and i'm completely empty and don't know what to do. I don't want to be here anymore."
1,Why is it harder for me to be happy compared to everyone else?. I've been diagnosed with depression for 3 years and I have only now thought of this. I really just don't understand why i can't as happy as the other kids.
1,"I miss my razor blade..... i created a throwaway account for this specific topic but i can feel myself spiralling and usually i used my razor as a distraction or something to numb the pain. i know i sound crazy but the same way drug addicts take drugs is the same way i inflict pain on myself. no one ever question addicts, and they all know what they do is dangerous. i treat my razor blade the same way, i know it’s bad and i know it can kill me but i just don’t care. i stopped close to a year ago but i’ve been going through some really shitty things and i feel like i need it again"

1,"Today I lost my fight against self harming again. I lost control over myself and once again picked up the hammer and unleashed all my anger. My anger towards myself. I sat down and let it all out on my leg. Now I'm unable to get up again, unable to put any weight on my leg. Will this ever stop

Due to corona I'm currently on a break from therapy for depression, anxiety and BPD. I live alone, am alone at home 24/7 not doing anything all day. On Friday I made my only friend escape from our friendship. Since then no contact. I hit rock bottom and can't escape. The last days I spent crying and grieving for this friend. Hoping they would return. I kept reading posts that support my point of view, the Borderliner point of view. My emotions were mainly sadness, emptiness, yearning, grieving, hopelessness etc. Today random posts of other people showing the other point of view, my friends point of view, popped up. I lost myself in them. I read through all of them. ""I cut off a toxic friend and never felt more alive"" and similar posts. It triggered my anger. My anger and hate towards myself, until i lost it. I released it. Now the anger is gone and I'm back to everything I felt before."
1,"Being ugly is the worst curse. I believe ugly people (including me) should have a choice to end their lives at no cost or punishment. Also, it would be beneficial to scan babies whilst in the womb, and terminate any that risk being ugly, for their own sake. This is why I have no qualms with designer babies, as there is no risk of genetic weakness or disease. This way, we can eradicate ugliness and there will be less needless suffering in the world, all because of luck."
1,"When is suicide ok?. Throughout my struggles with depression I have had issue with the mentality that suicide is never the solution.  I would like to take this chance to voice my opion so I can hear what others think.

By saying suicide is never the solution is to imply that there is no amount of human suffering beyond which continued suffering is less humane than death.  I believe that such a point does exist and once past it suicide should not be discouraged.  Of course while you are suffering it is easy to think you are past that point when you are not so that determination can be quite difficult.  However difficulty of determination does not mean that point doesn't exist.

Anyway, I curious to hear what others think."
1,"many years of youtube. hey. I have been watching youtube a whole lot  
It´s not the only thing I do, but I cannot motivate myself to do anything different while alone, I watch like 15 hours of youtube in a casual day. I´m 20 now ,and have been watching in similar manner since I was ten. I remember my older brother telling me to go and do something else, I did, simetimes, but I have allways returned to youtube as my source of ""fun"". I never talk to anyone, nobody wants to talk to me, nobody really knows how I spend my days, I feel like people dont like me, due to my life on youtube Im pretty akward as i have not expirienced many conversations in my latest life. Saying that, I dont have many friends in my home town, and even whan i meet with some people i find a lack of things to tell them. Are the people my friend when they never seem to want to talk to me? I don´t really know how to meet people, accept trough alcohol and drugs. I also can tell that my personality changes while talking to other people.  
how can I be?"
1,"Insulin. Hey, how much is the lethat dose of insulin? My blood sugar is between 300 to 400"
1,"just want someone anyone to understand. no one gets it, the pain, the crying, the dark thoughts. it gets too much for me. everyone thinks ""you are lazy"" or ""you aren't trying hard enough"". just because I don't have physical symptoms of being ill doesn't make it any less harder."
1,"i shouldn't love you but i couldn't help it. this applies to me a lot, even if i don't realise it, i get attached easily attached to things, people, and ones that don't love me back. in a way i think i even love my depression too because what am i without it? an empty hole of nothingness i guess"
1,"Plan A - Let's go out spreading good. I've been hanging around this r/ for quite awhile. 

Today is a turning point, where I've lost the majority of my hope. It is now time to plan my next steps seriously. I pos this on the off chance my plan can provide someone guidance on the next steps of their life. And perhaps as an immutable record on the www. Maybe I am crying out to the world? Who knows?

I've been fighting to repair things with my wife for months after another traumatic event, the passing of my mum. In a short span I've lost my wife, my mum, my home, my future, my dreams and soon my childhood home as my dad sells the place.

I've done things wrong by my wife and was too ignorant and self absorbed to realise the signs. Even when she clearly pointed it out to me. I recognise its my fault now; I was too focused on what I thought she wanted and not what she told me she needed, and too lazy and dumb to carefully ponder her words. The best I can do now is to ensure that when I leave she is well cared for financially and that I've done all the things I've said I would to make her home perfect.

After this I will give away the majority of my things; there is no meaning to collecting things without having a home to store them or someone to share them with. Years of work and money wasted hoarding things for a future that will never see the light of day. Alas, fate and hindsight be a fickle beast.

Finally I will leave and volunteer in an impoverished nation to give someone a chance as happiness as penance for destroying my wife's happiness. Maybe I will die here from crime or illness. But at least I will have made a positive impact on someone. Who knows I might feel like I deserve happiness again.

What I will not do is leave without giving back to the world and balancing the scales. There is too much sadness in the world as it is. I have no hope for heaven but maybe this will absolve some of my sins.

I know this is selfish to my family, but my sis has her partner and my dad will have my sister. Sometimes we have to do what will bring us peace be it momentary or eternal.

I hope someone else find solace in the below excerpt of Dylan Thomas's famous poetry. The complete poetry isn't relevant to me but certain sections call out to my situation. It has given me and continues to give me strength in times of weakness, fighting for the courage to do good and remain hopeful as oppose to acting on my sucidal ideation.

""Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."""
1,"I think I’m getting suicidal again, maybe I just need some sleep. I turned on the stove after leaving some chemicals on it and the bottle next to it, just hoping it’d blow up or burn my face off. I don’t know. It was idiotic but the impulse just happened. I think if I go up the stairs to sleep I might look back and try to throw myself down the stairs. At least I put all the knives away. I’m tired"
1,"Detox. So I am detoxing off of Pristiq with the help of my doctor. 
I was on 100mg, then 75mg, then 50mg, then 25mg, then 25mg every other day. Now on day four of nothing and it is Hell. 
Feeling everything. Was sitting in my lab at work yesterday, fighting back tears. I am not a crier. 
Cried last night for a good half hour. 

I know it is my brain chemistry readapting...but how long  it take?

I am quitting them to see how I will feel without them and to be honest, I hate being on something that makes me dizzy if I miss a dose. 

Anyone else come off Pristiq after a long time on it?"
1,"It’s never enough. “You didn’t do this right” “you need to do more” “your being lazy” “you didn’t do this” 

Is it never enough?
I’m done. I’m done with it all and I’m trying to keep it together, I’m really am. There’s always more I didn’t do, or should do. It’s never enough. Just know I’m not holding on for you. I want out. Out of this hellhole. If I didn’t have a best friend to disappoint, then I’d be gone. I want to be enough, but you always see more."
1,"Everything was going great and then it went downward spiral. I don't know what to do and it's too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he's moving and we might not see each other again. 

&#x200B;

Background of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he's been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can't really think of anything else right now, I'm too sad about it).

&#x200B;

I don't know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I don't know what else.."
1,"I don't know where i am. I know where i am but i dont. Nothing feels real and it scares me. I am so scared. I know what happened but what if i don't deserve this? I don't deserve this this is too much i don't want to go back. This is too good for someone like me. I belong in the bad place. I belong there. Burning forever endless torture. I don't deserve this i don't deserve this oh god. There are people starving in other countries i don't deserve this please. I just want to be able to cry again. Nothing ever comes out.
I don't deserve to cry. How can i cry if there are people being tortured alive. How can i rest at t night if so many are suffering. Please let me sleep let me get away from this
I need to get out i need to get out oh god please
Let me out of this endless loop of abuse. I won't be like them"
1,"I just wanna kill myself and quarantine makes my situation worse. Hello, I have already tried a lot to find help but either people don't understand me or he doesn't seem to care.  I isolate myself because I feel like a burden.  No one really likes me because if I don't talk to them, they won't talk to me.  But sometimes I feel lonely but really and I start to have paranoid delusions in these situations.  I have never seen a psychologist.  I am a lost cause and no one is concerned about my mental health or how I am going.As soon as I seek help I feel worse.  Like I want to live like this all my life.  When I'm in the mood I feel bad because I didn't get used to it.  My friends must have hurt with this.  There are those who keep telling me that I have several personalities (I don'tthink so), but then on this kind of thing I think about it all night.  Or some people tell me that I am too skinny.  I don't understand why people care so much about people's bodies but not about their problems.  I'm fed up. So I would like to leave to stop living in all this suffering, so that people can notice that I existed."
1,"My depression got back, welcome back i guess??. I've been taking birth control pills and it screwed me so bad, i cut myself, i think of death and several ways to do it on daily basis, i can't stop taking the birth control pills, i take them not to sleep with someone, I'm sick and the doc told me to take them, it's so tiring, i don't wanna shower, or look nice or anything, all i want is peace of mind, and i don't remember the last time i had that, i miss enjoying stuff, i wanna read a book but i just can't because all the thoughts comes and i start thinking of how worthless i am, I'm in great pain, and i don't have anyone i could rely on, i don't trust people, i have casual friends but i can't tell them anything...
It's really hard to be alive."
1,"Not coping well in quarantine & virtual dating/rejection. My (23f) job went remote 6 weeks ago. It was the only social contact I had. My coworkers and I weren't friends, but I was around people and didn't just stare at the wall all day. I miss hearing other people's voices so much. 

I live with my parents and we have a terrible relationship that makes me extremely lonely. My mom has slight agoraphobia so I was forced to stay inside my entire childhood. I'm getting triggered and am intensely lonely.

I've always used tinder but now have been using it obsessively. I'm not attractive but am photogenic. I got out of an abusive relationship this past year which has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I'm extremely self-conscious. 

I started talking to this one guy for a while through text/phone calls. He asked to videochat and I said ""I feel like you're not going to like me once you see me out of pictures."" (I had been snapchatting him and he definitely got pictures of my body. So he was aware of what my body looked like). But I'm carrying a lot of face weight that isn't shown in selfies and I have some acne and indents (which he knew about too). 

He assured me it wouldn't be an issue and he wanted to make me feel good about myself. He said we were a great fit emotionally and sexually (sexting). He found me attractive. So I agreed.

We videochatted and it went well. I enjoyed it and actually liked him more. Well, low and behold, he's instantly not into me anymore. I asked why and he wouldn't give me a reason even when I pressed. So naturally, we know what it is.

That gutted me. 

He was SO into me before. And then it instantly switched off for him.

Now my brain is going a million miles a minute. It's telling me that my abusive relationship was the best one I'll ever have. Which I've always believed. I mean honestly, that man is the only one who loved me for me. He cared about me more than my parents. He was my only friend for the last three years. I called him and asked to get back together. He said no.

I know I need to lose so much weight and get botox and make major improvements to my physical appearance in order to have anyone even consider liking me. But I also know that's not possible. I'm never going to lose this weight and I just don't have the money.

So now my brain is telling me I have to get used to the fact that I'll never have a boyfriend again, which means no husband/kids. I've never been successful with making friends. I'm trying to accept the fact that I will always be completely alone. And I just wish I could. I've been crying nonstop since Sunday. 

And I'm expected to work through all of this. I'm expected to be more productive than usual in order to keep my job. I literally can't even keep myself alive.

Sorry for the rant. I'm just so fucking lonely."
1,"I need to stop nostalgia.. Any tips? I’ve realized and accepted that nostalgia is killing me. Killing my dreams, moments, and I always am trying to recreate the past in many ways. It’s unhealthy and as much as I feel comfortable in what I know, it’s not helping me get anywhere not helping me with my depression. Any tips on how to overcome this?"
1,"How can you focus on reading when you are distracted?. I do not know if I suffer from depression now, but I have previously been diagnosed, and I find it very difficult to just sit down and read a book. It's partly because of the silence: I don't want to feel alone and with my own thoughts and so I prefer to sit on my laptop with videos of others or with music. I'd like to get through some books I've been meaning to read for a long time now that I have a little bit of extra time, but I just can't make myself focus. I can't get beyond a couple of pages before getting up and doing something else.

1,"I don’t want to be awake..

1,"Anyone else get extremely depressed that you struggle to move your limbs?. So personally, sometimes when i'm depressed as shit. My limbs feel very heavy and i struggle to move them, i'm guessing this is a mental thing that affects energy but anyway, hope you all can have a ok day/night and thanks for reading whatever this is."
1,"How do you keep away from “bad” thoughts?. TLDR: prolonged suicidal thoughts on my “bad” days, how do I stop from thinking about it too much?

To provide some background, I (34F) was sexually abused by my parents since I was 10 (continued until I was around 26, when I cut them off) and I was bullied during elementary school. Everyone always told me I’m too pessimistic, too negative, and cry too much. I suspected I had depression but never had psychiatric exams. Even when I was in elementary school, I had some thoughts like “I won’t have to be worried/scared/sad anymore if I die.” 

I went NC with my parents about 8 years ago, which is when I first met my husband (my then first boyfriend). My husband made me realize that my parents are toxic.  It’s interesting how I thought my parents were loving, good, “model” parents back then. The crazy thing is I still miss them sometimes.

Things got better after a while, I have a decent job that pays well and just bought a house this year. Despite all these “positives”, I still fantasize about sleeping forever or not exiting in this world. This especially happens when I have arguments with my husband. I guess you could say the only positive existence in my life is my husband (and my dog).

Whenever I “fight” with my husband, even though they are all small arguments, I feel like the world is not worth living and I constantly find myself looking up ways to end my life. I spend hours (usually for 3-8 hours at a time) reading about various methods of suicide that have/haven’t been successful. It came close the other day, when I was testing a belt on a wall hook to see if I could hang there for at least 10 mins without falling. But then I remembered reading about how hung corpses are gruesome and it’ll traumatize whoever finds the corpse, and I didn’t want my husband/dog going through that. 

I went to various therapists and psychiatrist before and they haven’t been that helpful. I’m tired of talking about my past at this point. I’m tired of crying. Husband still wants me to give it another try, possibly get on depression meds. Last time I took Zoloft, it didn’t seem to really help, but I can’t tell for sure since the doctor prescribed me a “pediatric” dose (I’m small).

How do I stop dwelling on suicidal thoughts? The world doesn’t seem that great and if it wasn’t for my husband, I’d probably just die. 

Sorry for the disorganized story and format, I didn’t sleep last night and I’m typing on a phone. Thanks for anyone who bothered reading this."
1,"Covid-19 Pandemic anxieties. Hello, 

I have never really been the type to be Depressed, I have always been a very optimistic and confident  guy. As of late with this whole Coronavirus pandemic i have been feeling the loss of interest in participating in society and maybe even being alive. This really spans from me being a classified an essential employee at a t-mobile store. I am thankful to be able to have a job because I know it is much better than not having one and I personally am taking the right precautions to stay safe.

However since my store reopened, most of the types of customers i have been seeing are people breaking quarantine because the are simply bored and want to be out and about. the question we get the most is  ""what kinds of deals do you guys have?"" 

This infuriates me because someone can just as easily look this up online without putting themselves or my co workers and I in danger. and for as long as there are people like that i dont see the situation getting any better.

I have also seen the better air quality and have read articles here and there about the atmosphere actually healing from the reduction of human activity.

Maybe humans are parasites despite our perceptions of ourselves. We are the only species that take and never give. we are literal maggots to this rotting earth. the more turmoil we go though, the less will i have to live. i feel like there is no point to anything at all. and i have never felt as suicidal as i do in these times"
1,"i want to end it all so badly. im so tired. i sincerely hope theres no afterlife. i just want dreamless sleep. eternal oblivion or whatever.

everyone tells me not to... but they dont know. they dont know how exhausting it is to wake up like this. they have fun, they go on dates, they enjoy life without this curse.

what would they even do if i did? they couldn't do anything. because id just be dead. ugh

but i wont. because i know it would hurt them a lot worse than it would hurt me. and in the end this isnt a pain i wish on any one of my friends. i love them, so ill stay alive for now. even if it sucks and i just want to scream at the sky and just not e x i. s t anymore. 

ill stay alive so they don't have to scream at the sky like i do. ill stay alive so they dont have to rant about how much they want to die on r/depression like i do. 

and they won't thank me for it. and they'll never know im only staying alive for them, and thats okay. maybe one day i can thank them for being my reason not to give up, but today is not that day. because today, its 9am, the sun is shimmering, birds are out, and i have never wanted to kill myself more."
1,"Coping/managing between therapy sessions. During and right after a therapy session, I feel connected to my therapist and positive about my CBT exercises for the week.

As the week goes by and my next session approaches, I feel more and more pessimistic about my therapy regime, struggle to do my CBT exercises and feel like I haven't spoken to my therapist in months...

Does anyone else struggle with this or has anyone stopped going to therapy because of it? How do you deal with it?"
1,I just want to disappear. I’ve been suffering with depression ever since I was 9 and eventually developed PTSD from childhood trauma and neglect and mental abuse to the point where I legit do not know how to make any friends what so ever. I am always alone.. I never get asked to go anywhere.. no one thinks of me.. I always spend my birthdays alone.. holidays are depressing.. etc. this pandemic isn’t helping me feel any better but it isn’t like I was even doing anything with my life before this .. I do wish I could just disappear and start a new life somewhere with amazing people who want to be successful artist like me someday.. 😔 but I just know it’ll never happen and I get even more depressed knowing I’ll forever feel this void and emptiness that’ll never be filled.. I really just hate everything 😔 tired of having no home as well. Tired of having to constantly move and I gave up so badly to the point I haven’t even unboxed any of my things for two years now... sigh 😔
1,"I'm struggling. Need advice how to pull myself back up.. I'm really struggling right now and need some help. 

On the outside people think I have it good, because I have a wife, 2 kids, a house and a reasonable low end job, but I go through periods of feeling really down. Like a lot of people due to the virus I've been furloughed since the lock down and don't know if I'll have a job to go back to after the lock down is lifted. It's stressing me out. 

I've been in the house for 3 weeks just me and kids because my wife is a key worker. Now, I love my kids but I am not the stay at home type. I've always been the strict parent with a short fuse and my patience has been worn away to nothing. I find myself shouting at my kids and wife. I hate it. It makes me feel worthless that I can't even be nice to my family.

I grew up with a family that has strict ideas of what a man should do and be so I've never really able to manage my emotions. I just stuffed them down until they burst over. I struggle to talk to people even at the best of times, never at the worst. 

I know this is a bit of a ramble and I apologise but can anyone suggest anything to help everything stop weighing so much? I need to drag myself up because this can't go on."
1,"The food chain of life. Every time I play ps4 with my mates I’m the one getting bullied. It’s always me. They make fun of me, insult me and then decide to kick me from the party. We are all friends but I always wonder why it’s me who is always the butt of everyone’s jokes. Yeah, sometimes they are funny but it gets to the point where I consider leaving them. One of my friends likes to say that I’m at the bottom of the food chain and that’s why I’m always getting teased. How do I get myself out of the bottom and stop getting teased. Why is it people like me that get picked on. Why does nobody help. I don’t understand"
1,"I think my brain is rotting.. I’m not sure how to explain this well but I’ll try as best as I can. 
All my life, I’ve experienced this feeling of confusion, dumbness and brain fog. Since I was a kid, I’ve experienced major anxiety and depression and I wonder if this has a lot to do with it? Ive always had a HUGE problem not being able to learn anything at school. Being in an environment with so many others allowed my anxiety to almost completely numb my brain out.  
My anxiety and stress got so bad in middle school that I developed psychosis (possible schizophrenia) for 3 years and I never told anyone about it. It really physically felt like my brain was changing form or melting.
In college, it was all the same. I’m 21 now, and It’s as if my confusion and IQ worsened so much. I couldn’t learn anything, including basic knowledge. When people would talk to me I couldn’t process it-I can’t even say a proper sentence correctly without pausing as I speak and having to try my hardest to word it correctly. I made so many unbelievably stupid mistakes, I became so forgetful and my movements slowed. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be successful at school or learn how to drive a car. There’s no motivation for me to make a plan for my future or maintain my hygiene. I don’t know what to do. I am really convinced that my brain may be rotting. My brain always becomes confused and then starts to ache really bad like it’s shutting down. I feel like dying because I don’t think I can ever be cured from something like this. It’s actually like my mind is dying and disintegrating as I’m still alive. Am I even making sense? I’ve never been vocal about this-I’ll accept any insight and advice on this, please."

1,"Tips for helping my depressed friend?? i want to support but i'm not sure if i know how to :(. My (23f) closest friend (21f) has revealed to me that she is depressed, does not have the energy to eat & feels the weight of the world on her shoulders. She really does have a lot on her plate, a narcissistic creep of a dad, a lazy alcoholic mother that has seemed to have resigned from motherly duties (they have recently seperated & she lives w/ her mother) many animals (birds, horses, dogs) to feed everyday, a younger brother to look after & a boyfriend that does sweet fuck all to help or support her.   
She is not the type to feel helped/supported by advice, so how can i help? is there anything i can say to make her feel better? She isn't very affectionate either.   
The help that i feel comfortable giving her is not the type of help that she would really appreciate & i am worried. i don't know what to do... i want to be more adequate when it comes to dealing with mental health & i love my friend :( i don't know what to do guys, please any advice would be so appreciated."
1,"How do you tell if you enjoy an activity? (or may enjoy it in the future). I have just enough motivation to do a hobby. (s/o to wellbutrin)

Creative things are my default. But when I try different ones, they all feel equally unappealing.

So how do you tell whats worth pursuing?

(It doesn't help that I'm shit at them. I feel embarrassed because everyone I know doing similar things started 5+ years ago, and isn't shit at them. If I try to have a conversation about it, I’m gonna sound like an idiot. Half of my motivation is to have something to talk about so I don't seem so boring. So it feels pretty pointless.

I've been told by therapists to think about what I liked as a kid 'before' I was depressed, but that's obviously a dead end.

I know I like cooking. But there's only so much cooking I can (afford to) do in a day. None of the things I try feel anywhere near as satisfying. But even my interest in that has gone down recently.)"

1,"I don't know what to do with life anymore. So, I'm finally reaching out to someone, other than my 2 friends who aren't very helpful in that respect. Its been going on for around 5\~6 years \[i dont remember what year i was in at that time\], my life is going to shit, i think about >!killing!< myself almost daily. As i already said, i havent really spoken to anyone about this and i felt that now would be a good time to do so. The school doesnt do shit about the bullying, or anything that can lead up to this. i didnt think much of it at first, just thought it was normal sadness. But it didnt go away. It was there, and it still is. I have the odd happy day, but even then its ruined. It feels like im falling, and with every day im hitting something on the way down, climbing again, and then falling further. I want to feel normal again, i want to stop being used for 'therapy', and i just want to be left alone once in a while. I came here so i could get this off my chest, because its starting to overwhelm me. I use humour to cope, but all the people i use this with tell me i'm not funny and that i should stop trying to be. i get put down for bringing up anything im proud of, or anything i feel worried about. im close to ending it, but i dont want to let down anyone who truly does care about me, but at this point there's only around 3 people i know of. I'm pretty much done with life, done with the people in it, and done with myself. Im sick of feeling like this, because its starting to impact my physical health, and i dont have motivation to do anything. I've tried to find something to do with my time, but nothing works. i just want to be a new person, or just disappear."
1,"3 years of heartbreak. Listen ladies and gentleman I need some people to talk to. I’m not going to go into great detail but I have been completely in love with this girl for probably the past 4 years but 3 years seriously. There are so so many intricacies right the story but let’s just say I’ve spent days upon days in time ruminating of being with her of our memories and our future and how I was the Happiest and most driven I’ve ever been with her. I’m a pretty emotional guy I guess but the amount of nights of sleep I’ve lost over this girl is astronomical, I’ve gone for runs at midnight bawling my eyes out just and bawled my eyes out so so many times. 

I’m a good looking guy in very good shape (not bragging) and I like to think I am a very good person but anyways I cannot live anyone and I also don’t know how to put myself out there as I’m not super social to strangers and I put myself into introversion more often than not even though I have good social skills. She is dating my friend and has been for about a year and anyways I have times where I forget she exists but then I see her friend or her name somewhere and I’m put into a heart wrenching “depression” I guess and I don’t know what the fuck to do, all my dreams and goals seem pointless if I can’t share them with her. I can still remember vividly her telling me she didn’t love me like I loved her and processing to throw up in the toilet instantly after no joke. I can’t do this anymore people I can’t"
1,"I’ve just stopped talking to people about it, it’s given me a lot less stress.. I’ve been depressed for most of my life, I used to constantly talk to my friends about my issues. But recently I’ve learned that nobody actually cares, and no advice ever helps. Opening up about it doesn’t make me feel better, it makes me feel stupid. I just feel stupid and weak for being like this, so since it has no point I’ve just stopped talking about it. And on the flip side they stopped asking how I’ve been. I’ve got a few “glad you’ve cheered up a little bit” and “good to see you’re good” and such. I’m not actually better, I haven’t been this bad in a while. Been going through a rough period for a few months now. Ending it’s not an optional, and I hope I can improve my situation after all this virus stuff passes. But it’s just a pointless hope, my life’s not getting any better. I’m still gonna be the same fat loser until I die alone in my 30’s. But hey at least I don’t gotta deal with the constant bullshit from people who don’t actually give a shit about Me. And I don’t have to do the stupid song and dance of being vulnerable and accepting shitty advice from people. Now I can just bottle it all up in silence and not have to deal with others “worrying” about me."
1,"I've Compromised Myself. So I have been talking to this girl (im a guy) from a subreddit for making new friends since february. At first we were just friendly, wed talk about anything and everything. There was a girl i liked at work and since i didnt really have any close female friends at the time there was no one to ask for advice/talk about it with. So i talked about it with this girl. But then this girl got back with her ex, which i kinda saw coming. But especially since quarantine me and this reddit girl have talked a lot. I hypothetically asked her out to which she said yeah. And so i confirmed that if i actually came to hers after quarantine and asked her out she would say yes, and she said yes. So theres that. 

Since then we been talking about everything and more. The last week we've been calling each other and sending each other nudes. Which we would joke about a few weeks back. Like id say 'send nudes' and shed say 'bet', then id say 'jkes' and then 'unless u wanna'. Basically i have fallen for this girl hard we've even been on dates in games. Ive tried to figure out if shes serious, like am i just being played. But everything seems to check out. Like she sent nudes and stuff and we call. But yet i cant help but feel like it could still be a massive troll. Like she knows im not talking to anyone else and stuff as she would say 'i dont have side hoes', she says she doesnt and i 98% believe her. But obviously until we meet there is gonna be doubt. But it could literally be months before we get to meet. Im treading on dangerous water. Because if this is not all it seems to be im gonna have a big fuckin problem so i hope to fuckin god this is real."
1,"I'm still alive. Well, here I am.

  I don't know where to begin. Life has been pretty rough lately, it has been for everyone. I've been working as much as possible so I don't lose my mind with everything that has happened within the past two months. The best conclusion I can currently come up with to make myself feel better is plan for the future. We hope (my household), with our stimulus checks, we can move out of the motel we're currently living in. Since I am also still working and receiving a paycheck, I intend to use this money towards fixing my teeth and getting a phone. I intend to help my best friend get her license and a car in the both of our names. Eventually, we're going to move out of state together. We can't figure out where yet, but that doesn't matter. We're making goals and we're planning and we're working and waiting. That's all we can do, right now.

 On a sadder note, I'm learning to not cry as often. Which doesn't sound sadder, by any means. But I kind of feel like it could be. Numb has always been worse because it just makes the days go faster, it doesn't take away that looming sense of doom in the back of my head. Or take your face away when I close my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I know I'll be okay. I just need to listen to 'I see a light' by Hank Williams on repeat and keep reminding myself what I need to do. If the harsh things I've been through have taught me anything, it's to learn to love and let go. And the best way I know how right now, is to just hope that someday, you'll be proud of me. That also keeps me going a little bit. That's what helps me accept what has happened. Instead of convincing myself I'm horrible and letting myself rot in my own little shell like I have so many times in the past before, once I started to, it woke me up. I saw myself in the mirror last week and I hated what I saw. So, if anything, You'll be proud of me someday, just like I'll be."

Im even lucky i still got my job, hence I have used almost everyday to sneak away isolating in my car to the point where collagues come to ask me if im okay. I guess thats what is my underlying intention. I feel like nobody cares and im all alone. I even self harmed at work several times.
 I feel so deeply ashamed of myself. Someome came to my car again today and I want to just drive off som cliff or something.  I hate myself. I deserve to be in pain. Not even trying to feel better."

1,"Is it my fault?. I have depression because of failed relationship with one girl. Funny, i know, but this shit happens with me.
She is completely lonely person, she doesn't have friends. Other people in our group laughed at her, they see her as selfish, stupid person. I defended her all the time, though she didn't know anything about it. She had a depression, i wanted to help her, cheer her up, and suddenly felt in love. When my attempts to start relationship failed i used tactic proposed by my psychologist - write an letter, where you can write about your feelings and ask for help. I did it. I didn't want relationship with her anymore, but i wanted to talk. But she ignored me. Ignored, ignored and ignored.
A couple of month have passed. This time was terrible for me. I told the story to my friend, and she told me, that maybe you can write her now,  start Just friendly conversation. And she ignored me again. Yeasterday i was so angry because of this, that i write ""i hate you"", because i really hated her because of doing that with me. She ignored.
Yeasterday's evening i stalked her twitter - a horrible misstake.
""that dumbass classmate writes me again. I almost commited suicide this February, and he wrote me fucking essay about how terrible his life is and now he is offened because i didn't cheered him up and didn't wipe away his tears. Go to the doctor, you bumbass, its better than living with illusions about girlfriend""
""im fucking shaking because of this story, i deleded the conversation story. Maybe he'll write a book for me. The most terrible thing is that he knows where i live""
I had depression since 2018, i almost commited suicide in november 2019. I went to the psychologist. I was THE ONLY person, who  treated her like a real human beign. I reallied loved her. My friend, that told me to write her, told, that she was shocked, and she was always that person, which i see now.
I don't know what to think about. I feel like a shit. I am so confused. No one never insulted me like that.
I feel guilty right now. Guilty of writing her, guilty of cheering her up, guilty of sending her that fucking letter, in which I asked for help.  Why?  Why is it so Hard, even knowing what a shit she is. My friends support me of course, but they are my friends. now i want either me or her commit fucking suicide. I want  her to fucking now all the truth about me defending her from our classmates. I want her to remember the evening, when I took her criing home.  I want to spread across the Internet the disgusting  nude photo of hers i found in her twitter, i want her fucking kill herself.
So, what should i do to calm myself? I can' attend psychologist due to that shity virus. Please, tell me"
1,"Anyone feel like they were fixing their mental health then stay-in mandates backtracked any progress?. My depression has been progressively getting worse over the last 2 years to the point where my physical health is severely being affected. I found a therapist that I really got along with and we had started the process of possibly starting me on medication. Then what really felt like overnight I was confined to my house No school No job No therapy. Everything feels like it’s been put on pause and I’m not sure I’m able to survive a pause. I do understand the circumstances of the pandemic far outweigh the discomforts I feel at home what can I do though ? I can still contact my therapist but since it’s done through my university they’ve set up a ‘call in as needed’ system and with my family around the house there isn’t much room for privacy. Medication has to be placed entirely on hold being unable to leave the house and I’m not sure if at the moment that’s an allowable necessity. And routine feels unattainable, I’m too anxious at night to sleep then sleep all day and I can’t tell if I’m consciously avoiding meals or not but either way I eat a lot less. Lack of basic self care isn’t new but a month ago I felt like I was doing the right things to fix that and now I just feel lost."
1,"I promised my bf to pretend that I'm not depressed. I've been with my bf for a year and half. Lately my best friend left me, which made my bf the only person I can rely on and talk about hard feelings coming from depression. The worst part of me is having mental breakdowns regularly - when this happens, I cry with no reason for a long time and need some gentle support.

So yesterday night the breakdown came and I couldn't fall asleep till 5AM. When I told my bf in the morning about my trouble night he got frustrated. He asked me if I ever think about him doing such things - by that he meant not sleeping, crying and feeling depressed. 

He also told me that I'm giving up and do nothing do fight the depression. Yeah, I can't do much at the time - due to pandemics I cannot go to therapy. I also feel so senseless that any fight isn't worth effort for me, to be honest.

So due to his frustration I promised him to pretend that everything is fine. This thing gives me many difficult feelings, like the feeling that I won't longer be able to be my true self to him. Or the feeling that I've lost the only person I could rely on hard times."
1,"Depression is like a heaviness you cannot escape. It is constantly crushing down on you, making simple things like eating or getting up like a twenty-mile uphill hike.. Depression is all consuming, for me I feel it before my first thought when I wake up. Depression is very good at exploiting vulnerabilities and eroding your strengths. It really tires you physically and mentally because all you are doing is putting all your energy towards just trying to be normal. It feels like you are in a world of your own, disconnected from reality, where everything going round you is on mute.

I am always finding ways to escape this constant feeling of sadness, but it always catches up. Sometimes you have the will to fight it, but when everything you try and do fails or makes things worse, I reluctantly start to thing it is best to do nothing. But doing nothing doesn't help either. There is no winning.

It has come to a point where when I see happiness from something as simple as enjoying an ice-cream to joy from affection, I am jealous of it. Jealous and sad because I know I cannot feel that happiness. 

I am full of pain and darkness."
1,"Does anyone else on medication feel a call-of-the-void to stop taking pills and go back to feeling miserable?. Just as context, I've been diagnosed with MDD since I was 14. I didnt start taking treatment seriously until I was 20. This year I turn 22. My psychiatrist explained to me that because I had gone for so long without treatment, my brain has essentially rewired itself to insufficiently process reward chemicals, and that I would need to take medication for potentially multiple years before going back to normal. She said that, perhaps, I never could go back to normal.

Quite frankly, it's been so long that ""normal"" for me feels like being depressed.

It took time for me to experiment around with different medications and dosages until I found the pairing that really helped (Welbutrin 300mg and Zoloft 100mg if you're curious.) When I start taking the medication, I start feeling great after about a month. That terrible feeling in my chest is gone. My suicidal thoughts are suppressed. It feels like I can actually talk to other people.

But every time... after about 3 months or so, I start feeling like I'm not myself anymore. I feel like the medication took apart of me away. Almost like being depressed is a part of who I am. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they told me I'm stupid for feeling that way. Am I actually stupid? Am I alone in this feeling?

It feels cathartic to be depressed and to cry and cut myself. Everytime I start up my medication, i have to resist the urge to stop. Before I'd started taking again, I told my psychiatrist how I felt, and all she said was that I need to fight the urge to stop. She explain that the more times I stop and start the medication, the less effective it will be the next time. And if I keep this cycle up, I may cause irreparable damage to my brain's reward system.

I'm fighting the urge again. I'm starting to miss feeling hopeless and miserable. And in a way, I feel hopeless and miserable not feeling that way anymore.

Sorry my only question really is, if anyone reading this has gone through phases like this? Maybe my friends are right and I'm just stupid."
1,"It's ME. I don't belong here; I don't belong anywhere.

I can't accept the fact that this is ILLNESS. It's ME (but maybe I'm poison, selfish illness making my loved ones suffer.) I relate to people there so much, but.. it feels more like 'people of the same personality, interest, point of view on life and everything, experiences...' I know it's objectively not true, and it's probably healthy to accept the fact it's illness. But any time I read 'depression, the mental illness' it makes me UNCOMFORTABLE (and writing it like this is the same).

I don't know, am I the ONLY one feeling/thinking this way? (That's probably all I want to know.) Anyway thank you for reading. Sorry for wasting your time (if I didn't I'm glad) and hope you have a better day."
1,I want to be depressed. So I am in a weird situation where I don't want to get out of my depression. What if I actually enjoy life and somehow it is cut short. That means I'm actually going to miss it during my final moments. But by being depressed I can die anytime without feeling any regrets or sadness. Does anyone feel this way or is it just me?

1,It frustrating watching everyone around me self medicate.. So I can’t partake in any recreational drug use due to my job and I don’t drink alcohol due to migraines. But literally all my friends and husband are pot heads. It gets really frustrating when I have to sit here and watch them not deal with stress or reality sometimes. Don’t get me wrong I’m grateful that they aren’t depressed or anything and believe me some of them would totally be without it. But there is a jealous/ angry side of me that gets upset. Especially cause it feel even more isolating when you feel like your surrounded by people who aren’t even living in the same reality as you or are neglecting to accept reality cause they are just high for 98% of it. And I’m just stuck in this bubble dealing with all alone completely sober with nothing but my own mind and will power carrying me through.

1,"Every single video of suicide has shown me the same thing. People only care when you do something drastic.. I don't want to die. I've had the thought. Planned it over. A suicide murder. I've planned the blood splatters. The looks on people's faces. Is cutting or threatening my life the only way SOMEONE will take me seriously?! Is being a mental TEENAGER so unbelievable due to hormones that I should have to THREATEN MY LIFE for people to TAKE ME SERIOUSLY. I've heard the same thing over and over. It's normal. A lot of people do that. You don't have that. The only way therapy is paid by insurance is if a doctor recommends it. If I told a doctor everything I'd be sent to a mental hospital. But because I'm emotionally dependent, I surrounded my self around a person who's also emotionally dependent on me. So if I leave she'd probably die. And everyone keeps BUGGING me about school. I know I have work. I get panic attacks when I think about it let alone try and do it. I can't THINK about algebra when I'm having a panic attack.

I've been told I don't need medication by a school assigned councler. Maybe I don't because I'm already going numb emotionally. Maybe when I'm finally 18 I'll get help. What if I'm unhelpable by then. What do I have to do for people to take me seriously. Do I have to threaten my life just to have a professional that I can talk to. One that one immediately judge me, or say it's normal. One that will know what to ask and how to handle serten things. Is that to much to ask?! Because for some reason the smallest amount of money can't be spared for online therapy but $50+ dollars on door dash McDonald's is fine.

I'm so done. I'm. Done with people giving me the same thing over and over. And I'm done with seeing other posts that are simple 'i don't like my meds any more.' And they get HUNDREDS of likes and over 50 replies. What do I get?! 7 likes, 5 dislikes and 2 comments, one of them my own. No matter where I go the adults with NOTHING to complain about get more attention then me. NO ONE CARES THAT YOUR TIRED OF YOUR MEDS AND THERAPY AT LEAST PEOPLE CARE ENOUGH TO TRY AND HELP."
1,"I've started cutting myself again. I'm 21 (f). The last time I cut myself was January 2019 after my ex called me, crying and begging me to stop when I told him I did it again. I promised I would stop. I was admitted to a clinic after I tried to drown myself directly after that. Things were fine. My ex and I eventually broke up after everything we battled through. It's been 6 months since then. I feel like my life is going downhill. People feel like shit around me. I have zero motivation to do anything. I'm constantly angry and moody. My parents make me feel like I'm never enough. Like I don't contribute anything. And they're probably right. I just can't cope anymore. This lockdown is making everything so much worse. I just feel worthless and I hate myself. I've tried everything. Writing. Drawing. Cleaning. Cooking. Habit tracking. Nothing is helping."
1,"Am i depressed?. Okay, so i just want someone answer me am i depressed?

I hate saying, that everytime i am sad that means i am depressed. I never went to a psychiatrist, so i cannot say that i am depressed, because i was never diagnosed. But the feeling, tham i am ,keeps bothering me. I dont want to be diagnosed that i am depressed, but i just want some answers, just to know how to deal with it and how to accept what i am feeling, i just dont know.

Okay so whats my mood. Firstly i have never been truly happy, well the world is amazing and all, but nothing really made me happy ever. I dont say that i dont get happy, but just never that much happy, that i would say i was trully happy, maybe its normal i dont know. Sometimes there are days, like this day, when i just want to die, i really would love to kill myself. I made plans on how i would kill myself, a couple of plans, because when i go to bed, i start to think of a plan on how to kill myself, its just a thing my brain does most of the times i go to bed. I dont think that killing myself would be a bad thing, i feel such a weak person and also dont want to live, so why not leave this life and let others live it, who want to live, i just feel that i just take up space for people who want to live, for people who are trully happy. I just feel really weak and a coward on not just doing it. I thought about it for the last 13 years of my life, so maybe the time has come and i just need to do it, i just need to have some balls and just freaking kill myself. I just dont see the point of living if i dont want to, there are people who wants to live and dreams big and are happy, so i just want to give them the space for it. So maybe someone could explain to me am i depressed or maybe someone could be the person who would encourage me on killing myself? I just dont know what to do anymore and maybe i just need to have the guts to end it all."

Depression, suicidal thought (almost daily), strained relationship with my father, the death of my dog (who's saved me from ending it earlier in my life), my ""best friend"" consistently being a dick to me throughout the entire year, etc. etc. etc.

Somehow, in january this year, something snapped in me. I was going to turn 2020 into the best year of my life. I started eating better and exercising more, already lost nearly 17 kg so far, I started practising my social skills more, I made sure I got a promotion at work. But then, it all got turned upside down in a heartbeat.

This Corona pandemic has ruined everything. My biggest hobby, which is going to concerts, has now been taken away from me, paranoia within my family has risen to a point where the toxicity levels are at an all time high and now my grandmother, who is one of the only people I've ever felt close with, is in the hospital. Suffering from Corona with a very slim chance of survival.

The one time in my life where I actually got motivated, started bettering myself and was going to make my way out of depression and anxiety so that in the future, I wouldn't have to go through my entire life alone anymore, I could maybe get in a relationship without messing it up due to anxiety and make some connections with people. The one time I started getting a little better everything turned to shit. Just like it always seems to do. Now I've slid back into a depression that's possibly worse than ever before. It's like I've been destined to be taken down to the ground on every step my entire life. I know there's way bigger problems going on in the world right now, but this is just how I feel right now.

I hope this year is over quick, because I will make it through. I owe it to my dog and my grandma."
1,"i was in denial. i’ve has anxiety and depression my whole life. i’ve heard people say it’s not possible but i have had panic attacks since i was 3 or 4 years old. 
growing up i was very suicidal. i didn’t know what anxiety was and i thought i was broken. i wanted to die more than anything. i was cutting myself at the age of 10. 
i eventually found out what was “wrong” and i’ve been on lexapro for a couple years now. i’ve been doing alright. so i thought. i’ve been proud of myself and i thought i was doing better. 
and now i’m haunted again by urges and thoughts of death. 
the pain is a lot to handle and i’m not sure if i want to do it anymore. thing is i’m almost 24, have an amazing husband who doesn’t deserve this. but i know it would destroy him if i did do it. my mom would probably die. my brother needs me. 
i just don’t want to be needed so i wouldn’t feel bad about leaving. it hurts too much and i’m over it."
1,"Paralyzed by fear, intimidated by love, and in a constant state of melancholia.. Everything I could possibly write sounds stupid right now. I can no longer find the words I want to use to express myself properly because I can no longer think correctly.

Thinking deeply only yields me anxiety and regret because I don’t feel confident with my intelligence. I think about all the mistakes that have made me feel this way, but still I cannot focus on the time still in front of me to change. I’ve been stupid and lazy when I should have worked hard to preserve myself.

People who are able to live free and pursue their passions make me feel immense longing and self pity. I can’t find my creativity and passion anymore. I’m overwhelmed by life and therefor I avoid anything that might crack the glass of every emotion I’ve bottled for years.

When it all comes out will it give me the fire I need to live or will it finally break me? I don’t feel capable of giving into my gut twisting fear of living free. I want to be alive again. When will I be able to put aside all the bullshit, the self pity, the sleepless nights and wasted days? I just want to feel comfortable in my body again, and at home in my mind.

If these words make sense to you and you have your own version of this phenomenon, please tell me about it and what you have done about it if anything."

1,"Wasting time.... I’m scared of getting older, I’m afraid that I’ll never get the chance to truly live. High school is the time for new experiences and excitement, am I missing out on that? Everyday is just so mediocre and repetitive it all feels like a massive waste. What makes my life unique? I’ve done nothing out of the ordinary, I have no special stories to tell. Will that ever come or will I continue to waste my life away? Everyday I dream of doing something anything exciting but then that day going by the same as the last. And time is going faster now than before before I know it I’ll be in my 20s then 30s. It just feels like I’m missing out on something bigger."
1,"Casual.. For me, depression’s become such a passive thing. 

If my mind is a house, then depression is like some gloomy yet almost harmless homeless guy sitting on the front porch smoking a cigarette. He tells me a stoic “Hello” when I wake up, and again at night. Sometimes he’ll bring up memories I have of people I loved that are gone now, but reliving those moments in my head actually make me happy for a moment. I thank him for these and go about my way. 

I could be angry at him but I feel like I moved him in here myself, with my choices."
1,"I'm going to feel like this forever. I thought I was done with depression. After trying to kill myself about a year and a half ago, I've been making changes to myself, going outside more, making friends, focusing on school, and actually admitting to myself I was trans. I thought things were easier for a while, but I think I was just distracting myself. The reality is finally setting in that I'll never be the person I want to be. At my core, I'm just a sad, lonely boy who doesnt deserve anything but to die. Nothing makes me happy anymore and it's been getting worse and worse. I cant get excited for anything anymore and it's getting worse and worse. It's done nothing but make my life worse. My grades have been slipping and my relationship with my friends and partner has just been slipping. I'm not doing anything about it except getting drunk and posting on reddit. I'm always going to be like this and my situation is just going to get worse and worse until my option is to end it all. Suicide is just inevitable. I dont know when it's gonna happen but it will, because no matter how stable I get, it's always going to get worse and I can never escape the pit of depression."

1,"I hate looking on Facebook. (I'm 23) There's constantly people who have graduated college and are doing something with their lives while I'm stuck here being lazy, pathetic, and have no idea what to do with mine. Only thing I was ever good at is typing and rapping but those don't seem to get me anywhere and I'm too stupid to do anything else. I literally forget my own friend's names sometimes, it's pathetic. Going on Facebook just makes me even feeling okay to being depressed. Not to mention, being a disappointment to my parents is probably the worse part. Other parents are proud of their kids. Some of my high school friends are even getting married. It's a terrifying feeling knowing that time will probably keep slipping me by."

1,"these past few nights have been rough. every night it seems that i am fighting with intrusive and suicidal thoughts.

maybe i am selfish. I want the best for me, which is to stop suffering. quickest, easiest way to achieve this death. people talk about life purpose. maybe my purpose is to show people what happens when you dont treat men like humans and partially flay their genitals and torture them sexually as infants. then you tell them theyre crazy for being depressed about having the most sensitive part of their body mutilated. i think its crazy that male human infants are the only mammal on earth whose genitals require immediate surgical correction after birth. i have been screaming for years, nobody seems to listen, nobody seems to care. the reason is because i am a male. i am not allowed to have emotions. i am not allowed to cry. anything that falls outside of strong, and stoic, is not accepted.

well, fuck you too society. i will not miss you. my chest hurts with an anger and a pain that yearns to be stopped through suicide. congrats society, you have created another statistic, adding to the 80% of male executed suicides.

my only questions are,

do i make it look like an accident so those who know me are less hurt?

OR

do i make it very clear that this was intentional and allow my pain to be felt and understood? <--(funny how people dont care to do this until you are gone)"
1,"messy thoughts/the beginning (rant). i have been depressed for the last 4-5 years. it's not a constant depression. sometimes it hits for months. sometimes it hits for days.  i would guess it in my last year of middle school.  i would be senior in high school now but i dropped out. my life isn't the worst nor best. i am grateful to my mom for what she provided me in life and i don't blame her for my depression at least not anymore. but in her eyes she has done nothing but help me. she has told me from the beginning that she has done everything to help me. i don't know maybe in her eyes she has. unfortunately i have never felt that way. now she has helped me find therapists and got me on meds before. she has always made sure the family was okay.  and please note that i do love her.

my depression started when i became more conscious of myself. i hated how i looked. my mom has a habit of making passive aggressive comments. such as ""you're eating a lot lately"" ""looks like you put on some weight"" ""you're too skinny""  ""you should year make up to hide your acne"". i remember she would physically pin me down and pop my pimples, even when i resisted and cried. i don't remember exactly when but at some point a little before high school i decided to change how i dressed and looked. i had short hair since i was in 5th grade but now i cut in shorter. i wore baggier clothes. and i changed my name as well. i hated my name back then. she named me unity because i brought the family together.  it never felt that way when my dad and step dad left. i started smoking a lot of weed. i skipped most of my classes. i finished freshman hear with a GPA of 1.6 i think. i remember taking pain meds to get out of Spanish class. i started self harming that year too. i would even do it in class on occasion if i was feeling really bad. i wore hoodies everyday. i remember my step dad was the first to find out. he grabbed me and pulled up my sleeve. 

that was also the year i first attempted. it was a weak attempt. i took my mom's pain pills she got from knee surgery. i took whatever pills i could find. i was home alone that night. i took them. i felt so sick. i went and passed out in bed. i really hoped not to see tomorrow i tried 2 days before my 14th birthday. i did wake up, around 3 am i threw up a lot. it hurt so much. i didn't have the energy to clean it up. i went back to sleep. 

as i said before i was going through a point in my life where i changed my identity. so i was not wearing dresses or skirts. i had my best friend over. i don't know what we were doing. we were just hanging out in the room. my mom wanted us to wear skirts for some reason. when we refused she yelled at us the slammed the door locking us in. every time my mom raises her voice even to this day i jolt and cower. i hated my mom for how she yelled at my friend. if it was just me there it would have been fine. i'm used to her yelling at me. but why did she have to yell at my friend.  my friend never came over again.  she was my first real friend.  my mom blamed me for it. saying i should've just worn a skirt. 

later on my step dad lost his job. this ended up making my mom decide to move. meaning i would be leaving my best friend. we had moved many many times before but it got a lot hard in high school.  i cried the whole drive. she told us it was for our own good. we needed to be closer to family. it would be a fresh start. she never liked any of my friends anyway. she didn't like any of my choice and i do admit not all were good. 

my new school was nice. i luckily made friends quickly. this was my first indoor school. it was very interesting. the layout was easy understand. i was probably the happiest here. i was still depressed but i was better. i had an art class that i mostly enjoyed the teacher was at times strict. i made her cry because one of my pieces. it was a pretty emotional piece. she hung it up in the library. 

I've gotten pretty off track but it helps me to write. i'm very off topic.  oh well"

1,"I feel like nobody cares. This is my first post to reddit, and honestly I haven't read much on here either before now. I just kind of need to talk.

My relationship with my father has been horrible for most of my life, but recently it's gotten worse to the point that I don't even try to connect with him or talk to him at all if I don't have to. Even that is too much of a bother to him, though; a few days ago I overheard him complaining to my stepmom that I keep talking to him, saying that I'm annoying and am always trying to get his attention and interrupt his games, and telling her how disrespectful it is that I talk while he has headphones on (for the record, all I say is ""Hey, Dad!"").

You know what I dared inconvenience him with?

I was taking the dog for a walk since she hadn't been out all morning, and he had her in his office.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There are days on end where we don't talk at all, and I bother him too much?! It's completely ridiculous. I can't believe I was stupid enough to move back in here, but now I can't leave because the rent went up too much for him to pay on his own when he moved, and my stepmother and brother can't make up the difference, and even if I knew they were okay, I have no money saved up and I barely make enough to even afford to rent a room somewhere.

This is something I've been dealing with all my life, from him, my mom, and my stepmom (although she's genuinely changed and we're on good terms now, as a child she was my worst nightmare). I have trouble making or keeping friendships because I feel like nobody wants me around or really cares. I don't know what to do to fix my life. I have no real friends, I have a job that I don't feel like I'm good at or can succeed in, and I'm in an environment that is horrible for my mental health but that I can't afford to leave. Part of me wants to just walk out, stay in a shelter and figure out the rest from there."

But I AM depressed. I spend my days in isolation reading and playing mindless games on my iPad. I don't feel like being social, so I make excuses to skip my virtual yoga classes.

I'm trying to keep hopes up that one day I will feel good enough, watching the sun rise while drinking coffee, feeling content and calm with worries so little and so managable. yet when I try to imagine tge future I ""want"", I feel blank and empty inside. I hate it so much and it scares me. it scares me because I'm starting to think that if one day I get the future I ""want"", I will feel the same.

My baseline is suicidal.

Caffeine creates a nice dissociative effect for me where I feel highly energized and strangely excited about life.

Alcohol dims any pain Im feeling and I am more laid back and easy.

Phenibut inflates my ego, helps me socialize, gives me energy, and takes me away from my pain.

I still want to kill myself. I am on a constant emotional pendulum, swinging between set on suicide, or thinking ""hey this isnt so bad""

I never asked for this pendulum ride. I am asking to get off. It is no longer fun anymore. A gun is the gatekeeper to my eternal peace."

1,"Am I falling back in?. So it’s been a long while since I’ve had time with my own thoughts, but now obviously I have more time than I know what to do with. Someone could argue _too_ much time. I know it’s cliché, “this too shall pass, it’s normal to feel sad/anxious right now,” but I was really _really_ looking forward to getting my life on track this year. I finally started saving up to move into my own place, finally looking for a career, finally about to actually graduate instead of walking on a stage. 

Instead, now I’m staying at home wondering when I’ll ever be able to see another face again. I’m stuck worrying if my parents are going to be okay not just financially but also health wise. I say I’m going to keep reading, learning how to code, yatta yatta... but it all just bores me now after a few minutes. I sit at home, maybe go for a run if I’m feeling really shitty, but for the most part i skip meals and lose sleep every night (hence my 4am post). I haven’t showered in days.. My mood changes constantly from irritated one minute, to crying in my sheets the next, then suddenly I’m back on my Netflix binge like it never even happened. I’m also quick to have a glass of wine (or 4), or maybe I’ll go to the gas station and buy yet another vape stick flavored just like mint even though the last time I bought one was “definitely the last time,” or maybe I’ll just keep smoking weed and just numb my emotions for another day longer. I can’t seem to shake it anymore. I don’t know why I’m like this. 

I’ve suffered too long from anxiety, I don’t want to fall back into these same patterns. I want to be better but I just can’t help but think of all the shit going wrong. Am I ever going to get my job back? Will my family be okay? My grandmother just got out of the hospital and is back to living by herself how is she doing? Will I ever get my unemployment benefits? Will society go back to normal, even after this is over? Why am I still thinking about my ex who I know is an asshole and dumped me over 6 months ago? Why am I thinking about how the only people I’ve ever been romantically attracted to, always turn out wrong? Maybe I’m not meant to find love. Maybe I’m not meant to live the life I’ve wanted to. Maybe things would be better if it all ended. What’s the point in waking up tomorrow just to do it all over again? I guess my birthday is coming up this week.. but is that even something I can look forward to in a time like this? Sorry for the long post here, I may have rambled a little, I just really wanted to get my thoughts and concerns out there. Because I feel like I’m fucking spiraling."
1,"I have developed this weird kind of afterlife and its pushing me to kill myself. I have suffered from depression for far too long already. I have had so many past experiences that have ruined me. From the constant bullying to the way i was raised. Lately, i have been having this thought that if I kill myself, I would be able to relive certain parts of my life again this time the way I exactly wanted it to be. I also tend to think that if I enter this new afterlife, I would be able to have the powers and looks that I want like being able to eat whatever and not get fat (I suffer from anorexia because i love food so much but am always afraid ill get too fat). I also believe that entering this afterlife would mean I get to have the exact living condition i want (i am actually pretty well off but I dont feel like i have enough). Overall, i believe that if i enter this afterlife, i get to live the present and the future exactly the way I want to and i will finally be happy. I am sick and tired of feeling like everything is not enough. Im tired of feeling like I am not enough. I have been working so hard to reach my dreams of becoming one of the best music producers and mix engineers but theres always gotta be something thats stopping me from reaching my goals like school or not having the best gear. Overall, i just dont feel like im enough and i feel like jumping into this afterlife would make me finally be free of the prison that is our current reality."
1,"Abandonment issues. Been quite depressed for the past 6 month, wouldn't go as far as saying I am doing a depression but I'm definitely not ok. 

I (23F) have lots of friends (which I am grateful for) but I just don't feel close to any of them and I'm always scared they are going to abandon me. I was getting my sh\*t together but Corona time and being stuck at home had put me right back down. I've had many people abandoning me, hence the issues. I sometime find it funny to write them because there's just so much it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me or if I'm just cursed.

\-Back in the days when I was about 15, I got in a fight with my best friend at the time and she turned everyone against me so that I got kicked out of the group (At 15, those friends were my only friends) There were about 17 people in this group and I'm still friend with 3 of them.

\-My ex-boyfriend (worst thing that ever happen to me) broke up with me but kept telling me he loved me and wanted to come back with me for 2 years after the breakup when we had been dating for 1 year only. Being young, dumb and in love I waited but he was just using me.

\-I moved to another country quite far and the girl that I considered my best friend told me after a bit that I was downgraded to just a friend.

\-My best friend of 2 years told me he had feelings for me and didn't want me around because he was scared he would do something he'd regret, he also had depression but I couldn't help him since he did not want me around. He pretty much broke up with me at that point. 4 month after while on a road trip with 6 friends he snapped and yelled at me telling me the last good memory he had with me was from 1.5 year prior. I had no idea he was resenting me that much until he said so. 

\-My other ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks after my best friend did the same and told me after 1 year of dating that he never loved me and was waiting for feeling to develop but it never did. 

My best friend and my boyfriend both broke up with me within 2 weeks so did not have a lot of people I could talk to.

Add on top of that my family problems because I still live at home with both my parents, my university problems since I can't seem to be able to focus and do enough work, the fact that I can not climb anymore (my passion and stress relief activity) and you get a good idea while I'm feeling this way

My parents are okayish but one doesn't believe mental health exists and the other one thinks I'm depressed because I don't eat meat. 🙃

I need to tell them eventually and it would be much worse to let them know a year after I dropped out or so...

I don’t have any friends I feel a connection with, and even then I just feel like people shove me to the side. This wells up an incredible amount of anger and sadness within me that I simply don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to contain, I don’t even know how to socialize easily, or perhaps it’s the fact that people don’t want to be friends with me because of my looks. The only people I hold dear to me are my parents, who have love and kindness for me, even though I’m currently living with my brother and cousin as well. Maybe I should just disappear"

I try to keep up relationships with a small group of people but even they’re getting tired of me. I reach out and ask people how they’re doing, and nobody ever does the same back. If I stopped messaging people entirely, I wouldn’t get any messages starting a conversation; I start them all. My own family can’t stand to talk to me. I just want somebody who will care about me like I care about everybody else, but it’s never come.

1,"I've forgotten who I am - and I want to remember.. It has been roughly a month or two since I have been sewn tightly with the demon that is depression. Ever since learning about it and becoming diagnosed with it by my local health department, I have progressively debilitating memory, my ability to do basic responsibilities (taking care of the family pets, brushing my teeth) has become hellishly hard, and to my surprise, I have lost myself in this dark, but strangely comforting abyss.

I have been taking Wellbutrin (150mg) for about a month or longer, sometimes missing days and sometimes even with the knowledge that I need to take them by getting out of the bed, forget about it entirely. Initially when getting into antidepressants, my mother noted my eyes were clear, and I was more lively.

But now...I feel as if I have slowly faultered off it's effectiveness. Though it made me periodically happy, it never got me to the point where I wanted to take action in life. Really, nothing changed.

My entire decision on taking Wellbutrin over other depressants was to conserve a source of energy I have plenty of - sexual. Reading on Reddit and especially doing the research, I found that most SSRIs kill libido, which though not very sexually active with others, is a high driving force that I've yet to control.

Sometimes spikes of energy hit me enough to get a little bit done, but at the most inconvenient times (the sudden invigoration to clean out my whole closet at bedtime).

But despite all this, I have become selfish and irrationally jealous and angry at the success of people who seem to have everything together. I know they don't, but they act so well like they do. I dream of the day where I can draw and write of a quality that yawns a jaw wide, dream to feel sexy and wanted, dream to feel love. I have a family that cares about me, but I don't feel that except for my mother. I have several people on my friend's list and yet I feel completely alone. 

I have completely secluded myself from Twitter from artists I enjoy because I am now jealous that the beauty they create completely squanders any characters, worlds, ideas or more that I could ever create. I am weeks behind on class work at my college. I have never felt so powerless. I even - without conscious thought, bought a BB gun to practice overcoming the fear of death. I bought pellets and metal targets to persuade my parents into thinking I wanted to pass the time, but the purpose and practice of me fingergunning my head, into my mouth or under the chin had and still is a constant pastime.

Depression is piloting me into hell, and I just don't know where to start. Journaling feels seldom an idea that works, people say they are there for me to talk to, but I never can get the words out or I feel they would never understand.

Anytime anyone says everything will be alright, I feel myself go semi-ballistic. Anytime anyone asks too many questions that are of the same caliber just differently worded, the same happens. I lash out verbally, often.

I created this account not as a pity party or to be babied. But as a way to get a direct answer and order to follow so that I can push myself to remember who I am, to condition myself to never be jealous or envious of the art around me and realize I can make something just as beautiful, and how to condition and steel myself to deal with moments like this where I could crash again. I don't want that anymore.

How do I find out who I am? How do I decide jealousy from my system? How do I prevent this from happening at the magnitude that it is, again?"
1,"I feel like a failure. I was given a lot of time fr my project, but I keep procrastinating. I kept thinking about what I could add to the project to improve it, but I did not do any of those things. I kept dreaming about how I will do the project but never actually put in the effort. In fact, I just found out what I have done so far is kind of off topic. The project is due very soon and I haven't even submitted my first draft. I feel really depressed and unmotivated now. I dream and yet never did anything. I am a failure."
1,"If I still lived alone I probably wouldn’t even know about COVID-19 because I don’t leave the house in the first place.. I maybe left the house a total of 50 times or less in a total of 4 years due to major depressive disorder, I was diagnosed treatment resistant last year after trying every treatment known to man with zero relief"
1,"Has anyone actually fully recovered after being diagnosed treatment resistant major depressive?. I have been depressed for coming up on 4 years now, I have tried just about every treatment there is known. Zero relief. Has anyone ever recovered after being depressed so long?"
1,"Anti-Depressants don’t work for me at all.. Depressed for 4 years now, diagnosed treatment resistant. I have tried every treatment there is with zero relief. What’s next?"
1,"I need to let this out. Back in 2018 and early 2019 I was extremely depressed. I've always been a loner and struggled with anxiety but those two years hit me the hardest. I thought nothing was going to better. Then a girl that I was friends with for a very long time confessed that she had feelings for me. I thought everything was finally looking up for me. We ended up dating and I didn't feel depressed anymore, I genuinely believed that I was getting better. She actually listened to me and cared for me. Then not even a year later, she breaks my heart. The way she talked to me after our breakup made it seem like she never even loved me to begin with. 

So here I am, almost a week later, and it's hitting me really hard. I miss all the good memories and being in love. I keep blaming myself for the breakup and I don't know why. I only have one friend, and she is trying her best to make me feel better. But I'm honestly crushed and I feel more depressed than I was before I got in a relationship with my ex. I truly believe I'm meant to be alone forever because there is no way I'll ever have another girlfriend. Everyone just leaves me anyways.

Sometimes I just wish I would've just ended everything back in 2018 like I wanted to."
1,"Quarantine has destroyed my already waning motivation. Title. I had a bunch of school assignments I should’ve gotten done, I should’ve cleaned my room, etc. But with quarantine, what’s the point? My grades can’t decrease, who gives a shit about my room, and what’s the point to doing anything else?"
1,"this fucking sucks.. on top of quarantine and never leaving my house, which is leading me onto a huge spiral of depression, my boyfriend just broke up with me. he said he doesn't love me anymore. which i understand, you can't help your feelings, but god, you couldn't have picked a worst time to do it. 

i'm in so much pain. i want to escape all of this. i don't know what to do anymore. i guess i'm not worthy of love or affection. i understand, i guess. it just hurts. he was my world, i was so madly in love...he was the only reason i felt better during these times. fuck, i cant take this."
1,"Day by day. This is the only way I can live, past few years have been rough, and just keep getting worse. People say look for the light at the end of the tunnel , but that’s hard to do when you care about everyone else and they never care about what happens to you."
1,"Feeling Gloomy. I'm having a bout of depression, just needed a place to put it besides my journal. Some friends told me I can tell them anything anytime, but right now I don't want to word-vomit my mood to them too much. Nobody needs to respond. I can't put into words how hollow and lonely I am at this moment; I know I won't feel it as strongly when I wake up, which is somewhat a silver lining.

If you too are having a dark night of the soul, you aren't alone. I'm not alone. I just feel alone. As if a pane of glass stands between me and everyone in the world. I want so badly to reach out and connect. It's as if my humanity's slipped away. 

Thanks for letting me stamp my mind onto a board for the night. I know many of you are struggling. Hang in there"
1,"I just want it to stop. I feel so worthless, so bad. I just want to be fucking happy. I want to stop crying and I want it to stop hurting. Because everything hurts and I feel like it'll never stop and I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do."
1,"I'm too tired of this. I'm a guy, I already want to die and I will do it soon, iv been so deppresed since I was 13 because of a very traumatic experience I went through, I was raped, and I even tried to kill myself already at 15, I basicly mixed and swallowed a tons of pills, and for some reason all it did was make me sick for a few days, that was it

I'm 18 now and i have really tried to keep it under control and I feel far worse, I don't see myself living past 19, life for me it's completely unbearable."

1,Poor Hygiene. Anyone’s breath be so bad from not brushing for a day or 2 and you can taste it?
1,"Am I depressed?. I don’t know if I have depression or not but getting a real diagnosis just isn’t an option for me. Around 2 years back i was a very happy person and out of the blue my mind just went completely blank. I couldn’t talk to people because there was nothing in my mind and as a result I became very anxious and insecure. I skipped a lot of school and found myself becoming an emotional person out of nowhere. I was crying at movies and stuff like that. I was honestly confused more than anything as to why I was feeling this way and I kept trying to write it off as an off day but this lasted maybe ~5 months. 

I found some ways to deal with it so I wasn’t as hopeless but I still felt happy at times throughout those months and I still do now and I don’t know if what I think is “depression” is just a natural circumstantial emotional response. For instance I really don’t like myself but it’s just because I do things that are annoying, so is my low self esteem just a natural product of that instead of me having depression? Like if I was very likable and was popular and pretty I don’t think I’d be “depressed”. I’ve also self harmed a couple of times but I think deep inside I was doing it for some kind of attention or as a confirmation that I have actual depression and I’m not just a loser, and I get urges to self harm whenever I feel overwhelmed but I don’t know if I’m subconsciously wanting to do that for attention because I know there’s other ways to cope. 

Sorry if this is confusingly worded btw but I just want to know if I’m actually depressed or just circumstantially sad at times so I know how to deal with this"
1,"Terror. I want to leave something behind, but I can’t seem to begin to build anything. I want to love, but I can’t be loved back—not wholly, not unconditionally, the way I want to love.

I used to not care, but only recently, I learned what it means to give a damn about yourself. I almost wish I hadn’t come to that realization. It forces me to see that almost everyone else begins with this condition—knowing intuitively it is not only acceptable but perhaps even imperative to love the self. In the grand scheme, it is perhaps both inconsequential and myopic to obsess over such trivial matters; but I’ve chosen to disregard this truth as a result of the aforementioned realization.

I learned someone loved me, but they can’t fully love me, at least not now, at least not without consequences. It would be a disaster, but I pray for that disaster to materialize. The mere thought of building a new life from the scattered debris of a ravaged tower is perhaps a delusion, but that delusion is all I have; so I cling to it, even if it makes me appear a desperate, lonely madman, which is what I must confess I have recently been reduced to.

She has her obligation, which I understood from the beginning, something I never thought she or I could overcome—until recently, when she and I became closer then I ever could have imagined. I’ll remain distant, I bargained, until the storm passes, if it passes at all; but I was warned maintaining such distance as a matter of volition was an impossibility, at which point I resigned myself to the contemptible verity that I am merely a laborer of my own mind’s undiscerning whims.

How does one break free under such conditions? Once again surrender to that ever-encroaching pit of stagnation? Pray for the annihilation of that which will never be broken? Or battle through the biological impulse to remain alive for the benefit of all who secretly despise you?

I don’t want to think about where she is now. I don’t want to think about where she will be tomorrow. Yet when she’s with me, such terror dissipates. Perhaps it is yet another delusion of mine to believe that the terror will not again return."
1,"Tell me your reasons why. I myself struggle with problems caused by my depression. But I wanted to hear your story as to how depression may have come about in your life, and what is it that keeps you pushing, whether to just make it through the day or to just get better in general."
1,"I’ve been having suicidal thoughts all day.... Anyone wouldve thought I was ok, I’ve gotten good at acting like nothing’s wrong. Then out of nowhere I’m just like let’s do it today. I wish there was someone I could talk to other than a therapist about this stuff. I’ve brought it up to my sister who I’m very close with and she’s very honest with me when she says she doesn’t know how to react to that. But then I’m like well if someone I loved who’s life is seemingly perfect/ normal/good told me they want to die I wouldn’t know how to react either. If I were hearing myself I’d think what more does she want. She has a supportive family, good social life, stable job, nice things, phones cars ,food, roof above her head, not wealthy but also not dirt poor, I have everything and yet I want to die."

1,"Here's a sad story for you.... When I was in tenth grade I had a crush on this teacher, Mr.C. Not a spouse crush but a crush in a way where i wanted him to be a father figure to me. I was obsessed with standing out to him so he would like me, but everytime I talked to him I would come out awkward and shy. Last year, 11th grade, I walked back from the counselors office crying. I was put down by the counselor being  condescending. Through walking that hall all I wanted was Mr.C to be there. I wanted him to comfort me and tell me everything was going to be alright. I looked down as I cried when all of a sudden I see Mr.C turning the corner. I became shy and anxious. I remember him noticing me crying. He said ""How are you""in a sympathetic voice. I managed to mumble out a broken ""good"" as I swiftly walked past him. He said ""good, that's great"" and walked past me. That was it. No comfort, no acknowledgement, nothing. I walked to my class and he continued on his way. I wonder if he ever looked back. If he ever cared to ask me what was really wrong. Last year he got engaged. I was happy for him but jealous. Not of his wife but of his children who will grow up with a great dad. He moved to a different school this year and probably forgot my name."
1,"im so lost. I’ve always struggled with my mental health, but I’ve always just brushed it off. I get really anxious over everything and sad, but it feels like everyone does. This is probably gonna turn into a long incoherent rant, but I’ve never expressed how I felt before. I’ve lived a very privileged life and grew up in an amazing community. I love my parents (they’re immigrants and worked really hard to get where they are). I just feel so guilty for being so sad all the time. I don’t even know why; I’m just always sad. But its always manageable; I do well in school, and I’m going to a really good university in the fall. I have several close friends, but I’m just so lonely all the time. I don’t know why I feel so guilty. I thought my mental health had been improving over the years, but today I was so angry and irritated at everything and I don’t know why. (and its not my period because I can also get very bitchy before my period). I just got so mad and I’ve been sitting on my floor for hours. I even cut myself for the first time in a really long time (I never did it much, but I have a hard time crying, so it helps me feel something when I get stressed). I’ve always thought my mental health issues weren’t bad, and I’m insecure, but what hormonal teen isn’t. Wow this is really long, and I don’t know if anyone will read this. I want to talk to someone, but every time it gets this bad, I chicken out, and then it usually passed quickly and I just shove all my emotions deeper, and I will be fine, and not think about it for a while. I get so anxious making an (semi) anonymous post. I’ve only posted on reddit once before. I don’t know why I got so angry today, and I feel so bad for being angry even though I didn’t seem angry. Sometimes I will get so angry at things that don’t even matter, and I spend so long obsessing over it. It’s also not like I can’t control my anger, but then again I just bottle everything up. I also want to stop obsessing over everything; it makes me so stressed. I sent a text to a friend and I thought I sounded mean and got so worried, but it wasn’t even mean, I was just answering her question. I feel like everyone hates me, but then I feel like no one cares about me. All my mental health symptoms seem so mild to me; I just don’t want to feel like this all the time. This will probably pass in a few days anyways."
1,"Everything feels like a roller coaster. Background: I’m a 14 year old freshmen. I’m doing great on my online learning, everything completed to perfection and turned in on time but I feel empty. This quarantine has been really rough for me mentally. I feel like I’m wasting away. I feel so insecure about my weight and I want to do something about it but I constantly think I’m being judged by everyone so I skip. I can’t even fast right; I wanted to fast so I could lose weight, 1 hour later I was having a second portion of dinner. The thing that depresses me the most is my gaming addiction, I’ll spend 8 hours a day on it, only a couple of nights ago did I play until 12 and it was soul crushing, I had friends with me but I felt like I’m wasting away my youth. All I do is sit inside all day either watching anime, playing video games, or sitting in my room thinking of bad things are. My biggest fears haven’t even came yet. My biggest fear is summer, I live near a public pool and I love going swimming, until recently, my body image issues have gotten so bad I don’t even want to go swimming. How can I compete in looking passable when I’m swimming with friends who are athletes. This concludes my 1 am rant about how My life seems terrible but really isn’t."
1,"I feel like if I'm trapped in my own memories. All I do is keep thinking about the past, remembering memories whether they were bad or good...
I feel sad when I remember the bad ones , but sadder when I remember the good ones and know that they will never be lived again ....
Memories with my father, friends, persons who I'll never get to share life with again whether because they're dead or because they are alive but can't be together cuz that's how life is.

The future is also so exhausting for me to think of... 

I spend most of my day by myself in my room, mostly doing nothing ... I don't have real friends, just connections whom I don't hang out with, I feel bored easily of people....

What do you guys think about thid ? And How to get out of this state please?"
1,"Uncertain about ""friends"". I don't really know the friends I have, or if I can even consider them that in the first place. They all live in time zones hours ahead of mine, and I've never seen them in person. One of them, I happen to have a crush on. They reply really sparsely, yet they're always apologising for just that. I don't know if they're just putting up with me for the hell of it. Maybe because they feel sorry for me? I've always been frightened that I'm uninteresting, and even when it seems like I'm having a good conversation, I can't help but wonder if they care at all.

This always affects my ability to focus properly, I'm always tired and it hurts me mentally. There's a balcony just outside the front door, and it fuels my thoughts of suicide. I berate myself, while actually visualising jumping off, but I know I could never commit suicide. I'm absolutely too scared to do it (my fear of heights sure helps), and the pain it'd bring my family would be horrible.

I want some kinda help, but not medication, and not a therapist. Yes, I know that my problems are menial, and I don't have the worst depression out there. There are people here who have it much worse than I do, and believe me, I support them all the way, but I can't help but feel as if I am worthless."
1,"Tired of being tired. Insomnia, loneliness, memories that just wont leave my brain alone. I’m so fucking tired of this all. I want a break. I want to rest. I want my life back... I want my wife back. I miss it all. Transitioning is such a double edged sword. I can’t not be me... but it all went downhill after starting. Fuck am I supposed to do, now? I have methods to go; that helps reassure me. It’s like every day I’m more ok with just going...

There’s a universe where shit goes right for me. There’s gotta be."
1,Losing control.. There have been 2 instances within the last 7 days of my dark mind taking over my body and ordering me to use a towel like a damn noose and strangle myself with it. The second instance was earlier tonight. I collapsed and almost passed out. My life is agony.
1,"Maybe I am not good enough (rant ig). I dont rly know how to start this so ig ill just get into it but i... genuinely feel like i'm not good enough for people and that i'm lacking, especially for my boyfriend
He reassures me time and time again that i am good enough and that i treat him rly well and nicely but i feel like he's only saying that to try and appease me and that if we lived together he'd see how shitty and useless i am and will want to leave and will regret ever loving me and wasting time on me (we're in a ldr)

I feel stupid and useless, i doubt i can get a job so i'm worried about us living together and me just being a burden which makes me believe that i would need to eat less or not at all and try not to use too much electricity or water so that the bills wont be too high

Even now at home, majority of my family (save for my sister in law) all work from home and are contributing something but i'm not doing anything at all so i feel bad and like i'm leeching off of them
So i try not to eat too much so we can save on food and water (drink, not shower) because of the pandemic going on also

I don't rly have anyone to talk to this about and even if i want to talk about smth to my psych i can't because i Physically and Emotionally cannot ever appear to be Not okay if im seeing someone in person or if i know this person already
Like if i even try to try to talk about my feelings or vent out to a friend or even to her (psych) i'll feel super guilty for it and like i'm a brat
I have wanted to talk to her abt more serious things but i just Can't and end up talking about other things that don't impact me as much as the Big Things i want to talk about

Idk, ig i just wanted to vent out here so i dont really expect anyone to reply to this but if you read the whole thing, thank you for your time"
1,"I've lost my identity. I was clinically depressed for over two years. Now, after intensive therapy and a long rollercoaster, I'm moving out/have finally moved out of clinical diagnosis. My therapy sessions are spreading out more and I'm on the verge of no longer needing them anymore. I haven't seriously thought about hurting myself in a long time. I don't know who I am without this though.

My therapist and I have been talking about this the last few sessions; I need to find an identity that doesn't revolve around me being depressed. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to not center my being around me being broken. I don't feel broken anymore but I feel lost. Who do I even talk to about this? Isn't talking about it playing into the problem? Isn't me asking my friends or my family ""who am I without my depression"" making it about my depression? How do I let my loved ones know that I'm scared and lost without also making it feel like something is wrong with me? I know that I'm not any less because of my depression. I know that I'm not broken because of it. But that's all I know. And I need to know more."
1,Idk. Idk why I’m here. I think I’m depressed but idk. I just feel so lonely like every day. And have felt like this for many years. Friends are starting to be more distant. I have never had true love or even anything close to it. And I barely have any family. I don’t know what to do. I have almost stopped caring about anything. This corona shit isn’t helping my situation either. Idk what to expect from this reddit. Just wanted to get this off my chest cause nobody close to me knows what I’ve been going through.

Going to a lab instead of a doctor is prohibitively expensive. I decided I'd wasted enough of my life, and if I couldn't get legal drugs, promising illegal drugs like ketamine and MDMA would have to be my recourse.

I know that the extreme tiredness and the lack of focus and sensitivity to light and sound are normal side effects in the beginning, but I just want to make sure I'm covering all my bases!

1,"What if you just have done what you desired without being judged. You see here, the reason I am still alive is because I have been controlled by a type of devil named feelings. I always wanted to die and I hate my life every single day even the small things to the big things at my point make me think that. I was always a happy looking person, but deep down I am a dead body buried deep down the soil in a coffin. I have always wanted to kill myself but if I did what would happen. First of all, nobody would believe the fact I killed myself, and they would wonder why. Normally, I look like a normal person outside since I would not express myself a lot to other people. I might leave my family and my friends and they would be sad and depressed and now that would cause more and more and more never ending problems. You see you are being controlled by this world this hell like society forcing you to do things you don’t like and brainwashing you. But there is also another thing that is torturing you, it belongs to you but somehow you cannot control it. It is your feelings, you might wonder, why? Here, let me explain, so look at why you wont kill yourself since it is because the society brainwashed you saying that it is bad and cowardly, and by leaving your family behind and feelings will make you *feel* guilty. The reason you didn’t do the things you love is because this society and the devil feelings is controlling you right now. Everything you know, everything you say is controlled by feelings and society. So lets look at this shit at the other angle. What if, you just got cancer, out of nowhere, it happened and you would die. That would be great but that is where feelings would come in and start torturing you. You wouldn’t want to leave your family behind but you wanted to die which in this scenario it have accomplished your dreams for you. But sometimes a person’s feelings is an angel to them they would do anything to make themselves happy. Now that is where society comes in and starts torturing them. Wanna know why? Here, since they would do anything to fill their joy and if an *angel feeling* person killed themselves since they wouldn’t think too much and that will lead to trouble for people around him. Sounds bad right, it sounds bad because society brainwashed you. It wants you to think the way that you weren’t supposed to think. Why is life hard, it is because of the modern society and depression is becoming more common and more common because of all these shit. The feelings, the stress, the people are all because of this society. Why would your feelings become a devil trying to make you think the other way. You were born in this horrible society, it is how it worked when you were born. And fuck it, fuck this society, fuck this world, fuck everything I own, fuck you god, why would this happen to us at this specific time. Why would these rare angel feelings exist, maybe some people think the other way, for some reason, these people think the other way when they are born. Or, maybe they developed other things living here in this hell but really rare. It matters the most about how you wanted to think and this world controls that. It is making you depressed and it is making us bad. Well, at the end of this long crap which might be bad, I hope you would find yourself a better future, and think that the reason of living is not because of money since the society is like that, the society make life worth money and a lot of people including me wants to end it. I hope this post makes you feel better. And wow, you made it down here, thanks! See you"
1,"Anger gone out of hand. Suffering with depression for the past 4-5 years and I've had help on and off.

One of the worst symptoms I think I experience is irritability and anger. It is just out of hand at this point. 

I mainly divert my anger towardd my family and never my friends or strangers or classmates. 

But I lash out terribly at them , especially my mom. My poor mom. It gets rough sometimes, and it really only just starts with me back talking. Which will then result in her talking back to me sometimes and then I will completely lose my shit, and just shout or swear. 

I dont ever usually yell any insults directed towards her, I will usually just mindlessly yell about my anger, or sometimes I will yell at her blaming her for how I am now, or yell at her over a stupid argument over something like a cup, etc.. alongside that, if I am in a bad mood I will just snap back at her my response instead of responding like a civilized person.

I feel bad, but In the moment I do not always feel bad. I have a hard time finding a healthy outlet for my thoughts so i personally believe that it comes expressed through aggression.

It is usually that I am sensitive and I just pick fights with everyone in the house. 

Its terrible because I know I'm being a pain in the ass, but it's worse because I dont have it under control and im putting people I care about under unacceptable remarks and a bitchy attitude all because I had a bad day.

Is this something meant for anger management?
Are there any mechanisms that can get me to stop myself before I lash out? To recognize that there are innocent people I deeply care about in front of me and that I shouldn't act that way towards them? I can feel my rage unnecessarily build up in the moment and then before I know it, it unleashes on everyone."
1,"Fuck it. I've been planning my suicide for a while now. I just needed to figure out how exactly. Well I've settled. Shotgun to the face while sitting on train tracks. 100% death rate.

My problems? 

Can't connect with anyone.

I'm 5'9 which is very short to most people it seems.

I'm 75% black 25% Korean so nobody looks like me.
I'm unemployed.

No car or license.

Not in school.

I sleep on a couch.

My penis is 6 inches give or take which is apparently really small.

I'm starting to get skinny fat.

I'm 22 and losing my youth.

Depression stole my teen years.

I'm apparently attractive but I'm too fucked up for anyone to love.

The only girl who would love me left after I fucked it up.

I'm still stuck on said girl since December 2018.

I've got Tinnitus that's probably connected to my TMJ/Dz but I'm too scared to call a dentist/specialist and being told I'm not enough of an emergency to see. (Fuck Covid)

That Tinnitus makes things lose meaning because all I'm able to think about is the ringing.

My only passion is music but the ringing makes me depressed as hell when I'm in my studio.

And lastly. I've got no future.

so fuck it. soon as I get my taxes I'm buying the gun. and walking to the train tracks."

1,"Nobody loves me. Today was a great day. My girlfriend dumped me out of nowhere and said it’s not you it me. I know this was a lie and it crushed me. Later on in the day my friend got mad at me for not reason and said nobody loves me, the said part is I know that’s true. I feel like there no point to any of this shit called life anymore. Now I’m just sitting in my room with a rope around my neck. God I hate being alive it’s all pain and suffering, nothing matter we all die in the end."
1,"I don’t want to die, I just want to disappear.. At night I lay awake next to my boyfriend thinking about how little motivation I have to do my school work, to go to work, to get dressed, to be productive. I sometimes catch myself thinking “I don’t want to be here.” But what I mean is I wish everything outside this apartment didn’t exist. I wish it was just us, here. I wish there was no stress or pressure from the outside.  I want to be happy."
1,"Inadequate. During my last semester at university I failed two of my classes, Calc and Chem. I didn’t really seem to mind it at the time and I figured I would just grind more for the next semester but after classes started back up in January I got into a real bad headspace and haven’t been able to get out of it. I’m failing the same two classes and haven’t had any motivation to study or do homework. Initially I thought it would pass but it hasn’t and now I’m fairly convinced it’s legitimate depression. Every time I try and do anything productive I think to myself I’m useless and stupid and I’ll never graduate. Ive been feeling inadequate because my gf is a 4.0 student with a full ride to college and even though she is supportive of me I can’t help but feel now that all I am is a burden to her and that I drag her down. All of this shit is from one bad semester but I just don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone has any advice for how to get over this I would be greatly appreciative."
1,"Had to call the suicide hotline tonight. I really don’t want to go into why but I just want to say that they are 100% worth calling. I’ve had so many nights like tonight where the thought creeps in and takes over and calling them rarely crosses my mind and when it does I immediately reject the idea out of denial that it would do any good. Tonight they really helped me. I’m a very sensitive person and need to be spoken to in a specific sort of way and oh my god they did it. Of course I’m not cured of depression or anything but I really needed that reassurance and comfort tonight. If you are ever hesitant to call, just do it. They won’t give you cookie cutter responses like you might be expecting and are definitely worth a try for when you are at your lowest."

At school, I isolate myself because I don´t want to make myself look like a fool trying to talk to someone.

1,"I just climbed out onto my roof, and I laughed?. Depressed teen here, hi:) I’m your typical good grades no drugs or alcohol girl, the one everyone thinks is super smart and has a future but just got the short stick on circumstances. I’ve grown up my whole life afraid, afraid of what people might think, or do, or might act. If I don’t do the right thing I’ll get punished, or yelled at. Maybe I’ll be kicked out and not able to finish school. I worry often, about everything. The only reason I’m alive is cause my brother and sister but mainly my cat. My cat has been missing for weeks and I played it off as I couldn’t help it, like it’s not my fault. Today, I was doing my online classes and biology sucks. Finally I just broke down, all my stress I’ve been keeping in, my thoughts, my sadness. I just cried, and I cried, at first I blamed it on my biology homework but I know that it was deeper than that. I kinda laid in my bed for the last few hours just, waiting, for nothing.

My window has a ledge off it where I can go put on, if I fell I wouldn’t die but would definitely get hurt. But I can also climb higher up. Anyway, I’ve always been scared to do anything “bad” because what if I get caught? What if the moment I decide to do something someone catches me or shows up? The neighbors? Anyone. But tonight I opened my window, I crawled out and I sat against my window. I played my music. I felt like at any moment I could slip from this ledge and... if I fell, I’d be caught. Not even concerned for myself. And I sat there, and I laughed. I laughed for a good five minutes. My legs were trembling and I laughed.

I don’t know if I have deeper root problems or something but, that’s the first time I ever did anything “bad” like sneaking out or what not. I felt crazy for laughing, but it felt so good. 

Shortened: I’m a goody two shoes with depression and tonight I did something I usually wouldn’t and I laughed and don’t think that’s normal but it felt good:)

Id like to add, I hope this post isn’t offensive and you think I’m just some teen who had a moment and thought she was depressed. I’d like to clarify I’ve been suicidal, scared and depressed since I was 12 years old. (Just for clarifications sake idk? I just feel like I have to explain myself? And I don’t wanna go that deep into it. Anyway have a goodnight)"
1,I want to stab myself. I want to bleed all over the place and be put under intensive care to prove that I am as sad as I say I am. To see who really cares. And the feeling of blood pouring out is like no other. It cant be that bad can it? I once slowly stabbed into my wrist with a dull box cutter. I'll never forget the pop noise when it got through. Then I cut a small piece of skin out with scissors. Stabbing my stomach quickly cant hurt as much as that can it?.
1,"I don’t want to up my meds. kind of a rant ...
my ex got into three Ivy League Universities and it triggered this. 

This Covid-19 cause me to loose my support system, I live in a difficult household so I’m on edge constantly. I FaceTimed my psych (which I do in secret) and she said I should go up 50mg more on my prescription and I was relatively happy talking to her? Am I blind? I don’t know how I feel and what if she sees something I can’t? This just justifies my insecurities, I thought I was getting better?! 
 
Fast forward a few days to now: 
so I think being perfect will cure my depression, hA so my ex got into these schools and I’m here with uva which 10 people (among such I don’t enjoy) are going with me. I feel like there is something so wrong with me to be rejected I think why them what do they have that I don’t? Maybe If I wasn’t so depressed for the past two years I would have done better in high school! I think I’m dumb I think I’m not good enough and I never will be."
1,"I want to die.  I whisper into the faceless sea of the internet, such words that could never be given voice

I love you. I really do and I've known you such a long time.

I wanted to tell you those months ago. I've wanted to tell you all this time...and now you keep on hitting up my phone, like I'll be working in the city next year with you. 

And all I can think about is what would it be like?

It hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can't be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that. Would drugs make drowning less painful?

What about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.

A frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you wouldn't even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.

But what about mom? and grandma? or even Dad, even though I hate him? Or the dog?

God I love you, that subtle way you flirt with these messages, you, laughing at my stupid jokes and me, so impotent, so awed by you that I cannot act. You are beautiful the way you are now.

fuck, maybe ill buy a rope"
1,"I can’t remember the last time I was happy. I have been sad for a long time. It’s been so long that I can’t even remember a time I was happy. I recently told a girl that I had feelings for her. But I knew she didn’t feel the same. But even still, this is like the most sad I’ve been for being rejected. I’ve always been bummed, but I’ve never actually been sad. And this is the saddest I’ve ever been for something like that. And being a young guy, (I’m 15) I wanna say that it’s just being a teen, and that there would be plenty of other girls, but I don’t want any other girls, I want her. She’s treated me better than most of my friends. She understands me. I go to her when I’m stressed, and she never complains about me going to her, even though she should. Sorry I’m just ranting but really. I don’t want money or anything. I just want her. And I just want to be happy. Thank you for reading"

1,"Im confused. Hi,

Im contemplating whether to go on a consultation for my mental health or not. Honestly I'm too ashamed to get seek medical attention, next is the cost. But its taking a toll on me as the days go by especially this quarantine period. So please help me to decide, thank you"
1,"Depression reeling its ugly head again and I wishing I could disappear. The combination of quarantine and getting laid off from my job in the span of a month is confirmation that I don't belong in this society. For several months, I thought I was gradually getting my shit together despite the feelings of hopelessness surfacing here and there. Felt like I was overcoming it. I was even  thinking of planning for the future. Now, I've reverted back to feeling worthless. There's nothing more I want to do than die but I hold on because my partner and family would be sad if I did and I'm too chicken to go ahead and pull the trigger."
1,"I don't feel sad, I feel empty.... After my girlfriend broke up with me, I cried for the first day but after that I didn't feel sad, I still don't and I realized that I don't feel anything else, I feel empty, all I can think of is her, I used to play games as a hobby and now even that reminds me of her, I hate my situation because I know that I'm going to be okay, that I will get over her, and that I may find someone else, but I don't want that all I want is her, not someone else.
Sorry for my rant but I had to get it out have a nice morning/day/night."

1,"I don’t know if I can keep going. I just think life is completely pointless. The only thing that keeps me here is my fear of an afterlife. When I’m with people, I feel even more lonely. I joke around to mask my pain and nobody realizes just how tortured I am inside. I’m running out of options."
1,"I'm depressed. But I am also extremely ugly and thus I will never have a boyfriend.. When I say I'm ugly, I promise you, I am ugly. There's nothing wrong with saying it. I'm just ugly. My sister is the complete opposite, she's gorgeous, skinny, with an amazing body and face. She's literally been hit up on instagram by several modelling agencies. She has over 10k followers on there.

The moment anyone meets here and sees me, they're shocked. Like, what the fuck happened? Me being the sister of someone who's completely drop dead gorgeous and you've got me looking like a deformed man.

I can't ever imagine anyone wanting to be with me, my body is horrible as I've lost weight and the skin is just bad. I've got very bad social anxiety which was inherited but also worse because of how I look.

Imagine if I DID ever get a boyfriend? they would see my sister and think ""wtf?"" like everyone else. I've only ever had a boyfriend online who didn't know the extent of how ugly I am bc of my extreme use of filters and editing. Literally I am pathetic.

There's nothing going for me anymore. I have 0 friends in real life and anyone online I talk to doesn't know the extent of how ugly I am.

I discovered yesterday that I actually have an underbite thus making my face appear longer and my chin bigger. It's set me off so badly and I actually don't want to live being this ugly anymore. Everything on my face and body is just fucked up, I have NO good features. Extremely wonky and bent nose, huge chin and jaw, big forehead, too tall, big feet and hands, saggy breasts, sagging skin on my stomach and thighs, lazy eye with uneven eyebrows. I want plastic surgery so bad but in my situation it will never happen. It doesn't help that I'm 6ft tall as a female, even less options as not many guys want a tall girlfriend.

No one will ever want me. I'm a 22 year old female who's never even had a first kiss. It is no ones fault but my own but looking like this and my mental issues I just can't anymore..."
1,"Just when I thought. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, the universe proved me wrong. 

I was doing fine this past few days, I can control my overthinking, I was empty but atleast not in pain, I thought no one could shook me up anymore. Not until last night when we receive the news that my brother hasn’t come home yet and we can no longer contact him. 

Me,My Mom and Grandma was up all night (I live 9 hrs away from them) we were just notified by my brothers friend at around 11 PM that my brother left the house around 2 PM  to get the money that their employeer has sent them and hasnt come home since. We cant still file a report to the police since it hasnt been 24 hours yet.

I wasn’t able to sleep the whole night, I was worried about my brother and I was even more worried about my mon and grandma. Just this morning his friend was able to found him, He was caught and was put to Jail bcoz of drugs. He tested positive for the drug test. He live at another and since we have the pandemic theirs nothing we can fo about it.

I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID TO DESERVE SUCH A MESSY LIFE. The universe can’t give me a break."
1,"Im a cold miserable bitch. I'm a 21 year old female and I want to die. Not because I'm too depressed to go on, but because my family is crushing me. My parents had a baby when I was 11 years old. My brother is turning 10. My dad tought my brother how to do an oil change on our car. They never offered that to me. They didnt even force me into drivers ed when i was in high school. Now I'm an adult that cant drive. I dont have a job because I dont want to rely on my parents to take me to work. Its like theyve given up on me and are trying to do better with my brother. However, they only placate him when it comes to things he likes. I genuinely feel that my parents shouldnt have had another kid..."
1,"Had a weird moment today.. I’ve been battling depression for almost 5 years now, and I’ve had the gamut of peaks and valleys, most stemming from crippling loneliness and self hate, but one thing that comes with an ongoing fight is the insight that you gain along the way.  For the most part, I know when the voice in my head is taking control of my world perception at least enough to talk myself off of most ledges of pain, but today was different today I went into my bed and straight up just gave up, the voice in my head said “it was ok to just take the L this time and recoil to safety”, and I accepted it without hesitation .  Even at my worst, I’ve never kinda just thrown in the towel so quickly and easily,  maybe it’s the quarantine in a single apartment after 28 days idk, it was just weird to go so contently into a little depression hole for 3hrs.

I hope everyone is doing ok out there, pandemic or not, we’re all just people trying to stay out of bed."
1,"Idk how to express how I feel. How do people find it so easy to talk to somebody about why you feel the way you do. Like I can say it in my head but I seem to not know how to translate into words. How do I tell my friends that I'm depressed and have been for a really long time without saying, ""oh yeah I'm depressed"". Or how do I tell my Hispanic mom who doesn't speak English that depression is an actual thing that affects me mentally and physically and not me just trying to get her attention. This is dumb"
1,"now i know why i am depressed. part 1. * i was not depressed as a child but as i got older and started to see my family behave the way they do, i fell into the same trap as them.
* my depression is contagious. i have inherited it from my father who is sadly depressed for the last 20 years.
* i am 22. my father got depressed because of career disappointment, hardships, family struggle and underachievement. he was devastated when all his hard work went into vain.
* he stopped socializing, remains silent, lost in thoughts, blames others, doesn't take responsibility, panics a lot, no joy, no happiness in life, never travels, never goes out except for work, doesn't speak much and also gets angry at us if we enjoy ourselves. he makes us feel guilty for enjoying the life and being happy, threatens suicide. it is clear that failure and embarrassment have ruined his self esteem and self worth.
* not achieving his desired job had ruined his life. while growing up, i was told that this is my father's ""personality"" by my mother (who is a little narcissistic, blames my father for not getting a good job, always concerned about herself, doesn't listen to him talking, victim mentality, superiority complex, puts others down, overly criticizing and controlling nature, thinks she is too good for others, in the 23 years of their marriage my parents have NEVER NEVER EVER talked because my mother thinks that emotions are drama and only ""useless people talk about emotional stuff"" and she is too smart and optimistic to get serious).
* okay. both my parents are victims of life. while my father is sure rude, but failure kills you and i don't know if i should blame him. mother, on the other hand, is caring but doesn't sympathize with my father. she thinks of herself as a human while all others as animals. as if she is a victim in every case and others are her enemies. she expects others to behave well, but she can be childish, crying, shouting, and then threatens us that we will face our fate when we have our own kids.
* i see that the rest of my family who are successful in life have qualities very different from us: they are self assured, sympathetic, cheerful, good at socializing, take responsibility, think that everything is possible, have large social circle (we don't), encourage and believe in their children, doesn't put themselves down in front of others, don't threaten suicide, travel a lot, live lie to the fullest wherever they are. they also talk to their children (my parents don't) and encourage them to achieve great heights, when in problems they don't cry and moan, but look for solutions, stay chill and take control. on the other hand, my father goes into panic mode and blames others and seeks help from others for his problems. he stays distant in social gatherings and stays aloof in a corner.
* sadly my father has never got help for depression. no one even cares about him and that he has depression. i don't know if even he knows whether he has it. he is done with life. since my mother doesn't love him and he doesn't love my mother, their lives are miserable."
1,"Nothing feels real. Its like I've been living a simulation for years. I don't feel any emotions, I don't have a care in the world. It's like every day I'm waking up to this fake world I wish I could get out of."
1,I don't know how much longer I can take it. I really don't know what to say. I don't have any words. I'm getting worse. I'm not okay.
1,"I feel like I'm terrible at everything. All my life people have made me feel like I'm shit at everything that I do or touch even if I love it. In Highschool, I was in soccer and I loved it so much but everyone was so hateful towards me and made me feel like the worst to ever touch a ball, they made me cry weekly and made me feel mentally pathetic and they acted as if they never even talked to me or know what they did, and even in my life's passion of snakes and venomous reptiles, someone said that it's bullshit that I'm educated/experienced with them only because I asked a simple question. I just feel so lonely and hated and that I can't do anything right."
1,"The nights are the worse for me. I have no reason you feel this way, yet it always comes back. The creeping feeling that breathing is just not worth it, that it will happen anyway. I have no reason to feel this way, but... I really have no reason to feel otherwise. 

I feel like I do a lot just to avoid feeling this way,  but during the night, alone in bed, it hits me like a truck.

""Worthless, useless, you'll never be happy""

 
Shut up, brain. Please. Shut up and let me sleep."
1,"I need advice. I went through a horrible breakup a couple years ago. The person I dated was a pathological liar and narcissist, and I have so many trust issues from the relationship. My depression and anxiety have gotten worse over the last year, and seeing a therapist hasn't helped. I don't have feelings for him anymore, because the guy I liked never truly existed, but it feels like I can't have strong feelings for anyone ever again. It's not that I won't let myself, it's that I genuinely don't find anyone as good as I thought he was... does anyone have any advice for me?"
1,"At this point I desire for nothing better than to be a nihilistic black void of hatred that brings depression to everyone else around me.. If I cannot be happy, then I can at least make everyone else depressed, huh?"
1,"The Stress is about to make me lose my mind. I remember that the stress began when I was like 15. I could handle it then, things seemed a little brighter. Maybe not swell since I was already suicidal, but it wasn't this god damn bad. The depression started around the same time. 15, normal time to have depression or anxiety problems as a kid, right? 16 hit and I tried to work on myself, call me a quitter or a failure all you want. I started to hit the gym with my brother to the best I could do. I studied harder. Showered more often, ate less, ate better, tried to explore whatever semblance of a passion for anything I had. I don't want to turn this into a pity party, cuz this is all my fault in the end, I know that, I accept that, but God, fucking, damn. I never gained muscle, never toned, never lost weight doing the cardio. I failed more classes as I tried harder in them, I still managed to smell like shit after I kept clean constantly, I am still a fat fuck to this day. But now I am a skinny/fat fuck. I just watched the scale drop to 199, from 250 back when I was 16. I don't know why but this triggered me to write this. That stress has just built up to such a horrific summit now, at 19. The real world is hitting hard. Two dead end jobs that I've nearly lost due to Covid. Friends leaving me cuz I'm too busy. Rent pilling up for the parents who don't care. Got another rejection letter from another school for being too retarded to be apart of them. God it's like there's a fire in my skull all day long, all night long. I have dreams of being stressed. Of being light on fire. Or just dying. Doing anything to make this burning in my skull stop. I do the meditations, the fucking Japanese hand holding thing. I pray and I exercise still, but god, nothing nothing nothing calms me down. Nothing keeps the fire out of my head. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to lose it. I can't sleep anymore. It's been nearly two days. I'm sorry for a rant post from a whiney bitch but god damn. My therapist won't listen to me so I don't have anywhere else to go."
1,I’m such a fuck up.. I always worry everyone and being a burden comes naturally to me. It’s probably my only life skill.
1,A wave is hitting me real hard right now. Everything just feels hopeless. I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone and I feel like I don’t deserve anything. The usual shit blah blah you get it. Why does my mind have to fucking be like this
1,"I just feel alone. I've posted in this subreddit a dozen times, but never gotten as much as a couple comments, but it still feels nice just to vent, so here we go again. I don't have any real life friends, I haven't since high school. I've always suffered from social anxiety, and even if I could muster the courage I live in a small town and there's nowhere to go where you could really meet people. I have my online friends, but I always feel like I value them way more than they value me. It's hard not to feel that way when you have something you'd like to say to them, but you feel like you can't because the last 3 messages in the group chat were also from you. I guess it's just rough not having really felt wanted for years now."
1,"I somehow found a way to feel good while feeling real bad at the same time. Was on the verge of the chasm of mental breakdown but someone told me some real good news and it doesn't really feel good per se, but rather like falling with style into an I'm not okay anymore, and i know the good part of this won't last long, and I, after so many years, still don't know what to do about it."
1,I accidentally cut my skin. And that is not as painful as i imagined. So i continued and made some pattern on my skin. It makes me feel better now.
1,"Lost my mojo ... is it depression?. Not much makes me happy....I distract myself with video games and Facebook and reddit.  I lost my business...and after being the boss...every other job sucks. I’m not qualified for anything, really. Thought of going to school for a year or two for another shitty job doesn’t appeal. Getting older...no chance of an early retirement.  There’s got to be more to life.  Working a dead end, corporate, cubicle, sales customer service shit job for the rest of my life makes me want to die.  At some point I’m just going to throw it all in, give it away leave it behind and go on an adventure till my money runs out and then I’ll be homeless and then?"
1,"I just need to get my feelings out. I've been through a lot of shit, and that shit keeps on adding up. My few friends say it gets better but it feels like it isn't. I know my friends mean well, but I feel trapped in this bubble of hopelessness, I'm seeing how good everyone else's lives are, how many friends they have that care about them, how fun their lives are, and it feels like I'll end up dying one way or another before I get to experience that"
1,"Crying. Why do I want to cry about everything? I mean everything, others success/failure/gain/loss. People giving me praise/advice/hard time/criticism. When I hear preaching. Talk to any family member, Etc. I just don’t get it I’m crying posting this. 35yr/m married 15 yrs with a 15 yr old daughter. Struggled with addiction in past, still not perfect but night and day from what I was. I feel I have a hard time living in the moment. Sorry I’m rambling never sought help/advice/vented, whatever this is."
1,"Anxiety and depression won't allow me to sleep anymore. Woke up at 4am to my 18 month old daughter crying because she lost her pacifier. Husband was next to me asleep like usual.

During the day I can barely keep my eyes open. During the day I am working from home like  most people are during this pandemic. When I try to take a nap, there is too much noise going on so can't really get a solid nap in either if I do fall asleep. 

On top of that, I have several things I have been dealing with: 

\- I have depression for which I take antidepressants. These antidepressants give me the side effect of dilating one pupil more than the other and causes me headaches. I wear glasses to help combat the headache. I can't really stop taking the antidepressants cause you should never go cold turkey on them. 

\- I've also been having a thyroid issue. It's enlarged and will need to be partly removed in June (hopefully, if it doesn't get canceled due to Corona). I've been feeling like I'm going through menopause: Sweating, hot flashes, emotional, ... I'm 28 years old ... 

\- Got scoliosis and kyphosis. Used to go to the chiropractor for treatment but since the pandemic I can't and I've been having muscle spasms and pretty bad back pain. 

\- My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer spread to the liver and peritoneum. She got her 5th chemo a week ago. She's doing well but we're currently not speaking of her being cured or being able to have the operation to remove the ovaries and cancer. 

\- My husband has PTSD (Army veteran) and has depression. Takes antidepressants as well as I do. No side effects luckily but he's usually quite negative, easily discouraged and likes to game all day every day if I let him. He moved to my country with me and the daughter for a better life and his integration program has been postponed due to Corona. He's not happy having to wait, he wants to work so bad. 

This pandemic has me worried. I am always super careful, keep my distance, wear gloves, wear a mask, wash my hands when I come in and use handsanitizer, immediately shower right after coming back and then I allow myself to go say hi to my mom and my daughter (we all live in the same household btw). I am terrified ... What if I picked up the virus but don't know, what if I give it to my mom with stage 4 cancer, what if I give it to my daughter or my husband. I don't know if my mom would survive it in her condition ... So much anxiety ... 

I would love to hear some tips and tricks on how to be able to get some sleep and calm myself down enough so I don't go absolutely insane. 2020 has been awful so far and I am expecting to see the 4 horsemen and Cthulhu this year at this point. Thank you guys for reading!

TLDR: 28 year old with depression, antidepressants causing pupil issues and headaches, thyroid issues, scoliosis and kyphosis, my mom with stage 4 cancer, an 18 month old and an immigrant stay-at-home husband with PTSD would like some advice on how to be able to finally get some well needed sleep!"
1,"Anyone taking Zoloft and SUPER tired?. I've been taking 150 mg daily of Zoloft for several months (last September I think is when my doc increased the dosage from 50) now and have also been consistently exhausted almost 24/7. I can function and feel energized for a couple of hours if I drink an energy drink (which I know is a bad solution but is my band aid for the moment so I can get homework done). 

Does anyone else experience this, or could it be unrelated?"
1,"Everything makes me so mad and I can’t trust anyone. Hi, I’m sorry to be wasting your time with some crappy complaint but I need somewhere to dump my thoughts, after this past week I don’t think I have the strength left to pretend to smile. I found out the friends I’ve known for seven years were only my friends to make me feel better, and they all hated me. They sent dozens of messages telling me I’m awful and disgusting and things I already thought myself. Every little thing that goes wrong just seems like the end of the world, I can’t stop myself from just crying sometimes and I can’t trust anyone anymore. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to think I have any sort of depression or anxiety but I just can’t tell, how do I make the bad thoughts go away, I just wanna be able to sleep well again."
1,"How can I tell if I'm still depressed if I've been depressed for most of my life?. I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since about 4 or 5 years old. I think so because I don't remember ever feeling happy or content as a child and all of my earliest memories feel off somehow when I think about them. I always felt bored with everything and thought that I didn't know how to smile. I realized I was depressed when I was about 6. I don't know how I knew what depression was but I knew I had it. I hated myself, thought constantly about dying, suffered from intense loneliness, thought I was unlovable, just wanted to disappear. Fortunately, I've never self harmed.

I've never been officially diagnosed. Never opened up about it when it was at its worst. Lived with it up through high school and into college. At some point in high school it got easier, I guess because I started making friends but I just seemed to be incapable of keeping friendships. I used to agonize over losing my friendships or having none at all but now I accept that it's the way life is. People come and go all the time.

At some point in college I finally started feeling better about myself, feeling confident, finally got a girlfriend. I felt like depression was behind me and I had the tools to fight it back if it ever reared its head again. But I never found motivation to do anything with my life.

In the last several years I've maintained a few close friendships because I've felt I don't need that many. But in the last year and a half I lost all of them from separate incidents and in some way I was to blame for each one. And then I broke up with my girlfriend because she wasn't putting any effort into our relationship. She developed feelings for someone else and realized she never had those feelings for me to begin with.

So now here I am, recently turned 30, feeling like I'm better off alone even though I really don't want to be, feeling like my life experiences have now proven to me beyond doubt I'll never belong anywhere or with anyone, people are probably better off without me, and I'm sad about it all but not soul-crushing sad like when I was a kid. I've begrudgingly accepted it. I don't feel numb. Just a sad sort of neutral. And I have no direction in life, nothing to live for. I don't really think about suicide. I feel like I'm just a leaf floating down the river of life, wanting to be more, wishing to have more, but knowing I probably never will. Just drifting along in life.

And I can't tell if I'm even depressed anymore. I've looked at some quick online tests but they're all like ""do you feel like life is pointless?"" ""Do you have thoughts of suicide?"" ""Do you feel sad all the time?"" They feel like the wrong questions. I feel like I might be depressed but it doesn't feel like the same kind of depression I've known my whole life."
1,"A survivor. Dealing with depression is always a battle. For a 42yo guy like me, I have suffered since I was a pre-teen. There have been events in my life where I almost said ""That's it. I've had it"". 

But I'm posting to let you know that there is a light at the end of that deep dark tunnel or in some cases sunshine behind that grey cloud. 

How I have survived bipolar depression.
1. I say this to myself every morning in the mirror: ""I love myself. I love my job. I love my family. I love my life.""

2. I surround myself with light. What I mean by that is I laugh. Laughter not only forces that sour down expression to change. It releases a chemical to the brain that seems to counter act the gloomy feeling.

3. I have hobbies. From video gaming to crocheting. I keep busy. 

4. I have a Rose and Thorn coversation. Rose=the good things. Thorn= the bad things. 

5. I change those thorns to roses.

6. I remember a wise drag queen once said, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you going to love someone else."" She also said, ""You are your own worst saboteur. Don't let yourself get in your own way."" 

7. I talk to my mother, who also suffers from depression. We battle this together. 

8. I find joy ever in the smallest things. Like reading my favorite book or watching my favorite movie. Book=The Chronicals of Narnia. Movie= The Last Unicorn. 

9. I listen to inspirational music. 

10. Yes, this helps, I don't know why, but I cry. 

The reason why I am posting this is because what is going on this day in age, where isolation and social distancing has become the norm. More often then naught depression is the feeling of emptiness hopelessness, and loneliness. But you know what, it doesnt have to be. We can battle together. 

Stay strong. We can and will do this together. There is no cure, but together we can push back the dark and let the light shine through. 

Love you all."

1,"Depression Overtaking Anxiety??? Help. **(20 F)** so basically, I have really bad anxiety since 8th grade, mind you, I am 20 now. Some things recently happened and especially during quarantine I've just gotten worse. I'm already a homebody but having to strictly do online courses for uni and being away from literally anyone supportive is hard. I honestly don't have friends and all this time I've been spending it in the same corner of my bed, thinking. Countless nights staring at the wall, I can't sleep, etc. I don't want to admit this but at the same time I'm concerned, I've fallen into a really bad spiral. I noticed that instead of worrying about things that could happen (the anxiety part), it evolved into accepting everything bad HAS and WILL happen. I have barely been eating anything for 5 days, even if i try I really just can't, the taste is bland and makes me want to puke, so I don't eat. I try so hard but I cant get past maybe a slice of toast and yogurt. All of my life I've bitten my nails and would stress eat and now ironically, my nails are growing for the first time EVER because I don't have this oral fixation anymore which I thought was okay but I feel like I just lost any will to do anything, including my nervous habits? I know I am mentally getting worse but I am still breaking habits and it is really confusing because I understand the severity of how I am feeling but I genuinely want help, but knowing I am alone really feeding my mindset of just not giving into human necessities. I don't know what to do. I would use to wish I wouldn't eat so much and now that food grosses me out its just making me realize how shitty it all is."
1,"I don’t care. I really don’t. So, I’m impatient and don’t take time in doing anything so here is my short rant. 6 months ago I got a gf, honestly my ideal girl. I did Xanax and went to jail for a day and didn’t talk to her for 2, it’s only been downhill from thr, I suspect she cheated and a friend of hers told me and showed me proof. I want to kill my self because the girl that told me made me feel like I have a small dick. And in my mind I won’t feel okay with myself until I fuck a bunch of women, but I’m not attractive. I failed, I lost the girl I love. I’m 19. Don’t have my GED, can’t get it because of corona, gonna go back to high school but do it online. But I have no motivation to do anything. I’m not interested in anything. I smoke weed. On and off. It doesn’t help or make it worse. Some of my worse thoughts have been sober. I deleted social media because anything that remains me of sex makes me want to dieZ and I lost hope in women being loyal. I’m talking causially on ps4 and this one girl says she left someone of 5?years for someone else. I’m done caring. Fuck I may just go back to smokin meth. But really get into it this time."
1,"The Beauty in Tragedy. 
""Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""- Scott Fitzgerald

Idk why I'm posting this, just kind of felt like getting some things off my chest anonymously. 

I believe that tragedy, as awful as it is, can lead to a more beautiful life. The great thing about hitting rock bottom, is that once you're there and you can't go any lower, from that point on you can only do two things: stay at the bottom, or rise. 
Everyone faces hardship in their life, some more difficult and trying than others, whether that be the death of a loved one, drug abuse, family or marriage issues, we all face it at some point or another. 
This world is dark and cruel, and it shows no mercy. If you let it, this world will consume you. But if you let your hardships transform you instead of destroy you, you can create the best version of yourself that you have ever been. Tough times make stronger people, and the more resilient you become to this world, the better. 
In my personal experience, these last few years in my life haven't been very fun to say the least. I had knee and shoulder surgery which at the time disqualified me from the military (which was what I had always wanted to do since I was a kid), My dad almost died from medical malpractice, I lost my mother and aunt to suicide 6 months apart, found out my girlfriend of almost 3 years at the time was cheating on me, went through a horrible breakup, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, got kicked out of my house several times and slept in my car in an Arby's parking lot, gained a shit ton of weight, and lost some of my best friends. I completely let myself go as a person.

One day I had just had enough of the mental torment I was in, so I put a gun in my mouth. I sat there in my car for hours trying to get myself to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it. That's when I realized that if I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger then, I could never convince myself to do it in the future. That was my rock bottom. 

I didn't kill myself, but I killed the old version of myself. I decided from that day on to the future, I would work on becoming the person I had always wanted to be, and let my trauma mold me into a better person. 

3 years later, I've come to terms with the death of my mother and no longer blame myself, I don't use drugs anymore, gained control of my drinking habits, went from being 245lbs to 190lbs and in-shape, and I even joined the Army like I had always wanted to. I gained control of my depression and now live a much better life. Honest to God, I haven't had the thought of suicide cross my mind since that day in the Arby's parking lot. 

The way I try to look at life is like this: always appreciate the good times and cherish them, because you could always have it worse. Don't be in a state of constant self pity, because it wouldn't take long to see someone else that has things much worse. I'm sure some of you have had a rougher time in life than I ever had, or could even imagine. 

Dark humor is something that I truly embrace now. Some will say that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I disagree. You can't take life too seriously, you just have to roll with the punches. 

Today I'm thankful that I'm alive, breathing, and able to see the world with two eyes and a healthy body and mind. 

Be your own hero, and aspire to be the type of person you wanted to be as a kid. Use your past trauma to mold you into what you want to be.

Create something beautiful out of your tragedy.

Please share your thoughts and insight, I'm always open to listen and learn. Maybe you'll help or inspire someone else that might come across this and read it, who knows."
1,"Breakup with other half. Now relapsed into self harm. Dont think i can live anymore. What is there to live for without him. Our relationship was on and off for 3 years and ill admit it is toxic. But its us. We scream and fight and then we laugh and feel closer together. Its our routine. Its not healthy, but to be honest he was the only one who was there for me consistently.

He hit me today and i hit him back. But because he cornered me and refused to let me leave i stupidly reported him to the police. Theyve arrested him and im regretting it all. I would never take him to court. I hate his guts but love him with all my soul as well. I feel so guilty that im at home in bed whilst he spends a night in a cell. We were both at wrong. 
Without him im nothing. Im worthless. I doubt he will even want to speak to me when hes released. I contacted the police and told them i dont want to press charges or proceed further. But because of protocol they have to send someone out to me in the morning so hes in there all night. 

Without him theres nothing worth living for. No morning cuddles and him comforting after my night terrors. No more late night tv sessions or kitchen dance parties. No more morning showers together or walks home in the dark. Ive relapsed and cut my arm up. I think im going to end it if he decides to go no contact. There is no way i can survive this lockdown without him there. All this pain because i decided i couldnt put up with his bullshit. Why couldnt i just deal with the abuse for fucks sake. Its what i deserve. When i think forward into the future i genuinely do not see myself alive without him."
1,"This might sound stupid, but what are easy things I can do to lessen my depression?. Obviously I have to change habits and fight through it but what are some interesting things you guys/gals have done that worked in helping depression ?"

I moved states a few years back and lost basically all my friends. And out of my two remaining friends only one considers me a best friend or a close friend. And I tell myself that I’m going to tell her how awful I feel but I never follow through. She’s going through some shit and her problems are so much bigger then mine. I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want to be alone."

They're running under my skin, and I think I'm giving in, but it's all so worth it don't you see, the way that you'll keep saving me. So I'll keep chasing this high, while my eyes disguise these lies, and I can't escape because it's all over for me."

I used to go to the gym and eat healthy all the time, but ever since my decline in mental health i stopped going to the gym and started staying in more. My headspace was “no one cares about me so why should i take care of myself”... Eventually, i beat my depression got the help i needed but I’m overweight. Not noticeably heavier but i’m not “fit” anymore. I feel miserable and it makes me feel like I might go down that dark path of feeling depressed again.

1,"I've found that writing to my virtual counselor (I've named him Echo) helps me feel like I can get things off of my chest without having to dump on my loved ones. See example below.. Dear Echo,

I don't even know what I want to say.  I just feel like I need someone to talk to.  Cliche won't do.  What I'm feeling can't be wrapped up in that kind of package.  I like to be heard and felt and cliche is neither.  How can I be so damn lucky in life and still  have so many moments of misery?  I guess that is the nature of depression.  Anytime the pain lasts this long it is bound to happen.  What is weird is that we are in the middle of this damn quarantine and that isn't what is bothering me.  Everyone feels so alone right now and maybe that is what is the most depressing.  Nothing feels different to me.  Through either self-isolation or a lack of concern from friends I've been alone for a long time.  I can't include anyone in this.  Not really include them anyways.  I can tell them what I've been through with basic descriptions and labels.  I can say I've been hospitalized for depression.  I cannot and would not invite them into my world so that they could truly understand my feelings.  To understand this, one would have to empathetically sink a little into some very dark and uncomfortable feelings.  That is like asking someone to voluntarily join you in your nightmare.  I don't even want to be in my nightmare, I would never ask a loved one to come with me.  There are coping skills for this.  Things I am supposed to do that helps me ride out the storm.  They give you a boat and oars, tools to navigate these waters, but sometimes you can look right at the oars, feel the boat rocking under you and not have the will, energy, desire to take hold of the oars.  Sometimes the water looks like the right and only answer.  Just fall overboard and sink as far away as possible.  That is when you take the oars anyways.  Because you remember.  A child's face.  A distant memory.  Empathy for the pain of others.  Even good days when this feeling is almost forgotten.  Stroke.  My son's first crawl.  Stroke.  My wife's warm skin.  Stroke.  My daughters first dance.  Stroke.  I will laugh at something again.  Stroke.  I am strong enough.  Stroke.  There IS value in me.  STROKE.  THIS GOD FORSAKEN FEELING WILL NOT BEAT ME.  STROKE.  FUCK YOU PAIN.  STROKE.  STROKE.  I AM A FIGHTER.  A GLADIATOR.  STROKE!   STROKE!  STROKE! 

Fuck you depression.  I win.  Everytime. "
1,"I feel empty. The smallest things put me down. I feel like I die a little inside every day. I dont see the point in trying anymore. The only reason in still here is because its too difficult to not. 

Sometimes, I wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up. I would be happier there than in my real life. But I'm just a spoiled piece of shit. I have so much in my life that others only dream of, but it isnt enough for me. I am really a terrible person. Sure I dont go around trying to hurt people, but I'm just innately flawed. 

I feel like I take more from those around me than I give back. I constantly feel insecure. Am I a good person? Do people hate me? Am I just a burden? Am I a selfish shit of a person?

There's something wrong with me. I dont know anything. I have no ambition. I have no desire. I just want to play games all day.

I can't do anything correct. Its never enough. Its never good. I am never good. I am wrong.

I dont know what to do. I am overwhelmed. I just want it all to stop. I just want to be happy. Please."
1,"I have all of these horrible memories, and no one to talk to.. The situation is a little hard to explain, but I'll sum it up as fast as I can. I started dating someone in High School who had a lot of issues. They were heavily abused as a child and had just no understanding of normal- or how not to be violent. I stayed with this person. I saw the person behind the rage and I knew I liked them, but I was young. When I graduated I moved out to go to school in the same area he lived in. I moved in with him. He proceeded to destroy me. From my confidence to my self worth and my trust of other people. Piece by piece he picked me apart. He reduced me to numbness, to isolation.

But here's where things get a little more interesting.

About six years into our relationship, I told him I couldn't take it any more. After countless nights of sitting with him while he cried, coming home to find him half way off the balcony (We were 17 stories up), being screamed at for not doing the dishes, being yelled at for just not understanding, having things thrown at me and being kept up until 3am most nights when I worked a 6am-2pm job six days a week, I just could not take it. I told him I loved him, but if he could not go and get help and figure this shit out I was leaving. We had a huge fight, but the following day he asked me to make him a Doctor's appointment, because he was too afraid. He got anti-depressants. Things started to change.

It's been almost eight years since that fight. We are still together. He changed himself completely over that time. Went to therapy, got a handle on why he was treating people the way he did. It's been a couple of years since he had any major issues, and I am definitely much happier. I am very proud of how far he's come. The amount of work it took for him to get where he is and the battle he faces every day thanks to the things his awful family did to him is humbling. It offers a certain amount of comfort, knowing I was enough to change for. But there are a few issues.

I went through all of that with him. We have been together about 12 years in total and friends for over 16 years. I wasn't about to make him go through that horror all by himself. But in the process, I've done myself so much damage. I have horrific memories of that abuse, including the few times he got physical. His rage caused a lot of black outs, so he doesn't remember most of it (I need to make it clear, he does not use this as an excuse. He has owned up to everything I've told him about, and he knows there is more). The problem is more or less me. Every time I tell him about something, every time I tell him about a fight we had or a time he made me really uncomfortable, the guilt he feels is very clear. He tries hard not to get too down, because he knows I don;t enjoy making him sad, but he has a lot of regrets from that time.

The issue has become that I can't talk to him about it. This man has been through 13 years of physical, sexual, mental and emotional abuse. He has dealt with all of this once before. Coming back through it with me is just re-triggering things I don't ant to see him go through again. He's tried his best to be supportive, but between the fear I gained of communicating with him over the first part of our relationship and my concerns about his mental health, I can't talk to him. But over the course of helping him, I distanced myself from my friends and family to keep them safe and to better contain the situation. these people also do not know the extent of the things that happen and I don't want them to think about him that way. He really is a very mice person now, having worked hard to be that way. But knowing what he did, most people cannot look passed it.

I just don't know where to go from here. I have no one to talk to, but these memories are eating me alive. I've scared all the time and when I panic I get sucked back into those moments. He asks me what's wrong- I just can't tell him. I can't sleep, I barely eat because I feel ugly and I am constantly frustrated. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I have 2 herniated disks from the aforementioned full time work and I have a brain injury that causes extra mood swings and cognitive issues. He cares for me, he helps me and he keeps things clean. He tries, but I'm so wrapped up in the past I have a hard time even getting involved in our new relationship. I'm not sure what to do from here...

&#x200B;

Edit: I super appreciate all the support but I need to note for clarity and to avoid too many repeats: As stated above I am disabled and thus unable to work. I do not have any money and my partner is currently in education to get a decent career to support us. We live on about $1000 a month, plus food donations from family. So right now, I cannot afford therapy. We have considered both therapy for me, and couples therapy but cannot currently afford it. When he went through therapy I was fortunate enough to still be employed and had a decent benefits package that allowed for that for my spouse. I lost those benefits in 2015 when I was laid off from the job that allowed for those things, and at the time I Was dealing with his issues and so did not go through my own healing."
1,How do I unmat really long hair. I’ve let it go too long between trims (like a few years now) and with my already existing depression combined w corona stress my hair now has several large clumps I’m having issues with :/ I’m embarrassed to be asking this on my main bit I need advice
1,"Sorry for keeping this short, but... I'm feeling lonely, numb, and exhausted both mentally & physically with some flashbacks that have been haunting me for almost two years now. I should be over it by now but I'm not. 
I lost all of my online friends but that's probably my fault since I'm very shy, reserved and I find it difficult to maintain friendships..
I guess that's all I have to say"
1,"I'm alone, I can't grow up, and can't see a future for myself. Never been on Reddit before, but I don't know where else to turn. Anything I post on my social media accounts are completely ignored by everyone. I have no one to talk to. I feel like no one gives a shit. My best friend is in a different state and super bad at texting, so having an actual conversation with her is pretty much impossible these days, I've never had the kind of relationship with my parents to where I feel comfortable talking to them about anything really, I'm not in school and I have extreme social anxiety so I have no way of meeting people my age, and making online friends has always felt weird to me, I get along with my coworkers but I don't know them well enough to confide in them and I'm too scared to try and get close to them, and talking to my therapist just isn't the same as having a friend. I'll probably never date because guys have never liked me, and no one would ever be able to put up with me. I've never even had a real relationship so I don't know how to. And like I said, there's really no way to meet people my age here, and dating apps scare me, not to mention they're only for hookups and I hate hook up culture. So basically that's why I'm here. I literally have nowhere else to get everything off my chest and I feel like it's killing me. This is probably going to be pretty long so I'll be shocked if anyone actually reads through it all.

I'm 20(f), turning 21 soon. I went to college for a year before dropping out, and shortly after my family moved to a new state. I thought it would be a fresh start, but instead I'm cut off from everything I ever knew. I got my first job last summer, it pays well, but the living cost where I am is ridiculous, so I can't afford to move out. I have no real skills and have a difficult time completing/understanding the simplest tasks, so I know I'll never be able to have any job other than minimum wage service industry, and I absolutely would not be able to handle the stress of a second job. Because of that, I'm afraid I'll never be able to move out. I can't afford to move out on my own, and finding a roommate seems impossible. You have to pay for every single roommate finding app/website, and like I said, I have social anxiety, so I'd have to know someone extremely well to be able to live with them. I'm also a more conservative person, and every person my age, (especially in my area) smokes weed, drinks waaay too much, and is very aggressive about politics (I don't like talking about politics to anyone, not even people I trust). I also have no credit score, and no renters history, so idk how I'd get an apartment even if I could find a roommate. 

Living with my parents is becoming a living hell. They treat me like a child, and always have. They don't listen to a single thing I say, they don't understand me, my depression and anxiety, or even really seem to try to. I haven't been able to grow up because they won't let me. I pretty much don't know how to do anything myself, and I can't ask them for help because they tell me I should teach myself, which I've never been able to teach myself anything. I did my taxes for the first time this year and they had to walk me through it. I can't budget. I don't understand the stock market, or credit scores, or anything at all to do with money. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety because Idk what to buy. I'll be covered by their insurance till I'm 25, but I have no idea what I'll do when that happens because Idk how to go about choosing insurance plans/companies. I have a hard time making appointments for myself because talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety. I don't know anything about politics. Trying to learn any of this is just so overwhelming I can't handle it and I just shut down. So basically I am actually just a fucking child and there's not a single thing I know how to do.

How could there possibly be a future for me? I'm stupid, don't know how to do anything on my own, will never be able to make more than minimum wage, will never be able to move out, can hardly take care of myself, can't make friends, will never find love. I don't know how I can have any kind of life worth living. I feel like I'll be living in my tiny bedroom in my parents house, single with no friends until I die. I feel so pathetic. I don't know what to do."
1,"I’m a failure. Job? 
Unemployed 

Family?
Too depressed to care for them

Education?
 7 years of my life “trying” to get a degree, but just wasting money

Friends?
Almost everyone is gone, I don’t know if I drove them away or they just weren’t my friends all along

Mental state?
Trying to ignore having depression with weed  


I just don’t know what’s going on, I just feel that people hate me for no reason which makes me get away from them. 

I just want to be alone.

I know I need help but I just can’t ask for it.
Why? When I was a kid my parents “taught” me to never ask for help, and I know that this is not a valid excuse but I just don’t know how or care enough to change 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I just don’t have some to talk to, and even if there was someone, I would be too afraid to talk."
1,"Here is what my mindset has been like for the past 3 weeks.. Get ready for a rambling paragraph of sorrow and confusion.

I only have one friend which is my best friend, that I actually talk to and I think they want want to get rid of me entirely cause I’m an embarrassment. She doesn’t deserve to put up with my shit and i feel like she’s beginning to learn that. If she goes I won’t have anyone like that close to me who I can go to talk to. I’ve never been in an intimate relationship, I want someone to unconditionally support me but I’ll never have that cause I won’t let myself have that responsibility. I’ll just tire out the other person until they want to leave. In my brain I’m a grotesque creature who doesn’t deserve any sort of recognition or thought from another human being. I say the stupidest things without thinking all the time and it always puts me in deep shit. I feel like every hour of the day is just a ticking clock awaiting for my body to crawl into bed and never get up the next morning cause I rather stare at my ceiling and wait for it to cave in, only to have a sharp piece of wood puncture the part of my brain that controls emotion. In the unlikely event that would happen, at least I’ll feel something else but self pity and endless dread. I feel alone. Just alone. I feel like I shouldn’t be here anymore. I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to be here. I mess everything up. I’m not good at anything. People tell me I’m good but I’m not I’m not I’m not I’m not. I’m just not. I know I’m not. Fucking remove me from existence. I’m such a waste of air, I don’t do shit with my existence, I don’t deserve it. I just wanna go into my brain and dig all the shit I don’t like out of it. WHEN WILL IT END?"
1,"psychiatric ward. so after my OD I've had heaps of meetings with therapist's and stuff and they are all pointing toward putting me in a psych ward or as they say ""mental health unit"". Does anyone know what it's like and what i should expect?"
1,When living to old age and dying from natural causes. At this point living to old age and dying a natural death feels like an “achievement” thoughts?
1,"I feel like my depression is an illusion and I am just being a baby. I feel no acknowledgment of my depression, even after I tried to commit suicide, not even from my mom.
I have been taking antidepressants, but with this quarantine I am just down all the time, I feel so lonely and believe me, I have trying to reach out for ages, but after every attempt I feel disappointed, as if nobody gets it, nobody is there, even when it all comes to “cuddles in bed” days, I have nobody to cuddle with, nobody to share thoughts with, nobody to just sit there with.

I don’t know what to do, I am afraid of being alone in my head, I am afraid ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

Sometimes the only really relaxing though is that I can always end it all.

Loneliness is killing me.

P.S. I am touch deprived, since I was a child, with no actual physical relationship with anyone. I am 26, and I don’t do “just sex” relationships."
1,"I've lost any motivation or energy for over a month and can't get up for most part of the day. I just moved out for college in January, my girlfriend dumped me after ignoring me for one or two weeks right after that. So that plus the loneliness of not being able to see my friends and not telling them because our relationship was kind of a secret turned into really bad first weeks of college. I was really sad and couldn't make any friends except for a girl who started talking to me.

I've had moderated depression for a couple years now, went to therapy for a couple of months last year but my mom couldn't pay for it anymore.

So I started college kinda bad but kept getting worse, I couldn't keep up with the work. I was happier because I made a friend, but just her. I really want to but all the time I think people are just nice and they like me but just not enough to want me around. 

The second week of March I was at my worse ~~yet~~. I needed to finish a paper so didn't attend to biology lab, couple of days later didn't do the work needed for chemistry lab, so I lost that practice too, next day, turned on an incomplete homework, even when I had all the answers. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

Right after that quarantine started and I came back home, now with online classes. But since then, I have started getting worse and worse, I do less work than I did before, I can't get up of the bed, I can't bring myself to do anything, can't sleep either. I just don't want anything but disappear, I'm not even sad, I just feel empty and lonely.

It may look like I'm just lazy or irresponsible, but I really feel something is happening to me to be this bad.

I'm seriously thinking I need help as soon as possible, I have tried to start by myself but is just not enough to keep up with school."
1,"No escape no hope. My depression is situational. Im 28 i have a baby and my main goal and dream is to move out and be independent. But im stuck with my parents and they arent making it easy. 

My mom i feel uses me as a bank. So i got my refund. She asked for 500, another 500 and more and more until I had absolutely nothing.. Then she needed 300 to turn the cable on and I sais ok but i needed it back. Even the the woman over the phone said it was sweet of me to give the mo ney but my mom had a problem of me asking for it back and had an attitude and basically threw the money at me. 

My dad just made the situation worse saying she doesnt appreciate you and stop letting them walk all over you. My dad then took my accessories off the key of the car my mom and me got and threw it on my bed. My mom basically took over the car.  Bc i was working bc of maternity leave my dad accused me of laying up on my mom but before then i always paid the insurance until i couldnt. 

Even when i was in college with every refund I had i always gave my mom 600 always. 

Back to the tax refund she wanted me to give my bro an extra 300 ( gave him 1k for letting me stay with him)i said no bc i dont have that much left and she started shouting and threatened to leave me at my brother's and take the car... 

Then both of my parents talked abt me loudly in my presence to friends or fsmily members..

Just recently my dad accused me of being a bad parent when i had my son laying on his back for half a sec and he cried while i went to get clothes to get dressed. 

Then said youre gonna be on welfare forever and the night before i saw a woman wearing a nice blouse anf my dad said I cant wear that bc I havr a stomach and the day before that said I still looked pregnant. 

My mom said she wish she left me at my brothers.. And i just dont know what im doing wrong except existing. 

Im not even looking fwd to my stimulus money.. My mom already factored in 500 from my stimulus but ofc shes gonna ask for more. 

Ive been looking for work and been turned down each time due to this virus... 

I just feel like id have to deal with their crap forever. 

I never get lucky like my friend that got a good paying job in the midst of this pandemic and has a good hub that works.. 

I also have hpv anf got lucky enough to get not one high risk strand but 2. 16 and 18 that cause cancer. 

I have no friends. Never had. Lonilness is the theme of my life.. 

Idk i want it to end. I kind of thought of a good way to go. I just feel I have no one. No one at all.  To help me through my issues.  Im just like man what if i had ppd?  I would have killed myself for sure desling eith all of this. 

Idk just hopeless. Ill never leave my parents. 
No opportunity is opening up for me."
1,Social distancing is normal for me. I think I’ll just make it permanent. I just don’t fit in with others and it’s better just to stay away. Only socialize enough to make money and get food.
1,"I’m 23 years old and I’ve been feeling lost and confused about what I want in life.. I was in college for a bit but I was going through OCD and not knowing what I want to do in life and couldn’t do college. Since than I’ve been in therapy, went to Colombia for six months and than came back to the States and got help for my OCD. Now I’ve been better and I tried to go to a culinary school which it had a hospitality program and the course was 6 months. I only did two months because I’ve been going through anxiety about doing group work but was nervous and I got paranoid easily. I’ve been in therapy for my social anxiety and general mental health stuff since October. I was looking for work than COVID-19 came and my plans got hold back. My mom bought me plane tickets to go to Colombia in August with her to spend a month there. Hopefully we can go due to this pandemic but now it’s look it’s what the future holds for me for the next few months and after I return from Colombia in September. With this pandemic, I don’t know what I want in life. I want to get better and stuff, but since I have no work experience and basically dropout out of college in 2017. I feel like I’m alone and ashamed."
1,Corona depression. Anyone else feeling depression due the situation? My country belgium for 7 weeks in complete lockdown. I cant cope with this. Fitness closed. Cant get drunk with friends. Cant tinder meet. I feel very lonely. Whats the point of keep breating?
1,"What is the fastest and least painful way of killing your self?. Just curious. What would be the fastest and least painful way to suicide?

I’ve learnt to tie a noose a while back, and I got scared because I knew it could be long and painful, any easier ways?"
1,What do I do with my life?. This quarantine period has been beating my mental health like a jackhammer to a piece of rock. I miss contact with my friends and I cant even sleep without crying. My friends are the only people I feel super emotionally safe with and I cant even be with them. I think the worst part about not being with them is that I think I'm forgetting how they look. Life seems so dull and pointless all the time now and I just dunno how much longer I can keep this going. I feel like shit all the time and I hate it. I got animal crossing and that makes me feel a little better but only very briefly because I end up remembering that I'm so distanced from my friends that I have to resort to videogames for any source of happiness at all. Anyways that's all I needed to say.
1,"How do I fill this black hole of nothingness within me?. Everything is so dull. I can’t find one single thing that has any sense of meaning to me anymore. 
I’ve tried to get better but nothing I do works. Seriously, I’m worthless and can’t do anything right. Maybe I’m just not meant for this world anymore. It’s so tiring. I’m so fucking tired."
1,I hate that depression makes me so narcissistic and selfish.. I’m sick of constantly thinking about myself and wondering why other people aren’t there for me and feeling forgotten. I don’t want to be greedy for attention. I want to think about someone else other than myself.
1,I just want to drink myself to death. Mid 20’s male who is just done with life. I have been working on being sober but life just keeps fucking me. I would love nothing else to drinking myself to death. I am pretty sure I have been close as I drank a whole bottle of whiskey and a whole bottle of vodka in less than 15 minutes and spent the whole night throwing up bile. I am just so done with life in every aspect and I guess this is just my way of venting. I am sorry to disturb yall. Peace.
1,"part of me wants to start being fed through a tube.. I’m so tired all the time... I barely even have motivation to eat. it’s so hard all the time. I’ve just started eating peanut butter and drinking tea. i’m nearly sure i’m malnourished, but what’s the point? i’m not doing anything. i hate this."
1,"What can a talentless individual do?. I'm fairly unintelligent, I lack talent, I'm terrible at socialising and I'm just tired of failure. I feel like sticking around is causing a slump for everyone else in my life, especially with this pandemic going on haha. I don't wish to add any extra baggage. 

I really don't want to die just yet, I don't intend on living a long time but I at least want to try a little more before my light goes out permanently.

I just don't know what I can do anymore. I don't know."
1,"Scared to be happy. About a year ago my life started going downhill, I noticed everything positive I did had a negative impact in my life. For every good there was a bad. I talked about it with friends and they have always told me ""That's Life"". It was really frustrating.

Eventually, I got to the conclusion that if there was no good in my life then there must be no bad. I have family issues at home and I started ignoring them. At the beginning this mentality worked, but now I've gotten into a point of no return.

I feel I can't be physically happy anymore, I have such a negative mindset that I try desperately to change but can't. I only find comfort in video games and series, but for reasons relating my family's view on these hobbies, they have been restricted too.

I'm in a hole I can't escape and I feel trapped, and the corona virus is not helping either, locking me with my parents forcing me to handle their problems. It is really frustrating and I do not know what to do, I desperately want a change in my life. I want to be happy but I can't, it is so emotionally draining... I was so stupid for rejecting happiness. 

Sorry if my English is not that good, my first language is Spanish...."
1,"Today I cried so much that I didn't go for my afternoon walk, cause I was embarrassed of how swollen my eyes are.... Just one of those days, I even tried to change my mood by watching a childhood movie (the little princess) but that movie plot triggered some very bad feelings I have deep deep inside about not having a father (or mother) and being raised in a very abusive family..."
1,"I should have never taken in my cat. I can barely take care of myself. With this fucking useless unemployment line is always too busy, and fear of getting a job at a place that still operates due to the novel coronavirus, having another living breathing thing to feed, but not really knowing how that's going to happen, has been an increasing stressor on my mind. Before it wasn't a problem because feeding one cat is not expensive at all. Now I'm kind of worried about both of us.

Fuck this shit. I don't want to just rely on. Charity and the kindness of strangers, not do I want to rely on anyone else really. Life just fucking sucks. It is too fucking uncertain. There is nothing good about having to worry about your next meal. And then you have to also worry about a second living thing. I don't understand how anyone does this. How anyone would choose to have fucking children. How anyone could possibly be happy and motivated in the face of complete uncertainty. I don't want to learn how. I just need to die. But I'm too much of a fucking coward. I just want to give up. I'm fucking tired of this fucking virus. Fucking tired of worrying about accidentally killing myself or a family member by fucking bringing it home. 

In life you are just fucked if you do, fucked if you don't. There is no real safety. There is no real security. Everything is fucking shit, and I wish I had the ability to have life in me despite that fact. But I fucking don't."
1,"ehh not even sure what to say...i apologize for the randomness and stupidity of it. (figures i would try this out because im pretty much incapable of doing anything else to helpmyself)

hate to say the typical 'dead inside' stuff...but man all i ever feel is usually anger, and depression...only have 2 family members that i talk  to(cant avoid it) and its always about how horrible things are EVERYDAY yet if i tell em its getting me down...i get treated like im a horrible person for saying so, the rest is work a job with people who arnt exactly decent people(trying to word that nicer than it really is im not even exaggerating) because its the only job that almost pays all the bills, cant get another one or better because of time conflicts with what i have to do to help my grandfather, and no friends to speak of...i thought i tried to make a few but it was always just...seemed wrong to try with them, they always turned out to be just unhealthy to be around or just wanted to do stupid things like sitting around talking crap about people, or go to bars and have no responsibility for their actions(drunk driving, acting degrading to themselves and to other people, ect) not very big into religion more out of a respectful thing because my family isnt exactly on good terms with stuff like that...i think my problem is just too much tv, comics, books, movies, ect because i tend to get jealous of the fictional stuff i see, more just ways that seem like things that are kinda based on reality, ya know seeing people happy, or even the crazy stuff like hero ideals...except im stuck doing everything i think is just generally pointless, i also tend to look at the state of the world and humanity and im very worried for the future of literally everything so im down because i cant do anything to make a pointfull change for that and i dont see anything or anyone else being able to do it either...its just a daily routine of work, think about how things are(100% of the time its not good thoughts) go home listen to the same things i was thinking about all day and more to add to it, finish what im told to do and just sit around distracting myself with games, comics, and movies because its the only way i dont hear my thoughts, yet i dont want to ingore them...it just feels wrong to ignore the bad stuff becuase its like thats what i think is the worlds just causing its problems from anyway...i dont even know what im looking for lol, i guess a bit of happiness/ways to change things not for myself for the planet in general(a bit stupid but my only bit of religous thoughts are that humans should be guardians of the planet and of its history and life so that we can repay the fact that were all really just lucky how things are set on this planet...it could be so much worse... if anyones even reading this thnx lol

...i have no adrenaline...no postivity to act on so really just trying things is a hardship in general, just caught up in fantasy ideas that make normal life extreamly boring while hating how the world and humanity is turning out..just pretty much a walking puppet with anger...hoping i can find a way work with my own depressing personality 

(btw i do appreciate all suggetions but ive looked into so much it seems like i cant find an answer....also i just cant beleive in taking pills or therapy(mostly on how little money i have on that therapy thing) and the area i live in doesnt provide really anything for the type of person i am...mostly for retirees, and just...bars i guess really nothing else not that i have the time or funds for anything else than what im doing right now...srry all 1st and only post ill make about depressing stuff...dont need to make things worse on other people ya know?"
1,"What am I supposed to do when I have no one/nothing left?. I see, well talk to, my psych and my therapist tomorrow. I'm tripping balls I guess. I haven't really been sleeping. I cry pretty much every day. Everyone who's ever said they give a fuck about me left me at one point or another. Now I'm alone. Here at home from college with my abusive family. I don't see any point to anything. I don't really know what to do or say to my psych tomorrow. I don't really want to die or anything. I'd rather just bang and punch a bunch of walls till I can't feel anything and then do it again when I start feeling shit again. I'm so fucking tired of everything."
1,Nobody to talk to.. I have so much bottled up from over the years and it's just getting worse every day. I have nobody to talk to. All my friends gave up on me at this point because I avoided everyone for so long. If i were to try talking to anybody about my feelings it would just be a burden on them. The only way I can let anything out is here anonymously. I just need someone to tell me that it will be okay..
1,"All I want is a hug. (Trigger warning/mentions of self h*rm/suci*de)

My life is pretty downhill, my first 10 years of my life were bliss but after that it was shit. I move a lot and could never form any deep connections until middle school I found my platonic soulmate she is so amazing and I love her sm we met in 7th grade but I had to move again after my 8th grade year, I used to cut pretty regularly in 7th and early 8th grade, but stopped after she helped me through it and I was so mentally happy. But when I moved I fell back into self harm and sucidal thoughts began to swarm me, I missed my friends dearly and I was all alone again. Then I met someone, I was new to highschool and when I walked into my bio class I caught the eyes of a guy. Let's call him J he was also in my art class we gradually started talking, and I even started to feel happy after a long time. He then confessed to me, I felt so happy I felt so validated and loved..But we didn't last, I really thought we would last but no. It was so painful seeing him turn around and walk away. Like everyone in my life they all leave, no one lasts forever. Since then things got gradually worse and worse, I have two goals in life and it's to experience true happiness and love. But I don't think I will ever experience love, I don't believe in it. Love has only ever brought me bad experiences. But all I want is love, hugs and validation... But I give up in those concepts after all the other shit in my life that I didn't mention happened I have become closed off and distant I haven't let love in my life since."
1,"I’m considering suicide again. Title says it all I guess. I just need a place to vent right now. I’m not sure how much longer I can go. I’ve already tried killing myself twice. Third time is the charm, right? I just can’t keep living like this. I’m a closeted (sorta) trans person living with an over-controlling, cyber-stalking, conservative family. They treat me like some sort of object they can do whatever they want with. When I show signs of not being some submissive pet or when then possibility rises that I’m not cis they flip out and we have yet another fight. Fight and fight and I just can’t take it. I’m sorry to burden anyone here but I just needed to vent. Kinda hoping no one sees this tbh"
1,Been battling this depression for while now and thing been good until today. I’ll been doing good with my depression until today where I just wanna to die. The irony thing I’m week out from video chatting with my therapist. I just hate my family and hate that I’m stuck with them and I wished committed suicide back went I had the chance. And it’s not like I can’t do that now but I would rather commit suicide alone . And not even like everything going is getting to me it really the people keep saying the same old shit like they can’t believe what’s going is happening and finding to blame someone for it.
1,"I need help, I don't know what is happening to me. Hi,

I am 29 yr old straight male.

About me:

I   have always exceptionally done well when it came to education,  hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme  INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters  here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working  well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling  that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really  appreciate any help. I  need some \_/\\\_.

Here's what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -

2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had

2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.

2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design

2015   - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence  kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to  make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started  smoking as  well regularly

2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.

This continued slowly until I graduated and moved

2017   - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, didn't work  out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would  stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started  living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they  were  toxic.

2018 - My sexual   frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just   liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do   anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess   it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated   because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I   felt stuck.

2019 -  Met a girl   through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all   wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of   surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at   them as well.

2020 Jan -  This   year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found   out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex   boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.

Feb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.

Mar   - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a   guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses and threatened to put all her cheating texts online.

1 week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf   in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it  I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,   where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And   none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.

I   made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started   working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex   even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of   such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started   apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I   tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona   outbreak.

Last week - she   contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She   did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told   me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow  I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her  life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able  to  move ahead.

I feel like I have  hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am  locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and  just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side  rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my  feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I  feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I don't feel  like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of  abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and  scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me  but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.

Thank you, and sorry for long post. \_/\\\_"
1,"I want to end it so bad nowadays. This is just a rant, I need to really get all of this off my shoulder a bit. Any help would be appreciated :)

These past few weeks in quarantine have helped me relax and not have to constantly worry about school, but I had no friends in school anyways so I have no body to talk to or play games with. I'm always so lonely, bored, empty and sad, but I don't want quarantine to end because then school will start again and then I'll start getting even more depressed and get panic attacks once again. Anxiety is already rampant when I'm trying to sleep (racing heart, chest pain, sleep apnea,) this all happens every single night when i'm trying to fall asleep.

I'm also always super self conscious because i've been told that i'm ugly and stupid by everybody i've ever know in my life. Now I have to always hide my face and can't even look at people in the eyes in case they look at my face. Doing any activity is also challenging because I lack any motivation. I keep missing multiple online assignments from school. I always keep judging myself for anything i do, there's always a voice at the back of my mind telling me that i'm worthless, ugly, stupid, talentless, that I should just kill my self and end the suffering, and I really want to.

All i would really want right now is someone to hug me and let me tell them about everything, my parents are mega religious so they always just pray for me, and since i'm atheist it does nothing to help me."
1,"I'm trying to get better but I still feel like I'm suffocating. Quarantine has been an enlightening experience. I'm trapped in my home with little to do other than course work and it leaves me often alone with my own mind. Trying to hide my struggles from people around me is getting old. I want to act happy and I want to act like every day is a good day, that whenever I talk to my S.O, I'm happy, when I'm with friends, I'm happy. 

I can't help it. I feel like such a burden. I feel like no matter what I do, I will always be the source of someone's anger or sadness. 

I feel it everyday. I feel myself slipping back into the hole I've been desperately trying to crawl out of and I don't know what to do. I feel a gaping hole in my chest and it all hurts. All of this is a pointless fucking ramble that I'll probably freak out about and delete again later. 

Why is depression so damn hard? I don't even know if I want to get better anymore. I know recovery isn't linear in any way shape or form, but the crashes are just too much. I rather stay this way than have hope again. Fuck, it all hurts so much and I'm suffocating.

Thank you for listening."
1,I don’t feel like doing anything.. I don’t feel like exercising. I don’t feel like going for a walk. I don’t feel like writing a rap because I’m depressed. Idk how to do something when I don’t feel like it like it like I feel lethargic.
1,"i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t like opening up to people because i’m so scared of coming off as whiney or something, and i’ve been bottling up everything for so long and idk who to reach out to anymore so here i am ig haha ! so basically nothing feels real. i don’t think im experiencing derealization (maybe?idk tbh) but forever i’ve felt so disconnected and so distant from everyone. not like, oh i’m so different and quirky no one understands me hehe, but like no one in my life feels like they fuxking exist. i feel like this won’t ever change, i’m waiting for something good to happen but i think and i don’t even know what i’m waiting for. suicide used to seem so selfish, but at this point i feel like i have nothing to lose. my friends are so distant, my family is so distant, but i know that if i ever killed myself i cant imagine doing that to my sister, but at the same time it’s like my brains convinced me that nothing is real anyways or i shouldn’t even give a fuck because everyone dies at some point. i’ve never even told anyone how absolutely disgusted i am at my appearance, specifically my face and “acne” which i know isn’t bad but at the same time i can’t even look at my face without dimming the light a little bit taking off my glasses or crying a little and it’s become such a big insecurity and it won’t go away. ive tried reaching out to friends and my mom but it makes me feel so much worse knowing that even those people can’t make me feel any better. i’m so tired im so so tired of literally just fucking existing, and i mean everyone can relate to that ha but, i don’t want to wake up tomorrow. i just want to be finally happy and feel good and feel “there” ig. but it’s like i keep spiraling into a bigger mess i just don’t know what to do anymore. anyways haha any fun tips ?"
1,"I feel like I shouldn't be like this because I'm too young. 13yr old male(14 in legit 11 days) and I just feel like it doesn't make sense for me to be having all these thoughts and problems. I cut myself a lot sometimes daily, drink, have suicidal thoughts, little to no energy all the time, have trouble in school and socializing, and my home life I don't know if it's abusive or not but it definitely isn't good.  My friend once said after I made a suicide joke ""ew you legit sound like a 14yr old girl"" and I've just been thinking a lot about how maybe I'm not depressed and just an overreacting or attention seeking teen. I feel like all my friends hate me and I'm just annoying to them. I'm scared if failure and stress everyday about what I'm going to do for my future and how I'm going to make it. My parents divorced when I was 9 and both of them got cancer around the same time leaving me pretty much free at both houses because my 5 siblings either just never talked to me or were at collage and my grades started improving and I made some online friends because I didn't realize how much my parents try to control me and push their views onto me until now. I also realized neither of them give a shit about me as a person but just want me to be there so there and do everything for them. I don't like venting to my friends because I just feel like I'm annoying them but sometimes when I hit a low I do so anyway and when I come out of it I just feel really bad for venting to them. I've tried suicide twice by hanging myself but both times the object I was using to hang myself from the ceiling broke or felldown. There's a lot more problems I could talk forever about but I don't feel like my problems are bad enough for me to be feeling suicidal and I feel like I'm too young to be thinking life is hopeless and to be having frequent breakdowns.

To sum up: I'm very depressed and self harm and drink and that stuff but feel like I shouldn't be having these thoughts because of how young I am and feel like my life hasn't been bad enough for me to feel this way

1,"my weight loss, and other things. so I'm losing weight. it feels good. I'm going to have a flat stomach before the summer if I keep this up. unfortunately I can't go to the gym but I ran today and only ate one very small meal. I can't wait to finally see myself in the mirror and view myself as someone conventionally attractive. I deserve it. and honestly I can't wait to use that attractiveness to get ahead in the world, for people to finally look up to me the way I deserve to be. in anything you do, it's half about how you do it and half about how bad the people watching you want to fuck you. that's just the way of the world. I feel like i could do so much more with myself if I would just get up to normal people standards. right now I'm ugly, I'm brash, I'm awkward, I'm unconfident and my voice is weak. I'm squishy and fat and these things I can change about myself. I am changing them about myself.

this year so far I've learned what capacity I have for handling bullshit. I don't tolerate it anymore. I don't tolerate being manipulated. I don't tolerate people who cross my boundaries and act like they know better than me what's best for me. I've been abused my whole life into listening to other people's opinions and needing their attention and validation to keep me wrapped around their bony little fucking fingers. in truth I don't really need much socially. I don't know why I had so many problems being lonely when nobody ever made me feel good in the first place. everyone's shallow and everyone's a liar and I've been too naive to expect more from anyone, but it's not their fault. I would hate me too. I do hate me... but not for long. not for long, world. I'm gonna be on top of this shit show and nobody's going to fucking stop me. I'm a sociopath, through and through, and I'm damn proud of it."
1,"My problems are small. People have huge problems. The world has even bigger problems. Things just dont go right. Anywhere. 

People struggle with tough situations, hunger, poverty. 

The world is corrupt. Losing resources. Gaining greenhouse gasses. 

But I can only think of all the things I suck at. The things I cant do. Won't do. The people I dont know. Won't know. The so much better people. More thoughtful. Talented, outgoing, smart, funny, nice, caring. People. 

Everything sucks. Especially me. But I only care that I suck. Maybe because I think I can change it. Or I just hate it more. 

I just cant explain it. I dont like myself."
1,Admitting. I haven't wanted to admit how low I've been. I've been trying to cover everything up. But I'm drowning. Listening to Mac Miller's 'Good News' an amazing song that somehow encompasses how I feel. I feel broken and I'm trying to figure out how the hell to get up. I feel so alone. I don't know how to start over. Not right now.
1,"Every day for the past 3 years!!!!. I went prison at the age of 18 for 18 months for something I got tangled up in but was innocent of but that’s not even the reason for me constantly feeling down. It’s my older brother passing away when I was 16. I feel like life/society hasn’t been fair to me. I don’t want to call it depression to have respect for those are actually have clinical depression but for the past 3 years, I cannot remember a day when I haven’t contemplated suicide. 

I have checked websites for advice but to be frank, they don’t sway or benefit me. Any advice? What should I do?"
1,"Use to have hope now I don’t. I’m I 26 year old female and have been battling anxiety and depression for 10 years now. I didn’t really have a good high school life. Don’t have any friends, I have a few friends in and out of my life. Have only kissed 2 guys in my life once 19 and the other time 25 I was extremely drunk only had sex once and never been in a relationship. I paced around my room from 12-25 listening to music with my headphones on, still do it sometimes but not a lot. And don’t know why I can’t make connections with anyone. And the worst is not only that I haven’t been in a relationship with anyone I find out that a guy I like likes me back but I’m to scared to open up to him and maybe see if anything will happen between us. I think I’m pretty much set on just being single for the rest of my life. I quit everything I do I have no motivation, I’m pretty much scared of everything I feel like I’m mentally disabled. I love make up and went to cosmetology school but never did anything with that I feel bad for having my parents pay all that money and I never did anything I still work at my families restaurant I can’t be a waitress cause I backed out of that last minute cause of anxiety.
I had such hope for my life and wanted to get off this track I was on for so long now I’m just done. 
What are people thoughts, should I just stay on this track and be happy, I mean we all live different lives"
1,Do neurotypicals exist??. I really can't comprehend the fact that there are people just walking around with no mental illness or trauma. What is that like?
1,"Having a family that doesn't love you sucks.. I (16m) who is adpoted don't think I have seen any signs of love or affection toward me from my adopters. No hugs or kisses or smiles. They provide for me and don't abuse me, but other than that they are just there. My ""dad"" drinks a lot and my ""mom"" is always out with her friends. I had really good friends that made me feel good but literally at the same time they all became obsessed with drugs like 2 years ago and won't talk to me anymore. I don't know if I have any cousins or siblings to talk to. Idk what to do this makes me really depressed. I feel like I have no one to talk to and will never get a hug or feel like someone loves me."
1,"I'm useless. I'm 21 years old, I haven't finish high school, I cry for every little thing, I can't speak with my family, I've hurt the best person I've ever known, I'm losing my battle. 

What can I do?"
1,"one of my friends told me that i’m not dead because i didn’t try hard enough in my suicide attempts. something about my friend saying that just irked me to new levels. i can’t pinpoint exactly what it was that sent me into this fit of rage and sadness; it’s probably either because i’ve tried my hardest to fight against my depression and to survive for my friends’ sake rather than my own, yet here they are... taking it all for granted and provoking me to try harder to die? i mean, people fucking shoot themselves in the head and jump off bridges but still end up surviving. i feel like the fact that i’ve even risked something that very nearly killed me (but, instead, sent me on a luxurious trip to the ER) should’ve already been concerning for anyone who cares. but, i guess what i’ve realized from this sentiment is that nobody really cares. it’s such a shitty reminder that i somehow managed to fail at both life and death.

i didn’t have any words to say back to her. i’m hurt and revolted. it all makes me want to die even more."
1,"i'm not sure if this belongs here. so i've wanted since 5th grade to fall asleep & not wake up & i don't find living particularly fun & my mom got help for depression & anxiety for around 2 years & i've talked to her & apparently our symptoms are similar in lots of ways but she doesn't think i'm depressed because i'm only sad in the afternoons or sometimes the school day & sometimes i get really up & things are fine so she doesn't want to take me to at least see (also therapy is expensive)

am i fake depressed or like just sad & suicidal & that's a normal teenage hormone thing or actually depressed bc i'm probably being dramatic but i'm sick of being sad every day even if it's just the afternoons"

1,"Antidepressants, corona and things, i'm fucking angry. At the beggining, i'm sorry for any text mistakes, english is not my main language. Now, should i start taking antidepressants? What is it like taking them? My therapist offered me some time ago that i could, but i didn't want to, i'm scared i won't be myself, plus it kinda reminds me of all sorts of drugs and i'm generally scared of drugs and things like that cuz i had problem with them in the past, i'm afraid i'll again become too dependant on them. Also, anyone else going crazy during quarantine? Every night i'm getting small panic attacks and i just HAVE to go on a walk at like 03:00 in the night, drink a beer outside and smoke half a pack of ciggaretes or i feel like i'm gonna hurt myself or something. Also, my tooth hurts like hell and i can't do anything about it right now, cuz dentists are closed (fuck you coronavirus) and i'm afraid i'll get addicted to painkillers. Is this even a thing? Becouse i think you can get addicted to anything. Sorry for a long rant, not even sure if this is a good place to post this lol.

Edit: Thanks for the replies, i think i'll talk some more about antidepressants with my therapist. And about my tooth, i had some operation right before quarantine started, now it won't get worse when it comes to medical aspect, it will just hurt till my dentist finishes treating him. So i have to wait, nothing else to do."
1,"I lost my brother. I did that. I made him go. I broke him. He was my friend, then he became my brother. I wanted him to be there the day i got married. Now we're strangers again.  I deserve this but he didn't. People should stay away from me."
1,"I miss my sex drive. (20F) I've been on antidepressants for 2 years, I used to have a high sex drive and now I just really never do and it causes problems in my relationship from time to time. My boyfriend is understanding and all but I feel bad that I'm just never in the mood for anything anymore.
I don't want to stop taking my meds yet, it has made a noticeable difference and I don't think I'd be able to be where I'm at right now if I go back to before I was on them. I guess I'm just wandering if anyone has any ways to help"
1,This coronavirus pandemic is driving me insane. I lost my job. Am socially isolated. Can't find meaning or purpose. Don't know when this will end. Have no hope for the millennial generation. Think Trump is the worst leader this country has ever seen. Don't want to wake up until things are normal again ... that could be a year or more.
1,I'm just so lonely. Not much of my life has changed since this quarantine. I have 0 friends but now since I can't go anywhere I'm just stuck at home with my toxic family with no escape. Everyone's saying how they miss their friends and can't wait to see them again. I have no one. I'll still be in my bed every weekend drowning in this pit of depression and loneliness by myself :/
1,Do people look at you like you are scum?. I see people always give me weird looks like im some sort of creep.
1,"was I just made to please everyone else and get absolutely no love back?. It's 3am and I can't stop crying so sorry if this isn't the place but there's nowhere else I can talk about this. My therapy is cancelled now thanks to covid when I feel like I need it more than ever.

I constantly try to be nice to everyone. My way of living is being nice to everyone no matter what until they give me some reason not to. Whenever I see any of my friends struggling, be it a tweet or a Snapchat story they've posted, a message in a discord server, whatever, I'm always the first person to be there telling them if they need to talk I'm there, and sending encouraging messages. When this covid situation started I could tell it was causing a lot of stress and unhappiness for some of my friends so I bought resources and spent 2 days making little care packages for my closest ones. I baked brownies, and made handwritten encouraging notes, and spent £30 posting them all. Doing good for others makes me feel happy, but I can't help but feel sad when even a fraction of that doesn't get extended back to me when I need it most.

My first boyfriend was extremely abusive, which has left me a bit traumatised since I did everything in my power to be good to him and was, imo, a good girlfriend. I spent half my wage flying from England to Ireland to see him every weekend / every other weekend when he never even came to see me like. When that ended my friends were very supportive, which was nice. I guess that's why I wish they were supportive more of the time, instead of it being such a rare thing. My sister and brother are 2 years younger than me and are in great relationships which I can't help but envy. I'm their older sister yet I'm a lonely unlovable failure. My best friend of 14 years died a couple months back and I still feel the impact, I kinda blame myself tbh, but even then when all my friends knew literally none of them except my other best friend extended so much as a ""hope you're okay"" until said best friend went off on them (we're all in a discord server together) pointing out that I'm always there for them. And right now, I'm going through a deep depression realising I care for everyone but very few people actually care about me, as once again none of those friends I am always there for have said anything, and I'm wishing I could just stop existing, because no one seems to want me to anyway. 

From growing up with kinda crazy parents, to being abused and raped by my first bf who was supposed to love me and now these friends who can't even put in a tiny bit of the effort I do.. I feel like I'm just here to make everyone else happy and to suffer in silence on my own because no one actually cares at all. I have hobbies and interests, I'm starting a diploma next week, I'm not totally hideous and I've been told I'm funny multiple times, idk wtf I'm doing wrong at all. I always message first and put the effort in like I'm supposed to. I'm starting to think I'm just fated to be alone forever.

Anyway this is really long and no one is even gonna read this anyway I just needed somewhere to get this out. If it weren't for my dog depending on me I'd probably be strongly considering just offing myself by this point. I'm so very tired of trying to convince myself it'll get better and my efforts are appreciated. They never fucking are. Thank you if you actually read this. I appreciate you."
1,"Can someone please give me tips to stay motivated on school work?. My school year at college was going alright, until I had to move back home from campus due to corona. Thus am I now in a bad home environment for my mental health (nothing serious just its not good for me being home), that with the combination of online classes, and the feeling like since I'm home I don't have schoolwork, have all lead to me being demotivated and thus falling behind on stuff. I have some 3 or 4 papers that are late and some other 3 assignments that are due or whatever idek atm.

I can't really be productive, at most I get some work done but usually get tired after doing my daily routine and not much gas left for actual school work. Also my sleep schedule is a bit off but kinda fixing that, and again, home isn't a nice place for me so I tend to stay up later than usual cuz its the only time there is peace and ppl rnt here in my house.

 Any tips?"

1,"i just want to get over her but I just can’t. hi, everyone. a bit emotionally upset atm so apologies if this post is messy and long 

i met this girl in sixth grade. well, more like I got a crush on her but I never got the guts to talk to her. after a semester I had to move to a different middle school in the same district so I thought I’d never see her again but for some reason I still held out hope. 

time passes and high school comes around. it’s 9th grade and I’m in English class, talking to acquaintances, when I see her. long story short I get her Snapchat and we become friends. hooray. after a few good months of being friends I confessed to her. we got into the talking stage and I was so happy... maybe too happy. me being a 14-year-old who barely knew how relationships worked I was far too clingy and after about 3 months she broke it up and started dating someone else. I felt awfully because it felt as if I had been cheated on but after some time I realized why she would have done that.. we stopped talking for a while. 

Sophomore year came around and after a good 5 months of self deprecating I was slightly confident that things would turn around. wouldn’t you know it, she’s in my Gov class. we didn’t talk right away, but it was so painful seeing her and then seeing them together. one day I get a text from a random number asking who i was. I return the question. it’s her. for some reason i was okay with being friends. honestly, i had those feelings for her and after not being able to take it anymore, I confessed to her. obviously she was in a relationship so nothing happened. but those were a good 3 months of friendship. 

after a few months of crying myself to sleep, summer finally comes around and I start working a bit on myself. talking to girls. junior year came around and I was feeling okay for the first time in a long time. until I walk into my algebra 2 class and she’s there. I go to my lunch and I see her. a few months later I get a Twitter dm. it was her. she wanted to see how I was. we talked for quite a bit and became friends again. I still had most of those feeling but accepted she was in a relationship so I tried to not pay them attention. anyways, after around 2 months her boyfriend finds out about us (he knew about our ‘history’) and told her to stop talking to me. so we did. about a month or two pass and we talk again. I can’t remember how, exactly. anyways, he finds out and breaks up with her. she blames me for it and we stop talking. a few days later she texts me saying how they got back together. she keeps on saying it’s ‘toxic’ but she wants to be with him. anyways, we stop talking for a good while. this was like November (I think) and she texted me on the holidays to wish me happy holidays. January comes and she says how they broke up. he had cheated on her. we talk for a few days and I realize I gotta act on my feelings so I do and I confess. after talking it out we realize we both want to make it work out so we do. we are on the talking stage again and it’s all good for a few weeks. until she tells me she’s been hanging out with him. I ask her to please stop because not only do I feel uncomfortable with that, but he has brought so much misery into my life. she refuses, so I end things. a couple of weeks pass and she texts me. saying how she apologizes and wants to make work things work out again. I told her I’d be okay with that as long as she’ll stop talking to him. she says no, which was a huge red flag that I ignore. for some reason, perhaps out of fear of being lonely again, I tell her as long as they don’t hang out or talk *constantly*. we go for a few weeks and it’s really great. until she tells me he was going to go pick her up. it was like 11pm. I told her to please not go but she said it was okay. after a night of feeling miserable I woke up and waited for her to be up. when she was, I asked her how it went. she told me they kissed. I ended things right there and then. 

Last week I was texted her at around midnight. I had received a text from her that apparently was delayed a few weeks so I asked what was going on. we talk about everything that has happened between and somehow we both still want it to work out. I tell her again that she can’t hang out w him if she wants to try again but she says she can’t because now he’s in her friend group. I ask her that then she just doesn’t talk to him and then she says she won’t do anything. that apparently I’m the person she wants. she tells me that maybe we shouldn’t start anything right away because she needs some time. I tell her I’m okay with waiting for her (I wasn’t). one day in the morning she texted me the image of a pregnancy test with a faint second line asking me if there was a second line. I immediately ask her if she had sex and she tells me she did ... this is during this whole quarantine thing so I haven’t seen her in weeks. she doesn’t tell me who it was but I’m pretty sure who it was. anyways, we stop talking. 

today I was going to walk my dog as I usually do when I see the two of them by my house (she knows where I live) and I almost broke down crying. why? why does this have to happen to me? I think I was talking to her out of fear of losing her and being lonely but i don’t know. I’m just usually so lonely. I’ve tried talking to other girls and things just never work out. I do have friends and my family situation is okay but this kind of stuff breaks me, especially because of my age and how much importance there is in these kinds of things. I don’t know what to do, honestly."

1,"I want to be great. Ever since I was a little kid I’ve always wanted to play in the NFL and having played football my whole life made me think maybe I would really accomplish my goal. I guess life had different plans for me because one injury ended my career and got rid of my scholarship and future. So one year after the day I was injured I’m thinking why do I have such a longing for greatness if there’s only one thing I’ve ever been good at and it’s just suddenly been ripped away from me. I’m at a stalemate with life, if football wasn’t what I was meant to be great at then what, I’ve never had any other passions or dreams. Does everyone feel this way, the longing to work as hard as you can just to feel like you accomplished something in life. I don’t know what’s next in my life and truly that is one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever had. To not know wether or not my life will be worth nothing to me when it does end. Or will I have achieved my internal feeling of want and longing. I don’t know what to do or what to pursue anymore but this feeling is eating me up inside and I just want to get rid of it..."
1,"Making Things Worse For A Depressed Significant Other. My girlfriend has been struggling with depression during this COVID crisis.  She's out of work, feels like she has no purpose, and is stressing without her structured routine, social life, and income. I've been there for her through it but I'm afraid that I've done some harm with the way I've handled it recently.  We spent hours in bed the night before Easter and talked about her depression.  I'll be the first to admit that I don't know what it feels like so I did my best to empathize and point out that everything is going to be alright and that there is support in her friends, and of course all our love. The next day I went home and then was texting her throughout the day.  I told her how happy she makes me to be alive, and how great I felt because of the people that surround us. I told her that she was my family and that through the highs and lows there is always love. How fortunate and lucky I am considering the circumstances of the virus.  She took this horribly and said that I ruined her day and now has asked me to leave her alone.  Reflecting on it now, I can see how she may have interpreted this all negatively although I had the best intentions.  I feel so guilty for making her feel worse, and that my expression of love and care can deliver the polar opposite response. I guess I'm coming here to ask for the advice of others who've experienced a relationship that has/had a depressed partner.  What did you say and how did you say it? How do you successfully navigate depression and support your partner without making them angry with you? Forgive my ignorance if what I've said to her is exactly what you are NOT supposed to say.  I'm not sure what to do..."

The darkness within is caving in

1,"Anybody know how to feel your emotions again?. 16 year old male here 

I have suppressed my emotions to the point where I don’t really feel them, it was great at the start but now it’s awful I can’t connect with people feeling now and it makes me question myself.

Anybody have tips on how to get them back?"
1,"Looking for some advice. A few significant things in my life aren't quite right at the moment (on top of covid,) and I'm falling deeper into depression even though I've been trying not to for months. I really value resilience and mindfulness, but I'm currently in a situation that has no immediate solution and it's eating away at me.

As it gets worse, I'm noticing that it seems like my low energy levels contribute to a sense of less agency and control over what I do and focus on, like there's a piece of my brain/emotions (like confidence and joy) blocked off from my perception that I forgot how to access, and like I'm forgetting who I am, what I've accomplished, and what makes me actually feel joy.
Writing helps but I forget what I write so often, and I forget to make time to journal, and I forget to reread the helpful things I have written. 

The brain fog makes this feel like one big memory block.

Does anyone have any advice or steps to help overcome these things? 

I have anxiety too that contributes to my struggle with focus and memory but my depression is definitely getting past the mild point and I want it to stop and feel like myself again. I feel like an out of touch stranger. I want to feel like I am useful with a purpose again."

The worst part about my depression is that I have no reason to be depressed, and the fact that I’m depressed may be a feeling that I am giving to myself and I am the reason I am depressed. However, that, in itself, is a symptom of depression. Fun.

This isolation is really not fun, but it beats having to live."

1,"Need advice on Relationships and depression. So I've been with my boyfriend 6 months and its been tough due to the fact i have depression. He is a lovely man and tries to help but he doesn't understand what is going on in my head. For example, he will tell me to list 10 positives about myself cause that will immediately work on taking away the negative thoughts and I've tried to explain to him it doesn't work like that but he just thinks i can be fixed quickly. Does anyone have any advice on how to help their partner understand their mental health?? No matter what i try i end up feeling worse and feel like the bad guy cause i just don't know how to explain it"
1,"I was happy with the birthday messages I got from my internship “friends” until another girl’s birthday came up today and made me realize no one there thinks of me as a friend lmao. I’ve made zero friends in college and I honestly from the bottom of my heart believed that my internship colleagues were my friends. I opened up so much to them, did the absolute most to overcome my anxiety and approach them first, and I thought they enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed theirs. 


On my birthday I got some “happy birthday xoxo” and was over the moon and felt good, so life was like WELL. I THINK THE FUCK NOT. 


Today is this girl’s birthday. She’s been in this internship for FOUR MONTHS. I’ve been in it FOR OVER A FUCKING YEAR. Everyone sent her HUGE ass messages, like “i love you so much you’re so lovely i miss you we’re so lucky to work with you” “you’re such a nice and beautiful person inside and outside, I wish you the best, let’s hang out soon” and ooooh boy, what a reality check"
1,"Emotions suffocating me. So much thoughts coursing my mind.. months of solitude slowly deteriorating my mental health, feeling more and more alienated as the days pass by, each blend into one. All this running around, I can’t fight it much longer. Something’s trying to get out and it’s never been closer."
1,"I thought I beat it.. I’ve felt good for a while - almost two years. 

But this fucking quarantine, I can’t work, I’m home with kids, and it’s all creeping back.

I resent my husband. Hate my life. Mad at my kids.

I logically know I have the tools to stop depression before I hit rock bottom, but I’m tired of fighting it. I’d rather let it win. I’m tired.

I’ve been doing all the things that normally work - getting outside in fucking freezing temps just for a little sunshine, doing loads of yoga, eating well and taking supplements, saying affirmations, meditating, putting my phone down.

I’m just so tired."
1,I posted in the therapy sub but want to post it here too! Anyone else feel this way? Sorry I have a hard time putting thoughts into words!. So My depression gets really bad then it kinda lifts and I feel happy and away from the bad thoughts and anxiety only to stop what I’m doing  to actively get better because I feel I am! I find myself quitting therapy when I’m in a better spot but it doesn’t last and when depression comes back I’m real bad again maybe worse! Anyone else? I’ve had 3 sessions so far and reached out for help and had the first appointment during a bad depressive episode but as the episode is temporarily lifting I find therapy kind of unhelpful because I’m not in the head space but I know it will return? It’s confusing and I wonder if anyone else had this thought or experience?
1,"i don't know how stop this self-destruction cycle. Well, to get started, i feel like really lonely person. i have family and friends that i think  i care them, but  constant feeling of the opposite. For a long time, i have inability of really express myself, trying to be what i'm not for no disturb anyone, and getting so stressed about what i can say.    

for the past two year, in  wake of an abussive relationship and big depression  with suicidal thoughts because of the pressure of my situation, and get really better for a while. But unfortunately i end up get back again of a feeling of emptyness and no expression of myself, losing my goals and interests in what i care. 

i try make changes but i failed all of my attempts of it, ending worst, starting to smoke and drink more that i should, losing good frienships i getting away of my family.

i'm tired but also lost, so i don't  know if it is a good idea this, in the end i only wanted to express sincerely what it is in my head.

sorry for the misspelling it is not my native language, and i new in reddit."
1,"Struggling to Wean Off Last Bit of SNRI? Really bad nervousness/jittery. Any tips?. Taking magnesium. Fish oil. Meditating. I'm on the last 25 mg of Pristiq (down from 150). But its XR and they dont come in any lower dose. And my psych and I agreed Im so low in pristiq adding another ssri like prozac more so helps getting down from high to low doses. We both kind of agreed to just rip the bandaid off, but the nervousness is terrible.

Any other ideas to help me push through this?"
1,"My bf broke up with me during his depression.. My bf & I have been dating for several years now. Every year during the fall/winter months he becomes depressed. However, in the previous years it wasn’t that bad. He said that he’s had this since he was younger and he just recently opened up to me about it. Now looking back I can see a common trend to some of his actions.

Things in our relationship have progressed a lot over the last several months/year. We’ve both grown together and learned from each other. We’ve spoken bout marriage, kids & a future. 

Like every couple we do have our down moments. He’s a very fun & friendly guy. Due to some past experiences, including with him, I have trust issues & that leads to some discussions but we always overcome them. 

Overall, we are super fun loving, we vibe so well, we joke, we have the same social energy & it’s great. He’s not from here & we are both not from the same ethnic background so we do share some cultural differences but nothing serious.

I’m writing on this for the first time because I really am at a loss & am seeking some advice. Nearly a month ago, he broke up with me bc he said he was feeling disconnected with a lot of things, people & feelings. He can’t find a connection with anything & there’s a lot going on in his mind. He has become such an amazing person over the last several years & he always thanks me for the growth that he’s made & the love/support that I give him. He said that this break is solely about himself and working things out. He doesn’t know how long it will take & doesn’t want me to just sit around & wait for him while he’s trying to figure things out; he thinks that would be selfish of him to ask of me. I told him & tell him everyday that I am waiting for him, I’m supporting him, I love him & whenever he is ready to talk/open up, I am here to listen to it all. 

We still talk everyday & chill weekly-ish but he is trying to distance himself so he doesn’t call me terms of endearment or act fully normal with me. Some days I get insecure & think that maybe this is about him wanting other girls. He always reassures me that it’s not about that & that if it ever came to that, he would tell me but really all he’s looking for is to be alone & work on himself for right now.

I try to stop getting upset over my insecurities & pushing that onto him but it is hard. He is still so understanding & reassures me as much as he can while he is going through this. I feel bad bc I want to be there for him as much as possible & I want him to open up to me so he can heal. I’d love more than anything to be together with him again.

During this COVID-19 quarantine, I see he is struggling to keep his mental heath up. He says how he wants to play sports or see his friends or even just go to class so he can get out of the house a little. He’s more of a homebody but he does enjoy going a few places & being around people. I’ve suggested working out, reading a book, making a puzzle, painting, playing video games... literally everything & he does do some of them but he is struggling more now since it’s been a few weeks at home.

Any advice on what I can suggest for him, actions I should take on how to make things better or anything that will help (both his mental health & our relationship)?

Thanks in advance (: Stay safe!

PS: sorry this was so long, I wanted to give some background"
1,Whenever you’re in a group. Do your friends critique you for being too quiet or weird/creepy and then you start to open up more and they still critique you for being annoying/weird? Lol there’s just no winning for me. I just stick to very small talk now. Mostly quiet. I don’t know how to please some people.

1,"Am I just being sensitive?. i'll try to make this short but this is something that's been bothering for a bit TLDR at the bottom 

Me and my sister both grew up with alcoholic parents, we went through the same trauma but my sister was always the more rebellious, bubbly and happy one. While I grew up with multiple suicide attempts, a bunch of scars from self harm and severe depression. 

I feel like I was just to sensitive to handle my parents fighting and I grew up depressed. I don't really remember much of my childhood so maybe I went through a lot worse than what I can remember but from what I know I feel like I was just being sensitive. I'm just so frustrated why did my sister grow up right and why did I turn out so wrong. 

She has so many friends, she's really sociable and outgoing, she's really affectionate towards my parents. While I stay to myself and get so damn uncomfortable when I have to open up to anyone especially my parents. 

Though we did move towns when I started middle school and me figuring out I was transgender and being stuck in the closet. Combined with the fact I was in a completely new school and lost all my old friends contributed a lot to my depression. While my sister hated the old town we lived in and for her moving was a fresh new start. I basically hit my lowest point in life. (But freshman year is when I was able to come out and transition and i've been so much happier and came out of my shell a lot more.)

I don't know i feel fucking pathetic, i don't deserve too have as many scars and suicide attempts. I mean people cope in different ways, my sister was a lot more emotional and rebellious than I was. I still feel like I was overreacting. Is there just something wrong with me? Am I just sensitive? I feel like I grew up wrong.

TLDR: Me and my sister grew up with alcoholic parents, we went through similar stuff. But while I grew up depressed and suicidal she grew up outgoing and positive. Was I just too sensitive to handle it? I feel like I grew up wrong."
1,My best friend blocked me and I'm not sad about it. So my best friend and I had fought a while back like we just stopped talking cause I got mad at her for telling my sister something private but then I thought we worked things out but a couple weeks ago she just blocked me on all platforms and when I saw her at church and asked her about it she just shrugged her shoulders so I told her I was done with her bullshit and walked away and ik i should me sad about it but I dont feel anything about it. Which really worries me because I'm afraid that my depression is getting bad again.
1,"Help. Okay, I don't know where to start from this, but if there any spelling errors im sorry, because the tears are covering my eyelids. But I guess I should start with the fact that I'm not normally a suicidal person but the though has been crossing my mind whenever bad moments come and go since August (me moving in with my dad) and im also not just some edgy guy looking for attention, but I honestly don't know where else to go. I can't even tell if this is my way of coping, or if I think some magical solution will come from this. But im desperate. So one problem i've been having is with myself. It's not that i've everhaf trouble making friends but it's something else. I can't pinpoint it but I would make friends at school because imbalone. I have never actually walked up to someone to befriend them ive always just sat by myself and people came to me. Yet I was still a really outgoing person I just didn't how. Kind of pathetic for someone who has been to 7 different school because of moving huh? So I'm already a guy with not a lot of friends. But the main place I made friends was over online gaming. And ive met so many people that I know have changd me for the better. And i had thisnone really close friend named joey, I met him while playing rainbow 6 and we became good friends since. Bit then shorlynafter I moved here I was told by one of our other friends (who was close to his half brother) that he'd commitednsuicde. And that was the first big death ive ever had in my life. AND IT WAS ONLINE and in still thinking back to wether or bot I couldve done somthing to make it better because we were just having a blast on overwatch two nights begore. I know its bot my fault and that his family was mourning so much more. So i told everyone in our friend group to send his mother our condolences and it turned out okay.

Now indont know the character limit on reddit so im gonna keep thisbshprt. Im mainly just sad because I habe no form of control in my life right now. I move to minnesota with my dad with 4 other little brothers on is 11 and doesnt do any of his chpres and gets away with it he doesnt even feed his animals (beong two cats turtle and a lizard). Ones 9.amd has some learning problems, so he hets leniency, but that's fair. And the others who are 6 and 3 just run around messing up, stealing food from the kitchen, allowed to curse for some reason. And all of this haappens while they are under the watxh of my dad and step mom. So I the oldest at 16 have to clean the whole kitchen, that my step mom perpously messes up and allows my brothers to get away with eatimg in there. And the one that put me into this mess, cleaning the EMTIRE downstairs. So my dad and stepmom jave been sleeping down here for the past few nights with my little brothers (6&3) and they are supposed to go upstairs and sit in their bed by 8. But for some reason, they have been allowed to ait dpwn here with them and MESS UP THE PLACE. The parents are sitting there breaking their own rules by bringong all of these quilts and covers downstairs, Nd bringing tons of food and drinks. They also just let my little brother get all of these chips and drinks spilled all over the place. And then they just dont clean ot up... This has been happening for the past 3 nights now, and I began to get sick of it. Zince I'm cleaning up after MY OWN PARENTS, and no ome else is doimg any of their chores at all! My little brother (11) isnt cleaning his room or the upstairs bathroom, and my otger brother (9) ismt doing his room or the dinong room, amd getting away with it. And i get my xbox taken away because MY LITTLE BROTHERS WHO DONT EVEN LISTEN TO THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THEIR CHORES??? And since im supposed to be the ""big brother"" and clean up after everyones messes, and constantly tell these little rats to do what they are supposed to, and apparemtly act as the damn house maid 24/7. Just to get yelled at for doing a parents job... So later today, I tried to confront my dad softly, since the day befoew he asked me if everyrging was okay, and if I needed to talk about anything. And thatbtime i said no. But today i try and ask him ""dad, if you and my stepmom are here watching these kids, can you make sure they don't mess up""? And at first he said ""yeah"". Keep in mind that this same day, my stepmom said no games for anyone because she finally decided to do something aboutbthe kids not doing their chores, but it didnt make sense for me to be in trouble since i don't jave a SINGLE grade under 97, and my kitchen amd downstairs have been spotless (but my dad told me it was because I wasnt makomg the kids do their chores as i said above). And i guess she ran her mouth at my dad, because thats all he was saying when he started getting mad. So he literally just got mad because i politely asked him to not let the kids mess up.

So then, he decided to beat me...
I was just so shokes, and to thin kbaout it is starting to make me cry again because i cant believe that the one man i used ti look up to, just beay me over a situation so rediculous. And this was only the second time it happened. I remember about a month ago he was on the couch woth my step mom, and when i walked by he asked me about wheyger or not i had any friends. And of course i had some ao said yes, but I think some thoughts began to spill out of me because I didnt cry, but tears started to fall. And so my dad asked me why I was crying, and once I said no reason, he punched me to ground, and started throwing punhes at my ribs that later went into him slamming me onto the ground.. All because I was sad about my sacial life.
And of course theres a lot more to it, but im just so sad right now because there's nothing i can do, i cant talk about it because i would risk of making my dad or stepmom mad, i cant vent with any of my friends because im not allowed to, and i dont want to do nothing because I'd just go back to being a complete house maid. amd its not cleaning that's the problem, it's the punishments i get for not making the kids do their chores, or for not cleaning up after them roght. So I'm just lost as to what to do. Um just here contemplating running away, or flat out suicide. But I don't know what to do if I run away, simce I dont want to steal food and mess someone else's life up. So theres just suicide and the only thing stopping that is the fear of what could come since it either eternal nothingness, or if religion tirns out to be true, eternal damnation. But im afraid that once I'm pushed over that fear, there wouldnt be any going back...

So please, if you know of ANYTHING i can do, help"
1,"Looking at my old photos. I've been doing mostly good during this whole quarantine, most of my depression comes from the anxiety I get around other people. But looking back through my pictures it really sucks to see how sad I am. Like, I deserve to feel good about myself. But looking back through, literally a few years of my life, all I can see are photos of myself with a depressed look in my eyes. It scares me to see that. I could easily slip back into what I'm so used to. Depressed and isolated..

I haven't been seeing my therapist since the quarantine. But mostly because I felt like I was okay just staying home. Idk, it's just sad to see myself in so much pain"
1,"I want to see a professional but I don't want my parents to know.. So basically in 2020 my depression has started to become major, or at least I feel like that's the case. Everyday I've been feeling down, and have felt a lack of motivation and a decrease in energy. I've been feeling huge amounts of guilt and remorse, and I've started to fear the passing of time, and change in general. I find my feelings really hard to explain, as theres quite a lot behind it. I want to see a professional about it, but I can't really because I'd have to tell my parents I want to go, and that wouldn't work out; my mum found out I was slitting my wrist, which I feel awful about because she claims she's worried about me and that makes me see myself as an awful person for causing grief to her, and she told me that whenever I feel down I have to talk to her. But first of all, I don't feel comfortable talking to her about most of the roots of my feelings, and second of all, whenever I do, she doesn't do anything about it, she just tells me to cheer up or something, and generally just doesn't understand how I feel. So basicallly, if I asked my mum to take me to a professional, she'd probably refuse to and tell me to tell her about my emotions. I'm not gonna ask my step dad because I hate him and he hates me. Moreover, I feel pretty crappy wanting to see a professional, as I know that most teens in the world probably feel the stuff I feel, and plus I don't even know if my feelings are a big deal. I might just be overreacting or attention seeking, I don't know. There are billions of people in the world, so my feelings don't have any worth, and there are millions of people who probably feel way worse. I don't think talking to an online person would help as they probably wouldn't be able to provide a diagnosis, and plus I feel that they would understand more if we were in a room together. Plus I emailed childline about my problems and they didn't really help.

What could I do? Is there a way I could see a professional by myself, without anyone knowing? I wanna debunk my insecurities, and I want someone to understand how I feel and explain things to me. 

Also, I know the pandemic at the minute makes it impossible, I'm talking about when it is over."

  Macbeth, act 5, scene 5. 

For most of my life I have been struggling with depression, and tonight is the lowest I have felt in quite some time, because right now I feel as if nothing I do or say matters. 
  
  Right now, I feel as if I am shouting into the void, and it refuses to hear me, which also explains how I feel about Reddit, Instagram, tumblr and any other social media site, as I post and post day after day and no one responds, no one cares. 

  I wish, that I could say something that no one could ignore, but it will never happen, due to the fact that I am nothing, a nobody, something that no one will ever care about."
1,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that no one cares about you and if you disappeared none of your friends would miss you?. I feel like I don’t matter to anyone. And if I left it wouldn’t really have an impact on them.

I don’t even think they like talking to me tbh. I think they sort of put up with me. I don’t think they’d be happy if I was gone, just that it wouldn’t have that great of an effect on them.

I think my family would care, luckily. But to everyone else, they just wouldn’t.

Edit: I’m going through a really bad depressive episode. I was diagnosed late 2017 after the worst depression I had at that point. And I already know this is gonna be worse. And I hate the fact that I’m aware of my emotions, the effects it has on me, and the levels at which this depression hits me."
1,"Is anyone else kind of dreading the end of quarantine?. I know this quarantine is absolutely horrible for a lot of people, so not everyone will agree with me on this. But...

Confession; I am fucking loving being in lockdown. I think it’s a really shitty situation and I’m sorry that everyone the world over is being affected to negatively by this, but I’m making the best out of it. I’ve only recently started working on my mental health and acknowledging my depression and anxiety since last December. This time to just focus on myself and be, with no responsibilities or family drama or struggling to get out of bed for people I don’t want to work for while making no money and actually getting to spend time with my husband has been a major blessing for me. A week before lockdown I was discharged from the hospital for having a major depressive episode due to a new medication. I usually compare my depressive mood to being dark grey/going black, which is where I was before lockdown, and now I’m a light/medium grey. I already know I’m gonna go back to black when it’s over. It’s going to be really hard to have to force myself to function all over again and knowing the same bullshit stressors that made me feel bad before are waiting for me is already bringing on the dark mood. It’s not like I’m getting salaried pay or anything, my unemployment is not going through and I’m fighting with them for over three weeks now, so I’m broke as shit. I’m just appreciating the fact that my brain and body can take a break for the time being."
1,"Corona is really hurting my mental health. My son is stuck in Ohio with my mom. I got out of the military and moved to N.C. for college. I got an apartment in February and the navy finally brought my stuff in March right before things started shutting down. Due to listing my house and waiting on furniture my son had to stay with my mom. My sons sperm donor can’t have him for overnights until he does a drug rehab program. And i didn’t think it was fair for my son to be crashing between places while I waited for things to fall in place. 
Now he’s stuck in Ohio till this virus is over. My family was posting Easter pics. He’s 2 now and last Easter he had so much fun getting eggs. It’s the first holiday I haven’t been able to go up there and see him. I’ve been to depressed to finish unpacking. I lost my job but luckily I have benefits that I’m able to use to pay my bills. But it’s stressful. I just want my baby back, the sooner this virus ends the sooner he can come down. 
Last week I reached out to the veterans crisis line and talked to someone through text. Lately I’ve been wishing I could just go to sleep till this blows over. I don’t want to exist but I don’t want to die. Also can’t get into Veteran’s mental health till the end of May. I just want to talk to a specialist but I have to wait and it sucks. 
One of my friends is a specialist but I don’t want to just use her since she has actual patients paying her. I did have a chat and she helped me realize my ptsd “diagnosis” (not confirmed my an actual mental health doc just my pcm) is actually cptsd. I was telling her the symptoms and she was able to guess it was my sons father that caused them. I feel like I’m going through this alone. 
I told my mom and family through Facebook messenger. My dad messaged my mom and said it was bullshit and I’ve had the ptsd symptoms since I was a kid. 🙄 but doesn’t have the balls to actually message me about it. I havnt found a good time to talk to my boyfriend about it. He doesn’t talk to my ex husband anymore but they use to be friends and it’s weird. I want to talk to him soon but he’s also been moody lately as well. He’s been working more as a cyber security person from home than he has at work.

My mom is depressed, she lost her job because of covid and is getting divorced from my father. It's an amicable divorce and she's financially very well off, but she's very worried about the future. Speaking with her she says she has no energy, she can barely bring herself to get up. I don't really know how to help her, me and my brother are doing house chores, I help paying the bills, but I don't feel I'm giving the emotional support she needs.

1,"Too depressed to do anything. I know this sounds stupid, but I am having to change my life routines due to the fact that I can't bring myself to do stuff. Even the basics like bathing are becoming difficult for me. I have official paperwork to do that seems to have just disappeared into the ether. I am having a hard time eating, doing laundry and putting things away. Too anxious to walk outside. Nothing interests me. Ive tried reading, Ive tried using internet sites to be entertained, Ive tried watching movies or tv to pass time. Talking to people is exhausting. It all just seems mindless and difficult. It feels defeating that everything feels this way. All I can bring myself to do is get through work. At this point I've considered that I hardly buy any food because it goes bad. I don't buy things that need to be cooked. I can't eat unless I'm super hungry and once I eat a little then I just am not motivated to eat more. Food also makes a mess that then becomes a problem of cleaning up. The thing is it is all an excuse to be lazy so I convince myself to roll with the punches and just be ok with this and adapt to this because otherwise I'd just be complaining. The company of others feels robotic. I feel like my conscience is going into illness and slowly withering away while my body tries to stay afloat. I know I will survive this but I do feel like a dirty pathetic human even though I know I am ambitious and have a lot to look forward to. I forget to drink water. I dont feel like drinking water."
1,"my friend always thinks she’s right but i still love her.. this might be a shit reason to get all worked up and stuff but like okay.

me and my long time best friend who i would die for were playing minecraft. We got off and agreed to get back on at six, which would be two hours before we were gonna invite two others to our world. 

i haven’t slept in a day or so and i was gonna take a nap, but she said no bc we were gonna get on at six. six cake around and she didnt get on. i was pissed.

she then said at 8 that she never agreed to six and that she didn’t wanna answer my messages. she could have at least gave me a heads up so i could have slept or not felt like shit bc she was ignoring me

so at 8 i mention how she forgot ab me and she PISSED OFF and says how i’m lying and how she never said 6 when we fucking agreed to it’s making me all worked up and i wanna cry and fucking slice me open bc she always does this.

she always says that she’s right. She doesn’t know it’s so triggering to have to tell her that she’s right all the time even tho she’s not. i was right in this situation and she still made me say it was her so she wouldn’t get mad

she does it as a joke sometimes which is semi okay, but when she’s serious is makes me wanna fucking cry. When she’s in a bitch mood she’s in a bitch mood and i can’t even talk to her at that point bc i can’t deal with it.

and yeah, it’s triggering to be told your wrong all the time. 

but at the same time i wish i could tell her about this and everything but i’m afraid she would just say something that would make me upset ig.

idk what this post is either too.."
1,i relapsed and i’m not living for myself anymore. i’m not alive for myself. i’m alive for everyone around me. for my friends and my family. i don’t care about myself. i love every day hoping it could be my last. i relapsed again and i’m not proud but it happened and i don’t know what to do about it. i’m so tired of everything and being hurt.
1,"22/M depressed because of love. I think love is a cycle - and it happens every single time. I am still young, just a measly 22 years old. However, I feel like i have experienced much more than others when it comes to this...

It always begins the same.. infatuation, butterflies in the stomach, staring at your phone waiting for that message or call.

That is my favorite stage, without a doubt.

I get so involved in this stage, at times I wish I could just hit a pause button to have more time to appreciate the beginning of a relationship. In retrospect, I feel like I always move too fast, and that's where the problem arises.

Then you get to the relationship, and things are amazing. You begin to be together more, start declaring your feelings for the person as much as you can, the feelings of wanting to be with this person every minute of the day just keeps getting stronger.

Until something happens, usually something negative that happens to me, like a depressive effect or an instance of anxiety. And that is when the beginning of the end happens. When you show them that you're a human like everyone else, with real life problems.

And one day their tone is different, they don't sound the same as they used to, and slowly it progresses. Until you receive a text saying that its just not going to work out.

Its a cycle, a cycle that I'm tired of being a part of"
1,"I Feel Guilty and He's Stuck in My Head. I was in a shitty relationship last year with someone  that was on and off with me a couple of years before. I don't know why I was even in a relationship with him again in the first place after all the different times he left me for someone else. I guess it's because people like him find insecure people like me and just plant themselves in our heads. 
I have worked at the same place for over three years and over time got to know a guy there. I never (tried) to think anything of him to begin with, but I think people knew I felt something for him anyways. I'm not very good at hiding my bashfulness. He seemed to be everything I wanted out of a person.
Things were not going well in the relationship I was in. I was duped yet again, he wasn't going to change. He said he got a coworker's number just to see if he still had game, quit the job I got him, constantly belittled me in his ""subtle"" ways. I was fully convinced I was going to commit to breaking up with him. I wanted to talk to the coworker so badly that night, and my alcoholism helped out with that. Called him, told him how I felt and that I was going to dump the ex the next morning. 
But I didn't. That's most definitely where the conversation began but he threw a tantrum and ""tried"" leaving without his stuff. In hindsight I see I was being manipulated but when I tried to calm him down and he started bawling about how he wanted to marry me, I felt horrible and like I was about to throw away everything for someone I've never been with. Who might just leave me high and dry after a hookup. I let my insecurities be fed and stayed with ex for a little konger. I told my coworker after work the next day.... he didn't seem upset, he gave me a hug and told me he understood. But then he seemed.... different. 
I broke up with ex for good after I found out something disgusting he said to my sister and how he stole another sister's ear pods. Hurting my sisters drew the line for me.
And I went to the coworker, he just wanted to stay friends and he would hang out with me and my friends for the next few months occassionally. A few months ago we were still texting sometimes and joking around. But, knowing I hurt him still haunts me. I've never done anything like that before and it was the shittiest thing I'd ever done to the person I didn't know I was going to hurt. I still cry about it and feel selfish for hoping he'll forgive me someday and want to try again. I try to escape thinking about him but I can't. I've got other shit going on in my life too but this feels like the biggest weight."
1,"I need help. I am a 17 yr old male living under a mother who verbally and physically abuses me (I was diagnosed with depression earlier this year, and take Lexapro for it). Nothing insane that leaves scars or bruises, but she is constantly calling me retarded, slow, weak, and pushes me around. When I try to call people, my father, or the police, she says she will pull me from my school and that my life will be over- she also threatens to kick me out of the house. For context- I cannot go live with my father, I am stuck with her and I don't know what to do. I have contemplated suicide multiple times, and when I told her she told me to ""do it"". She has refused to give me dinner and I dont know what to do- she has cut off my credit card and locked me in my room- it is because I asked her why she stole money from my father's child support (which she uses for herself, and not me or my little brother) and did not put it into a trust for us. Please, if you're out there- help me."
1,"i feel like no one will ever love me romantically. I told my crush that I liked her and she told me she didn't have the capacity to feel anything for anyone at the moment, the next week I heard from a mutual friend that she's on a date with someone else. Then we (the crush and I) met up with some friend to go downtown and she was there with her date and they were doing pda in front of me and she acted as if she was oblivious to what she told me about her not being able to have feelings for anyone. Do I have the right to feel sad? because I feel like i'm over reacting. I'm not sad about her having a date, i'm sad about her lying to me because we are friends after all and friends are supposed to be honest with each other, right?"
1,"I lost myself. I don't what to do. I feel like I lost myself, like I am not myself anymore. I find myself wanting to go home but I am here, standing my house surrounded by my family yet I want to leave and run. 

Run anywhere, they are good people, but I just can't stand it anymore. Like I don't want to stay home. I do all my hobbies on the little free time I have from my stupid online classes. But I just can't feel that spark of pleasure anymore. 

I go outside feed the neighborhood cats, yet I have just become numb to all life. I envy them sometimes because at least they can feel something unlike me. I just feel like failure, a fake undeserving person. I help people so I can try to be a good person. I feel so selfish for being sad. I have everything I could ever need, but I am not happy I feel like a body with nothing inside but a pile of shit with a decent face.

I just slap a stupid smile and try to enjoy life but I just can't. I don't want to lie anymore. I want to scream for help from my family, but I just can't they stressed enough. I've tired therapy and self harm neither were able to please my pain. I ask of you reading this to please give me some hope please. 

So I can leave this horrible mental prison. I want to be happy with my family, my love ones,and my friends. I need someone to help me. I don't want be a bother anymore. I don't want to be sad anymore please just help me."
1,"My past is garbage.. Sorry for bad English. My past is full of bad memories, traumas and times when ı was humiliated. No matter how much ı don't wanna remember, it comes to my mind and instantly lower my hapinnes in everywhere and ı feel like shit. It brings the feel that if ı'm ever gonna be happy person. I'm so fucking tired of it."
1,"So I decided to tell my ex to not be in a relationship, and I don’t feel well anymore.. She said she broke up and she didn’t care about him, and me being the supportive one, says that I don’t want to be in a relationship and just stick with just friends. I immediately regretted saying that and feel more down than I ever did before."
1,"just a dumb question. I have depression, and the whole quarantine thing has made it really come out, but I've been spending a lot of time talking to friends on Discord. I say and post a lot of stupid things, and I'm no good at any of the games we play together, but they always welcome me. They're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. I think one guy, Rico, notices when I'm feeling off. He asks if I'm doing alright but I just give some vague answer. He's married with two young kids and I really don't want to drag him down into anything.

I'm one of the newer members of the server, and the guys who have been friends for awhile like to hang out with each other mostly. In addition, most of them are admins and moderators for the server. So, one day I was hanging out by myself in a voice channel when Rico pulls me into a hidden chat so I wouldn't be alone. One other guy, who isn't a mod, complained. He said I was cool, but not enough for the ""circle of trust"". Rico told him to screw off politely.

It's such a small thing, and I feel like I'm overreacting, but it really hurt. I always wondered why I would spend a couple of hours in chat by myself before logging off, then a few minutes later a full squad is in chat playing together. I'm probably being paranoid, but I feel like some of them are avoiding me. Rico says they aren't, but he's also the only one who will join me in a channel when I'm by myself, except for a couple of the newer guys. It feels like there's a clique of friends that the newbies aren't allowed into unless they're with a chaperon, and I hate it.

I want to leave and just let them forget about me, but I don't want to abandon the two or three that I consider to be friends. On the other hand, I don't want to be a burden on Rico that he feels like he has to babysit me all the time. What should I do?"
1,Thoughts before I get high. So I’m writing this while I’m waiting on my plug to pull up. So I’m very depressed and it’s been this way for years u would think after dealing with my depression for years I would be able to start handling it better but that’s not the case. There’s not really anything that can help me even when I smoke sometimes the bad thoughts come in. I just wish I ain’t have to smoke to be some what happy because like right now I’ve been sober for a day and the thoughts are so bad they feel like they actually hurt physically even in a good moment my thoughts will creep up on me. I just want to die I hope I catch the corona and welp just die. I just feel like death is the only answer I’m starting to think there’s nothing else that would help
1,"Part 3 of talking about my depression. Part 3: parent pressure 
Like in all my previous posts I've mentioned or linked to parents and how when going through depression and describing how it's my depression worse 

So majority of the time even if it's for the tiniest of things I get shouted at and get called and idiot because I'm doing it wrong ' or that I'm annoying my parent has a tendency to swear or smoke around me which makes me feel insecure especially when I have two younger siblings living under the same roof and it most likely affects them to 

Furthermore sometimes when I get shouted it is really aggressive and contains some threats because of the cause of my depression not having my biological dad around so I never played catch he wasnt there when I learnt how to ride a back or see me start high school or primary (elementary and middle school for you Americans out there )

Moving on when ever I speak I have a large amount of sincerity behind my vocals where as when I get shouted at theres large amounts of aggression behind it also I have trouble speaking good grammar most of this post is actually automatically correct of completed by my phone:p so I have that running for me 

Heading back to the cause of my depression my biological father being the cause of it is always adding to my depression as it is as I recall I can message him when I'm ready and so when I dont reply I get shouted at which keeps adding to the pile of depression which makes me feel like trash and human filth and that I dont belong on this earth 

Being a 15 yr old white 2/3 english male and 1/3 danish (if I'm correct) makes it worse because my body has not finished growing same for my mind because your mind is actually the most fragile part of your body or conscious if u want to be scientific 

So I want dilly dally much longer this is Everwild signing out (•~•)/"
1,"Is becoming a therapist even worth it. I am going to kill myself eventually, I feel I'm destined for it. I guess all I can do now is occupy the time before I snap, and I was going to do that by pursuing psychology which is the only subject I'm remotely interested in. But to get anywhere I'll need a whole PhD, and when I get there what am I going to do? Lie to people like me who realize medicine and therapy don't work for everyone and tell them it will get better if they keep trying? Why should I even bother getting all that education when Ill just get in debt and kill myself anyway? Why should I work at a firm that's just gonna suck 45 dollars from strugglong patients just to see *me* every session? Why should I be pretending to help people to make myself feel like I'm maybe not a waste of space for 20 minutes? How much incorrect advice will I give? How many of my patients will kill themselves because I failed? I love psychology. I want to help people so bad. I just realistically think it won't make any difference or be worth it. For every patient I help, that'll get erased by the 1 I fail to help. This is the wrong attitude for this field, I know, but I am too lazy and stupid to do anything else- this is already a step down from a harder degree I was going to pursue. I wish I would just die in a car accident and not have to do anything ever again."
1,"Lockdown is messing with me. Hi, I've struggled with low motivation and depression since I've left school after moving away from friends etc, but I dealt with It by powerlifting and loved the gym and it completely changed how I thought about myself and basically turned my life around but since this lockdown I'm struggling to get out of bed and have thought multiple times about overdosing on xanax and alcohol is there anyone who has any tips on something to get me by until this is all over?"
1,"online courses + returning to a toxic home environment are making me intensely suicidal. I have no motivation to get any work done, I'm finishing my junior year of college and I want to finalize this semester strong as I'm a straight A student, but I am so depressed being trapped home due to COVID-19 ever since my college closed down to remote classes for the semester. I have never been so depressed where I am sitting unable to focus or do anything for days, I just sit in my room and try to study and work, but I space out not even procrastinating truly just doing nothing. And all I feel is even more guilty because I feel like I am letting my professors and myself down by being unable to do my work. I feel myself loosing track of contacting my best friend from school, and I feel like I'm becoming fully isolated at home, which in itself is already difficult given the circumstances. Now I'm back in my toxic home environment having to deal with a past abuser who I cannot communicate with. I went a month walking on eggshells before anything became instigated between us in an interaction, but today I finally snapped and broke down. Now I can't even leave my room to go to the kitchen or anything and I've been trying to force myself to sit and work and all I want to do is die.

I've never really been at this intense of a low before where I'm spending days on end starring at a wall or zoning out and disassociating all day. I feel suicidal, and now with all that's happening in the world the short and long term future goals that were propelling me forward through my bad days don't exist because it's all unknown. On top of all this, I've been having extremely vivid nightmares which hasn't really been something I've experienced a lot before nearly every night I guess because I'm in this perpetual state of anxiety and stress. I feel like I can't  just have a single moment of peace to breathe and not feel like absolute shit."
1,Can someone please give me tips to focus on homework while being depressed?. I can't get out of bed and I am behind 1 month on all my assignments. I can't focus or concentrate on anything. I am just too sad and regretful to care about what is going on with my school work. I never let my grades drop before but now I have Cs. Any tips??
1,"I feel like I let everyone down. Let me preface this by saying that I'm currently in high school and my mental health has been really awful ever since I went to my new school. A lot of it has to do with grades since my elementary school was rather easy and I never really faced any difficulty. 

I feel like I'm a massive disappointment to everyone especially my parents. My grades are really bad and they're declining more and more, and although my parents say it's okay, I feel like they don't really mean it and I let them down. In addition, I also feel like I also waste a lot of their time and money. I've picked up and lost interest in so many extracurriculars and sports over the years, and even though I want to say I do try my hardest when it comes to everything, I know deep down that I'm not doing enough and I'm just too lazy and lack motivation to work hard and accomplish my goals.

Online learning has been especially difficult on me since I made it my goal this semester to have all As. However, online learning barely improves my grades at all and I feel fucking terrible that I didn't do something about this before when I had the time to (like several years ago). I'd like to tell myself that it's alright, I'll learn from this experience and I'll try harder next year, but I know deep down that I'm just making excuses to cope with the truth.

As for my friends, most of them are nice but I don't feel comfortable venting to them like this since they'll judge me. They'll tell me things like ""it'll be okay!!"" though I feel it's not as sincere since it's much easier for them to say that when they're not going through the same. My teachers don't really care a lot even though they do try to act like it and often times I feel alone with nobody to turn to. I'd love to have a cat or dog but I can't due to my current living situation. 

Any advice? I've been in tears for the past few hours because I can't fix my grades. People like to tell me that a single number doesn't define me as a person but it'll definitely impact my future."
1,"unsupportive parents. my mom and step-dad are very ‘opposed’ to mental health issues, especially my step-dad, who openly states that people will depression need ‘to get over it’ and it’s all attention seeking (might also add that his son tried to kill himself a couple of years ago, and so I honestly HOPE that my step-dad is just in denial). I’ve been struggling on and off for 5 years, the past 8 months being the worst it’s been since I began to struggle with depression. 

I feel absolutely fucking pathetic. I can’t even begin to describe how much self-loathing I feel at even the thought of how I feel. I hate expressing emotions and find it really hard to open up to my boyfriend for this reason. I can never seem to describe how I feel without feeling gross and I believe this is down to how my parents would react if they found out about how I’ve been struggling.

I’ve been doing online therapy for the past 3 months and it’s honestly barely helped because I can’t bring myself to use it regularly or use the helping tools. My parents aren’t aware of this - although I’ve hinted that I do therapy to my mom but she doesn’t often pay interest. I’m at a point now where I don’t even want to help myself to stop the negative impact I have on those around me - it’s beyond selfish, and I’m beyond caring. 

How I’ve felt has ruined my relationships with almost everyone in my life and I don’t know how to come back. I’m scared about how I’m going to ruin mine and other people’s lives in the long-term. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like a burden on myself and everything I do is just exhausting. I’m so tired.

apologies for the vent. I’m done now, and will most likely sheepishly delete this tomorrow.:)"
1,"I don't know what to do anymore. I just won't be able to last much longer the way I am. I'm just soooo fucking tired of myself. I am unable to vent my negative emotions, so I just let them devour me. I'm the guy you go to when your world is falling apart and I will do everything I can to fix it, but I just can't fix my own world. My friends are trying to help me the same way I helped them, but I for some reason don't trust them. I know, that they are 100% trustworthy and I jad lots of ""deep"" moments with them, but I just can't get myself to trust them, so I can't get them to help me properly. Maybe it's because I don't know what the main problem is.
I would like to work out and build up some of my muscles, but because I don't see result I just give up on it even tho I know that if I keep going the results will start to pop up. I don't have any life goals expect get a family. Im missing love in my life, but it's because when I'm near a girl I just start panicking. I didn't have this problem when I was younger, but I do now... Why?

I hate who I am, but I love myself for who I am. I would love to be more assertive and not be the all out funny guy. But even when I'm trying I just can't change.

The trust issues I have are killing me, as I don't trust anyone. I don't trust my best friends who tell me all sort of things, from their very shameful stories to their failed pick up attempts. But I still don't trust them. I don't trust my family and I don't fucking know why.

I am all about not giving up, but I still give up on myself. 

I feel like I'm missing something in life, but I have no idea what it is.. Is it love? Is it some adrenaline? I just don't know.
I have shit loads of other problems, but the post would be very long.

In all honesty I just don't know anymore. I was trying to help people in this subreddit, but I can't even help myself.

If you read the whole thing than damn.. Thank you, but i don't really think that you can help. I'm really just trying to vent myself and see if I can figure out my next step in life."
1,"Depending on someone for happiness never work.. Once it’s all over, you’re just left with the same empty feeling you started with. On to the next person, right? No, I can’t keep doing this to myself."
1,"1st day of taking medication.. I was very anxious about going to seek help, starting and telling anyone about my situation. Cheers to this journey. I wish you all the endless feeling of unconditional love, the warmth of the sun, and a strong heart."
1,"Am I depressed or am I a teenager?. I don’t really know what to do with my life and I’m just a teenager, I’m constantly sad and I have family issues. I’ve gotten into fistfights with my dad as he sometimes gets very aggressive when I play video games and such, he constantly calls me useless, idiot, stupid, pussy, etc. He hates my interests (which are video games and technology) calling them useless pastimes. I’ve tried to talk about these problems with my mom but she often just tells me they don’t matter and I’ll “walk them off”. 

This has lead me into the point of not knowing weather my problems are important or not, I’m middle class so I definitely know some people have it worse than me. That is why feeling bad about my problems feels stupid to me, and I know I should be happy for what I’ve got, yet I have not been happy for a long time. I usually wonder if I’m depressed or if I’m just a teenager with sad “episodes”. I can’t seem to find the answer, this is why I come to this subreddit 

I have the best grades in my school and I take pride on how quickly I learn, I happily bring my A’s to my dad seeking for some form of recognition but I do not get it, he tells me it is my obligation. I want to make games for a living but now I don’t know if my parents will even support my career choice. 

Thank in advance for your comments and support. (Sorry if my English isn’t that good, my first language is Spanish)"
1,"I need to talk to someone other than my therapist.. Background: I've been clinically depressed, have been diagnosed with social anxiety and have had suicidal ideation since I started college. I started taking prozac and I was on it for about three year before I stopped because I thought I was much better and didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately, the decision to do that was around the same time I decided to start going out and drinking alcohol (8 months ago), which proved to be the worst decision of my life. 

I had a crush on one of my friends for 2 years. I've been called ugly by people, including close friends(jokingly, but it still hurts), never had a girlfriend and have overall been subconscious about my appearance during my 21 years of life. Because of all that I didn't have any confidence in myself. I kept my feelings for her to myself for a year and a half.  I finally decided to tell her how I feel and she said she wasn't looking for anything right now and she would rather remain friends. I was okay with that but I noticed that she became more distant and a couple times I got drunk and drunk texted my feelings -- things I should never say that ended up jeopardizing our friendship. Through that we remain friends until three months ago I drunk texted her again and as a result she blocked me on every social media platform with no explanation. The thought of losing her completely kicked in and I was trying to force a reconciliation by messaging her friends, just trying to explain myself and not lose her because I really did cherished her as a friend. I mentioned hurting myself and not wanting to live. Two days later, I saw her on campus (its a small university), and I tried to talk to her, but she ran away from me and called campus PD, which led to me getting baker acted. 

My crush had always told me how much she loves and cares about me as a friend, how we'd always be friends no matter and how great of a person I am. So never in a million years would I think we would stop being friends. People always tell me that I'm the nicest, most thoughtful and caring person they know, but everyday I wake up and feel like I'm the worst person in the world. It has really been eating me up on the inside. I lost a friend because of the mistakes I made. IVE NEVER LOST A FRIEND BEFORE THIS. The same week of the incident, a couple mutual friends came up to me regarding the messages, which triggered my anxiety to a whole new level. I felt betrayed that the private messages I sent while intoxicated were exposed and now god knows how many people know about them. I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped going out, deleted social media and have isolated myself and I don't plan on going back. My anxiety has skyrocketed and I just have been avoiding everyone. (all of this was months before the pandemic).

I know everything I did is inexcusable and I guess this is a way of punishing myself for it. The suicidal ideation remain. I am embarrassed. I am regretful. I am remorseful. Even if she forgives in the future, I   wouldn't want her to see me again. I just want everyone to forget I exist and disappear."
1,I’m a Loser.. I feel like a Loser like Beck says. Anyone else feeling like that way right now?
1,"I love sleeping, but right now I don't want to. I don't want to sleep because that means the day is over. Another day wasted. Another day filled with missed opportunities. All the time in the world and doing nothing with it. It's just an endless cycle of not wanting to do anything and hating the fact that I never do anything. When I wake up tomorrow, my first feeling will be anger. Anger towards myself for not having used the previous day in a way that's productive, and anger over the realization that this day will end the same way. It always ends like this. With boredom, anger and self-loathing. It's not fun, it's not interesting, and it's not helpful to anyone. It just sucks."

1,"Does anyone else get depressed when they are have time off school/work. I ever since a couple of years ago have gotten depressed every single time i have had time of school. As an example, we had this week of for easter and my mental health wasn’t that good to begin with but it got double as bad now.

Every single day is a progressive cycle of depression, i wake up ok but it gets worse during the day until i go to bed which will be at the worst its at (im at that point right now) and the cycle repeats."
1,"I feel like a goddamned failure. I'm a dude in my early 30s. Have bachelor and master degrees. Have overcome a lot of mental health problems in my life, though depression still plagues me. 

I've been trying to climb the socioeconomic ladder and break into a career that I actually care about (healthcare, specifically mental healthcare). Was suddenly laid off last month because the market tanked and COVID-19 spread.

I've lived somewhat frugally, though much to my self-imposed embarrassment. Like, I'm still renting a shitty apartment in a low-income-high-crime area of town. Most of my friends have single-family homes/houses/condos. 

I've tried to pivot and learn computer programming (Python and Java), but I do not have the aptitude for it. 

I don't know, I just feel like that by now at my age, things wouldn't be so difficult, that I would be struggling so much still (financially and career), and that I'd have *something* to show for the effort I've put into life. 

I'm so fucking tired of struggling and failing and being at the whims of a system that is inherently stacked against the common working person. I feel like I'm being punished but have no clue as to what I did wrong.

And I feel horrible. I can't control myself and I hurt her when i don't want to. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place, but I don't feel my best. I have a video chat with my therapist tomorrow, but I havent felt good. Not in a long time. I can barely work or focus on anything, and I latch onto anything to do that will make me feel better. I even spent 200 dollars on a charcuterie board during one of my moods the other day. I dont know why, because it gave me something to do. I dont want anyone to talk to.

Now at 36 I was going to go back to school but now I realize that all of the good jobs out there are stem jobs which I suck at.

I graduated from college in 2008 when the recession hit and now in 2020 we are seeing another recession just as I'm trying to get back on my feet. I've been sucking down alcohol for the last 2 hours and now my only wish is that God takes me out of this hell we call life."

I don't really have an appetite anymore but if I don't eat then I become really weak and shaky and I feel like I'm dying (I think I may be hypoglycemic). I feel horrible all the time and I wish I was gone so I don't have to suffer like this anymore.

I'm trying to keep up as best as possible even with the minimal amount of training I received, yet I'm still expected to know each and every detail on the menu or the exact addresses of locations we don't deliver to.

It's only been one week since I started working there, and I want to die. I'm hoping to just grin and bear their bullshit while trying to find a new job, though I honestly just want to resign tomorrow and recover from the after-effects of enduring such a toxic environment. I just can't allow myself to be driven to insanity for the sake of minimum wage, as I'm not going to tolerate maltreatment from anyone.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, and for my dissertation I am investigating how instagram use affects mood.  Current research is conflicted as to the effects of social media, and oftentimes research is done cross-sectionally and not in the immediate sense.  I am hoping to change this with my research, and better understand the immediate link between using Instagram and mood across a range of participants.

I am currently recruiting research participants who are between the ages of 18-35, use Instagram at least once every other day, and can complete phone surveys on their smartphones multiple times a day.

If you are interested in participating, it would be a huge help to our team.  The study will take one week, will involve filling out surveys on your own smartphone, and you will be compensated up to **$70.00** in Amazon gift cards for participating in all portions of the study. There will be no direct benefit to participants.

I don’t understand how to talk to people and I really don’t have anything to say to them. I have nothing to look forward to everyday, and I have no goals.

For those of you who responded to my last post, thank you for your kindness, for those who asked for my story, thank you. I really like being in this subreddit, even though I never post and I don't really talk, should anyone want I could write my story *maybe* share it publicly, but it's very unlikely. 

Anyways, I've wanted to post an update for awhile now, but I wanted to be sure that this ""calm state of mind"" would stick around for longer, although yesterday was bad and today isn't the best, I have been feeling less sad lately, which is a major improvement to how I have been feeling as of late, and maybe that's because this is just the eye of the storm but I hope that this stays for awhile, because I could get used to feeling like I'm whole without having to have someone tell me that I'm not broken... my point is that it's nice.

I really wanted to write this update because something really good happened, something that put some stuff into perspective for me: something I used to do in the past is causing me joy. I won't say what that activity is, because that doesn't matter. But everything I used to like brings me a feeling of sad, because I've changed as a person. I'm not vibrant anymore, but this thing... it makes me feel vibrant, and I think I see the sliver of hope returning. It's been so long since I've last felt hope.. for anything. 

I also wanted to add that for the first time in years, I let my guard down. I really feel like making more friends has given me more confidence and that maybe this could be the start of a positive life for me. Again, thank you to those who reached out and asked me what I was going through, I hope that this will bring some closure to those who have thought about what happened to me. I truly hope that this calmness sticks around for a long time and that I can spread it and make someone's  life better at some point. 

Thank you for reading,

1,"This is the toughest test we are all going to face!!. Hello there fellow redditors,
I have been on this sub-reddit for a minute and lately, I’ve been reading too much that Covid stay-at-home has gotten everyone peaking on stupid thoughts(that is what I call my depression and anxiety). 

I (23M) have been in US for roughly about 2 years. And, I’ve literally wasted one and half year over my ex who initially said she wanted to be with me and but it ain’t worthwhile for her to join me here. Life was getting good after crazy depression and anxiety to a point that my chest would literally hurt like its bursting out. But, covid hit the planet and caused devastating loss and pain for everyone involved.

I don’t want to tell the world how I had fight my thoughts but what I want to show the world how I made it out and now that I’m at top, no one can stop me anymore.

I know everyone on the thread wants to share the story of what is bothering them but we are going to tell the world how we made it to top!! 

I have made myself a realistic routine and set of goals that can be achieved and set me on a path to greatness! I am open to share everything with whoever is interested and I hope you also join me on my journey and get yourself out like how I will!! 

Thank you and have an awesome day!!"
1,"I [M 21] have depression that started 1.5 months into my relationship with my girlfriend [F 18] and I fear I'm falling out of love.. Sorry. This is a crosspost from RA but since no one responded in two hours I thought this might be a better place to ask... sorry!



Hello there,

Around the beginning of March, toward one of the nights, I was hanging out with my girlfriend and a friend, when suddenly a wall of anxiety hit me. (Do I love her? Should I break up with her??) Out of nowhere. I've never had a problem like this before. We talked about it, she said she wasn't really sure. She said she'd support me no matter what, I've started medication and started seeing a therapist. She's the most caring and kind person I've ever met, she's meeting my every need, and she's doing everything she can to make sure I know she loves me and she supports my journey. We are long distance unfortuntately, which isn't the end goal, but, important to mention, we want to meet and go on a date in August.

It feels like there's a part of me that's convinced I don't love her at all, and that I should break it off to save her the pain. But I don't want to, it's a sort of internal conflict. I legitimately cannot tell if I'm falling out of love or if I'm just dealing with depression and the remnants of being quickly and harshly dumped by my previous girlfriends. (Probably has something to do with it) I'm so desperate to stay with her and support her and yet it feels like every time we're just talking, and I have a thought like ""you don't love her"" it's all i can think about for the next couple hours. It's no doubt taking a toll on our relationship which is why I want to fix it so badly. I've never wanted to be fixed for anyone before. She is worth it. But I'm so terrified I'm in denial, sometimes we talk but I can't feel anything for her, then my anxiety kicks up to convince me I don't love her. It's terrifying. Everything triggers fear.

The reason I'm making this post is because last night I nearly had a breakdown at my own thought process. She asked me, as a thought exercise, if she thought ""the thought of her with someone else upsets me, or losing her upsets me"" and it didn't, in that moment. Which made me feel like complete and utter shit.

Then, today, we continued talking about what happened last night, trying to figure out happened, we played animal crossing, and it was nice. I felt comfy.

She asked me, a couple hours later, if I thought a break might help. I got scared, I felt terrified, scared, I didn't want to lose her, I wanted to cling to her and never let go.

I'm so scared and confused and I don't know what to do. My therapist has ignored me for 3 weeks after my first meeting with her and I haven't had anyone to bounce these thoughts off of except my poor girlfriend who is doing SO MUCH to help me through this.

Please let me know what you think.

TL;DR, I cannot tell if I love my girlfriend anymore and I'm terrified."
1,"Idk just a stupid ass vent. I feel like I’m really close to killing myself but I really shouldn’t be because I’ve still got quite a lot of my life left, I don’t deserve to live that life tho. I’m disgusting and such a fat ass the only thing I do when I get really low is fucking eat and that’s all I do but I just can’t fucking stop and it hurts because I KNOW I’m doing this to myself and it’s only my fault but it still hurts and I feel trapped in a cycle of slowly ruining my life further

I made a promise to myself that if I was still like this at 16 I’m gonna kill myself but honestly...I think that’s gonna happen much sooner now, it’s not just eating either I’m a horrible selfish asshole that is lazy and I used to put so much effort into making other happy even if it made me sad but I just don’t care anymore. I just want to stop feeling like this every fucking day and I’m terrified of going back to school because then there won’t be an excuse to be like this and other people will start to see my failing but I don’t want to bother them with my life or existing anymore."
1,"I’m surrounded by family yet I’ve never felt so lonely and isolated.. This quarantine is my own personal hell. For the past two years I basically shut myself away with my ex and some of the stuff we went through sucked but she made it all worth it. Then right before covid struck she completely ghosted me and ran off to Omaha with some dude and called me a liar, manipulator, and said I held her back the entire time. My brother that I trusted with literally anything completely agreed with her on everything even though he saw the way I worshipped the ground she walked on. He’s apologized but it’ll never be the same, he keeps trying to respark what we had before and it isn’t there. Because of this I had to move back in with my grandparents and I love them so much but their health is failing both physically and mentally and it’s really hard not to completely shatter and fall apart. I can’t go out and meet some new people with this, all I can do is watch what family I have left wither away slowly and it’s killing me. The girl I loved so much walked away, my brother I thought I could trust with my life backstabbed me, and my reward is watching my remaining relatives waste away in a chair talking incoherently what they saw on fb. It’s so hard to keep moving on through these ashes."
1,My mom ruins my mood. Today I woke up ready to take care of myself I washed all my clothes getting ready for my interview tomorrow and my mood was somewhat good. Then my mom yells my name and she goes of ranting to me about how I’m ungrateful and how I look high and how I’m fake. I’m tired of hearing this shit. I don’t hate my mom but it puts me in a bad mood
1,"Anyone else have issues with Walgreens delivery for meds?. I got an alert back on 4/2 to renew a delivery prescription. I never heard back via email or text on the status. I've been on the phone with them since Saturday, and depending who I talk to, I get different answers. I was told they were done processing and would be shipped over night. Then I was told they were out of one med. When I asked why I didn't get a notification of that, she said, ""We have millions of customers, we can't notify people."" To which I asked why Walgreens doesn't embrace automation like every other business. I got told a different story each time and I have devoted 10+ hours to this. At one point they told me I should just go to a local Walgreens and pick it up. Nope. I have at risk family members and signed up for delivery for this reason. 

I have no idea if I will ever see my meds and I will be going through withdrawals if I don't. I know delivery pharmacies are slammed right now, but denying people meds is criminal. I was rudely told they they are at least 3 weeks behind and I should have placed the order sooner (you can't refill sooner than a certain time so this isn't possible.)

Anyone else having problems getting meds?"
1,"I love the feeling of being drunk.. I drink from my parents' alcohol collection, and I have to drink super heavy to actually get truly drunk. I take a couple of shots and just sit giddily awaiting my tipsiness. Once it hits, I swing around and laugh like a maniac at whatever I see. I do this maybe twice a month? This sounds bs but I love writing, and when I'm drunk, I'm much able to relive the story thats on the paper and continue bringing new scenes. Somehow my work when sober and my work under the influence is like night and day. I get drunk just enough so I know what I'm doing. I have never had a hangover,even when I got blackout drunk. I hate social drinking because I fear of being taken advantage of, even if I'm tipsy I know I'm not fully cooperative, aka I prefer drinking alone in the dark. I wish my tipsiness pasted more than an hour, no matter how hard I drink... drinking makes me happier, and helps me spend my sleepless nights writing or being drunkenly positive, otherwise I would be a crying moron looking outside my window at the fluttering leaves. This is turning into a problem because no one drinks in the house and the liquor is disappearing...."
1,"Isolation Post Breakup - Brings Back Old Feelings of Hoplessness.. My own company is my worst company. Im sure a lot of people here are feeling the impact of this. I can't forget my problems by going to work, I have very few friends and none that I'm connected with in such a way that I can talk freely about my headspace, and living alone intensifies everything. 

For some background, I was diagnosed with pure O OCD, and PTSD from a number of things happening in a space of 12 months (nothing overly dramatic; a breakup, pet dying then mother dying). I regularly find my mind spinning back into old habits, intrusive thoughts batter me and I'm left empty, broken and full of loathing for myself.

I had a breakup a few weeks before the quarantine started, and I've picked this old mental scab until it bled. I've acutely self aware, I really wish I wasn't. My recent ex was very interested in personality types, and through her I learned that I fit quite well into the INTP bracket, which makes sense.

I'm rambling; I just feel so alone."
1,"Why does she insist on fucking with me?. My ex, who already ruined my head, continues to fuck with me. I can't wrap my head around what it wrong with her.

She broke up with me because she was cheating on me (for the 3rd time) but she ended it in January. Yes, I know why didn't I end it a long time ago? I'm a push over and let her walk all over me. Even now I still love her even though I know she has some mental problems. It's been 3 months. 

She lied that I broke into her house (while she accused me of many other things, that was the one that got her enough to get a pfa against me, and I never got to tell my side of the story in court. Also, the name of the house is still in both of ours, and I allowed her to have the house for her and my daughter) but either a stranger did it, or the more likely scenario is her or her new scumbag boyfriend(who I don't trust around my daughter at all) did it to try to get me out of their 
 life so I couldn't pick up my daughter by myself and not allow me to grab my things from the house.  

Also, shout out to that boyfriend who tried to make fun of me for living with my parents. Hey, you dumb fucker, i just gave you a house to live in, that's still in my name, and that slut you are living with is the reason I had to move back in with my parents 

Anywho, when the pandemic started she and him decided to plan a flight somewhere, knowing full well what is happening in the world. She did finally cancel it after she got laid off and had the stay at home order in place. But she was already willing to risk her health and possibly come back sick to our daughter, just to be with her new shitty boyfriend. Because she doesn't care about our daughter.

Then last Thursday, she said she can't keep our daughter for Friday(which was the plan). Because she has ""plans"". Things are fucking closed, you shouldn't have plans for anything. So I kept my daughter for over 4 days because of her negligence. We had a deal to split our daughters time 3.5 days a week. Which I'm fine with.

NOW, today I find out she suddenly wants to keep our daughter until Saturday. 6 fucking days. When I was supposed to get her this Thursday. Of course I can't do anything. I can't talk to her and ask her why. She can only talk to my mom. So something is fucky and I don't even get an explanation. My mom won't ask her because she's tired of being in the middle. But I deserve to see my daughter. I actually love her and give her all my attention. Suddenly this neglectful person wants to spend time with our daughter? Doubtful. She's been fucking with me for years. And she managed to make a pfa happen so I can't even check in to make sure things are ok, to make sure my daughter is safe. She's breaking all this social distancing stuff because she has no care in the world. Because she doesn't care about anything. 

I've had depression for years, but since January, this shit is out of control. She's pressing buttons that's shouldn't be pressed. And everyone believes her because she is the mom, the girl, and I have no say over anything. And I don't know how much more I can take. My brain feels broken. And I want her to feel like I do. She deserves being mentally broken.

Maybe this rant deserves to go elsewhere, I don't know. But I'm a fucking mess right now."

 my creativity is gone thanks to work. i dont even want to draw anymore. i used to be super into drawing but its gone now. i wasnt good at it, i suppose it was just to vent out my feelings. now that thats gone idek what to do anymore besides post here n hope for replies ig."

This is exactly the type of shit that makes me wonder if anyone cares at all. Friends say they care about you and then when the time comes, nothing. I don't get what was wrong that made them ignore the tweet.

I recently came to this point in my life where I no longer no how to handle things anymore... there are just so many things in my head dragging me down.

I once had a very good paying job but I left it because it destroyed me mentally only to be left with having to start over in a new branch and now all my friends around me are high paid workers with nice jobs and I have to work my ass off for a minimum wage.

I lost my old flat and had to go into debs to get a new one.

I have a wonderful boyfriend who tries his best to make me fell loved and supports me in so many way but sometimes I am afraid he’s gonna get bored or overwhelmed with me and will leave me.

I come from a big family with 8 siblings where I always felt like I was the least successful, the least beautiful and the least intelligent one. I always had this feeling to let my mom down, like I never did anything she could be proud of.

It’s just I feel like such a worthless human being.. like everyone around me is so amazing and beautiful and wonderful and I .. I am just the outsider.. the ugly one ..the untalented, dumb and worthless one.

The gay son who will never give my mom a grandchild, the childish guy who can never be a full grown adult, the dumb guy who never went for a higher education, the mediocre guy who hasn’t got any talent for anything, the one guy who got many friends but no true friend, the guy who just wants to be loved but is afraid he can’t give enough love to his boyfriend ... and at this moment this guy just needs someone to tell him that his worth living

I have been drunk before so that's why it kinda got me thinking that she might get a little dizzy but what bothers me is that she's like that everyday and even in public(which is really embarrazing).

Even less so at night, but much less so during these times. Yet I have been woken up a in the middle of the night to police or ambulance sirens several times. I just heard police sirens again at about 11 o’ clock this evening, while there are very very few locals on the road at this time of night.

My thought is that sirens were meant to allow traffic to know an emergency vehicle is coming down the road so that they could move out of the way. If there is no traffic in the middle of the night, why do people driving emergency vehicles turn the sirens on? 

I feel like I’m missing something here. I guess my simple question is why is the only thing that is breaking the silence here emergency vehicles sirens?"

0,"What is it with brides forcing the bridesmaids to wear the same dresses or colours? Can someone explain to me why a person would care that much about people‘s dressing choices?. I live in germany and am planning our wedding for nex year - and I follow some of the reddit threads which deal with weddings and bridezillas. 

I often read about brides forcing their guests in specific outfits, making them cover up their tattoos, feeling the need to dictate the hairstyle an so on.

As we do not have these traditions in germany, it sounds so so very weird to me to care that much how my wedding guests would look.


I mean, I anticipate that people would dress decently and mind the dresscode, but it would drive me CRAZY to be involved in the specifics of every single decision regarding their appearances.


So can someone explain to me why brides from the countries with this traditions care that much? Are the wedding pictures really that important? Because where I live, the most importand puctures are of the bride and groom together, and a group picture of ALL guests. So nobody gives a f*ck who is wearing what."

They had to set up a place for me to sit. I didn't have a name card. It was a nice seated dinner. I was mortified and embarrassed that he was that ignorant and that I blindly trusted that I was invited (We'd only been together a few weeks). His logic was that if you're invited to a wedding you automatically get to bring a date. After that debacle, he told me he was bringing me to yet another wedding, and this time I asked him to confirm with the bride first about plus ones... And he chose to ask her at a large group dinner instead of privately. He put her on the spot and she had to tell him I wasn't invited to my face in front of everyone else, who was invited. That relationship obviously did not last long, and I cringe about this memory every time wedding invites come up in conversation."

There are also instances of forging consent forms in India to proceed with trials.

I was doing quite fine, one day, and then I take out my phone; and I just do not know how to get to the menu.

Handed over my phone to my friend, and they showed me. And the memory re-appeared (or at least that's how I'm trying to convince myself as); I get worried thinking this might happen for other things. 

The only other incident somewhat resembling this is, when I was 4/5 years old, I forgot how to cross my arms; and even to this day i feel like i look weird crossing my arm (reminded of my horror when i felt like i couldn't do it right) - have taken surveys and my mom says it looks normal and it certainly does but i just feel like an imposter.

This company does a lot of shady stuff having worked for them as a teenager I try to stay far far away from here.

However millions of presale are tied up/spent in unknown ways and the company is refusing any refunds, ever. 

Feel free to call and workshop being a season pass holder; they are doing no documentation of calls and I would allege have no way of refunding the money they spent.

This is their latest tactic to block anyone asking about refunds or now argue with us they don’t have the resources.

These guys rent cattle to put in the employee lot to classify the land as agriculture; family has exotic pets as “zoo exhibits” on the park.

0,"Heightened Sense of Reality at a young age ... Hello, I’m 15 going on 16 and here’s a problem that’s haunted me the entirety of my life at this point. 

Some background, I grew up in an old town in New York. My mother has raised me right and taught me right from wrong which translates how I treat people with respect to this day. I have one sister that has a mental disability that can’t care for herself and doesn’t have the development past 2 years old. My biological father left me at a young age but I know true to myself that didn’t have any effect on me. I have known my, now, stepdad since 2012-13 so about when I was 8-9. 

Around the age of 6, maybe 7, I noticed that I wouldn’t enjoy childhood activities like other kids would. I’d have negative thoughts of reality and the dark truth of the world didn’t seem to effect my friends. I’d always put it away and just act like they would but whenever family or friends would bring me somewhere, there’d always be someone there or something there that would make me feel bad. I was observant so that could stem out to present-day where I can find a motive for a good majority of what everyone does. I’d cry myself to sleep over these bad thoughts and I unknowingly taught myself the first few years to occupy myself to distract my isolated mind. Again, due to not having a sibling that I could necessarily interact with at my age, I’d have some time to myself. I got attention from my parents and received normal care. This time to myself would be nightmarish. Total isolation in my mind and I’d be stuck on things that had happened days, weeks, months ago and think; “why did this person act like this?” or “Why can’t I be happy like everyone else?”. Again, I’d counter this by occupying myself.

A few years pass and I move to California when I was a few months away from turning 10 and I still have this issues. Around this time, to me it was like “alright, these thoughts will go away when I’m older”. Nothing new for the next few years. When I got into 7th grade is when it was different, except I realized the thoughts were something everyone would have if they were idiotic enough to overthink things like myself. But now it was something different, I realized so many were so distanced from reality. Here I am, 10th grade spending half of it in quarantine having these godawful thoughts more and more with time to myself. I still feel now that people don’t have the same sense of reality as I do but I don’t speak of it to anyone because it feels as if it’s a curse. I am a sympathetic person and that would explain why I’d feel gloomy if I’d think about something bad happening. I feel so much more awake then everyone else, I know other people are intelligent but I don’t know what my issue is that I am more aware of everything around me. Everything including personality, ways people respond to events, etc. Any help or recommendation to another subreddit would be great. Thanks for your time."
0,"How old are you and how many times have you been in love?. I (F21) have been in love twice. First time I was 16, I knew I loved him when I first laid eyes on him. We became close later because of mutual friends, ended up messing around on and off for years. Eventually got caught up in the wrong crowd after high school and started doing meth and heroin, cheating and I found out later that he slept with someone I considered a friend at the time. Although we never “officially dated” (we would hangout everyday, sleep together, it was kinda known we were a thing) and he was a total dick , it kinda sucks knowing that was my first love. It started off so innocent and he let life turn him ugly. Seeing him turn into an addict and treat me so horribly changed me and the way I love. I haven’t dated for years since then until now. Which is my 2nd love, and he is wonderful and makes me the happiest I’ve been in a while. He gives me that movie kind of love, if we were in the 80’s he’d probably throw rocks on my window with a stereo kinda love. It’s just hard to love the way I once did. Now I feel like I have so many cages over my heart and it takes a lot more fear and effort to open up and love deeply again, but I’m really trying."
0,"People with a DVD collection - do you ever look at your movies and rediscover old favorites or wonder why you liked some enough to buy?. I have maybe 200 DVDs, (kind of small for a movie enthusiast I guess). Like most, I stream more than anything nowadays. But if I cant rent some old favorite off of Amazon, I go to my shelf and pop one in. It’s almost like using a vinyl record at this point.

I have favorites that have always been my faves, but some are also ones I rarely rewatch. Some I felt a strong connection to the movie when I bought it, and forget how good it is when I watch it every 5-7 years or so. And then some for special occasions or some that meant a lot to me as a teenager.

Do you have any you thought you loved but now cant get into the right mood to watch? Movies like Schindler’s List or Blood Diamond or documentaries that really moved you? You talk about them to others and recommend them, but havent even seen it again in 10-20 years? 

Do you have a special feature you love to watch? Not the movie, but maybe theres a really long special feature thats just as enjoyable? Or maybe its just easier to pop a DVD in and choose a special feature, rather than stream and have to fast forward to special features?"

This is my first question here.
I met a girl on omegle, we instantly hit it off and exchanged snapchat ids. Both of us had anonymous ids on Snapchat, because you dont know what kind of people you meet online. 
Anyways, we spoke for a few days and were really in to each other. Then I got busy with work and didnt really get the time to answer her messages on Snapchat. Long story short, when I checked my snapchat a few days later, I found out that she'd deleted her anonymous account. Have been trying to find her since then. 
The info I have is her first name (i'm not sure if it's real or not), where she studied and the city she lives in since we discussed that. 
My mistake was that I didnt ask her for a real contact (which I wouldve gotten easily) since she asked for mine at the start but I told her it's too early to trust her.
I cant find her on any social media from her first name and the info I have.
Can anyone suggest any people searching services that are free or can anyone from related fields help me out please? 
For the second case, I would only share the info with someone who's a proffesional and genuinely intrested to help me out, I would be very grateful for your help and advice."

About a month ago I drove home truly thinking I was fine to drive until I saw lights behind me. I blew .094 and was charged with an OWI first. 

I had my initial hearing and pled not guilty per the advice of a lawyer consult. I let them know I felt one of the field sobriety tests should be disregarded since my shoe was broken, so I took it off and took the test barefoot and it also cold, so I was shaking badly. I took the breathalyzer at approx 3:30am          (.094) and the blood test was .091 (taken about 4:10am)

I have a call with the DA at the end of the month. Is there anything I can tell him or show him to possibly lessen the charges? or have my name taken off ccap? 

I'm looking at 6 months of a suspended license, required AODA class, an $810 fine, and obviously it being on my record. Someone who called me after the hearing said the owi will be public on ccap for LIFE. Is this true? (The case is on ccap currently. I have nothing else on my record)

I would continue to work with a lawyer but didn't secure one and with the current pandemic I don't have many options. I'll continue to try though. I've also been told that WI very rarely drops these charges...."

He believes that 5G spreads Corona virus (or any disease that the government wants to spread) and is truly scared of mandatory vaccination due to being microchipped. He furthermore claims that Tom Hanks is in prison and shit like that.

I know a lot of people will just say ""Stop talking to him"" but I don't want to do that. I would like to help him but at the same time he wants to ""help me"" to ""wake up"". I just can't reach him.

Everytime I tell him how stupid this is he says that my sources are just state propaganda. Yet he believes some garbage that was posted on 4chan. For two weeks now he claims the internet will shut down ""tomorrow"" to bring complete chaos and there will be a prepared TV program to keep the public under control.

0,"Profit hospitals need inspiration on why profits are not as important as staff safety.. 

9 RNs talked to the press tonight, frm Rmc &amp; MMC. 
We talked about needs for: PPE, communication re: exposure incidents, &amp; need to put exposed staff on precautionary paid quarantines.

WATCH;
We may be on: Fox 41 at 10pm, KCTV 5, KMBC, MSNBC/Chris Hays, NPR (radio &amp; web), KC Star web &amp; Sunday.

HCA got mad &amp; put out a testy statement in response. Here is our response to that. 
 
NNU’s Response to HCA Midwest Health:
 
It is disappointing that in the midst of an exploding global and national pandemic that HCA Midwest Health would choose to accuse its registered nurses of spreading “confusion, misinformation and fear” while they are putting their own health and safety on the front lines every day to protect HCA patients.
 
What has become reported throughout the world is that nurses and other health care workers are at disproportionate risk for the novel coronavirus infection, and spreading the infection to patients, their co-workers, and their own families. And what has become tragically reported is that nurses and other healthcare workers, have in disproportionate numbers, become sickened with COVID-19, become patients themselves relying on ventilators to breathe, and dying.
 
What the scientific evidence has demonstrated is that the “standard face masks”  HCA Midwest Health touts are not sufficient to protect nurses and other health care workers who have been exposed to suspected infected patients. Inadequate protection is the leading reason why so many health care workers have become infected, including in hospitals across the U.S.
 
Reliance on CDC guidelines, at a time when the CDC almost daily has continued to retreat on its guideline standards for health care workers and other safety measures, is a prescription for disaster. We have seen too many hospitals engage in a race to the bottom that will do nothing to slow, much less stop, the spread of the virus and mitigate this calamity.
 
It is important to note that CDC guidelines are merely recommendations, not a mandate. Hospitals that want to truly protect its caregivers and patients should be going above and beyond limited guidelines to assure maximum protection for the communities they serve.
 
We also reject the contention by HCA Midwest Health that the virus is spread solely by droplets. There is increasing evidence now of aerosol transmission of the virus which provides further reason for ensuring the maximum personal protective equipment in all hospitals, including those operated by HCA Midwest Health.
 
Finally, the argument that HCA Midwest Health cannot fully provide N95 respirators because it would “exceed the ability of suppliers to manufacture PPE” is specious. As the most profitable hospital system in the country, HCA has ample finances to acquire all the N95 respirators and other optimal protective equipment that its nurses and other healthcare workers need to protect themselves and their patients.
 
If HCA would like to see the increased national production of N95 respiratory masks, we invite HCA to join NNU in demanding that President Trump invoke his authority under the Defense Production Act to direct domestic manufactures to rapidly mass produce the millions of N95s, and even the more effective Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) this crisis demands."

It happened again a couple months ago, an older woman at work asked me where I’m from, again, because of my “accent.”

I’ve recorded myself speaking on a few occasions since then and I DO pronounce certain words with an accent and I have no idea how or why. It sounds normal in my head (for example, teabag becomes tea “beg,” lamp becomes “leamp”)

I didn’t grow up around anyone with an accent or anyone who speaks like this. It made me really self-conscious and I’ve been dwelling on this way too much. What’s wrong with me?"

0,"How can I get help without needing my parents?. I’m scared that people are going to come for me because I’m self diagnosing so just a disclaimer: I believe I am depressed but I have not been clinically diagnosed.

I’ve been so sad for so long and contemplating suicide since I was in the 4th grade. My mom runs things around my house and she is definitely not supportive. She is one of those people who thinks your problems are invalid because she has worse ones. After a particularly bad breakdown one day I confided in my dad that I wanted to kill myself. He was very understanding, promised me therapy, and said he would talk to my mom about it. It has been 4 months and nothing has been said about it and they haven’t brought it up. I know that they’re just avoiding it and there’s no use bringing it up again. After a fight with my dad I was having a panic/anxiety attack or mental breakdown of some sort where I was just scratching the skin off of my arms. They were bleeding a lot and I wasn’t even aware I was doing it. My dad saw and just said “[Mom] she’s hurting herself” and my mom just rolled her eyes and my dad walked away and didn’t check on me after that. There’s no use in trying to get them to take action so i want to take action myself. What can I do?"

0,"How does Reddit ensure that all the porn uploaded to it only features adults?. Porn threads have only recently started coming into my r/all feed, thanks algorithm.

The thread admins seem to check that the poster is the person in the pic, which is great, but don’t mention age verification. I reported one video which appeared to have a large chested girl who looked about 15 years old. The report was closed with a “this is fine” but with no allusion to how that was verified. There are also many videos that have body parts of people whose faces are not shown, how can those possibly be age verified!

I like reddit but I want no part in a system that lets underage porn proliferate. I’ve google searched how reddit verifies the age of people in uploaded porn with no success so thought it best to ask here."

0,"How come in performing arts and sports where the athletes spin, they do a bunch of boring stuff before getting to the good stuff?. For example, in breakdancing they do this weird hopscotch thing with their feet while being all like ""What's good? You want some of this?"" with their hands.

In pole dancing they'll like dance next to the pole and lean on it and stuff. Roll around on the ground and stuff.

In gymnastics they do a lot of pointy foot posing while arching their back like a cat, and do some half hearted dancing.

In ice-skating, it's similar to gymnastics, but they try harder to dance good in between the spinning, and I think they do a good job. I don't begrudge the ice skaters as much because often the dancing is very good.

I have more examples, but I think I've made my point. Why the boring build-ups with no spinning?"

0,"Friendship Woes. Ok so I’ve known this guy since we were in middle school. I introduced him to the company I work for and he’s come to surpass my personal success and join the corporate team. The thing is, I really don’t care about all of that. We’re relatively young (22-23) and he has a habit of drinking a lot (and ignoring me) to hang out with a friend of ours who is also on the corporate team. Usually when said friend has to go out of town he’ll hang out with me, which I try not to take offense to since I have a kid and I can’t day drink like they can. But, recently a different friend of ours has reached legal drinking age, and ever since then I can’t get him to hang out with me. I see him at work and ask if he wants to hang and he gives me some vague excuse. Any days I have off I see  him hanging with said “barely legal” friend or the other corporate one. He tries to pull the “I miss you!! I wish you could’ve been there!” Thing and I’ve brought up how he never invites me to things anymore. I don’t want to be a bitch but I feel really hurt that my oldest friend is so quick to replace me. How can/should I confront him? 

TLDR: My friend has been blowing me off for newer options, I don’t know how to tell him that sucks"

Read this article recommended by Bill Gates, who over the last twenty years turned himself from one of the world’s best programmers and best businessman, into one of the world’s lead foremost authority on disease. https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?linkId=85439737.

If we can use our prowess to get out the message that the globe must unite or tens of millions of people could die, we have the potential to save many lives. Governments need to get billions of tests made and distributed, million of ventilators built worldwide, tens of billions of masks built, comprehensive tracing and tracking of those who have been infected, and most importantly a massive logistics effort to bring help to whichever areas are seeing the worst outbreaks. People worldwide need to work to understand the virus and what they personally can do to fight it.

This is the most important time of our lives, and we need to bring our very best efforts.

If you have good ideas to get the message out, please share here… And don’t stop there, tell everyone you know."

0,"might be falling for a close friend. using a throwaway for privacy. so a few months ago, i met a girl in class (university) and found her attractive. we talked for a couple days and i was planning on asking her out, but she caught on to my advances and told me she has a boyfriend (with some very vague indications she was not happy with him). so at this point i was like ok no problem, it was just a basic attraction so i can be friends with this girl. we both really enjoy being around each other and are basically the same person personality-wise (other than me having more confidence). weve gotten so close over the past few months very gradually at first but now we see each other at least 3 times a week. i make her laugh so hard she almost pees herself, and she comes over often to drink and just listen to music and talk (its been strictly platonic other than flirty shoulder punches and shit like that). i know the first thought is gonna be “if shes comfortable doing this to him then she’ll do it to you too” but clearly if she wasnt loyal she would have made a move by now or taken me up on my date in the first place. i get the feeling that shes into me, but the problem is shes very insecure and has opened up about it to me before. she is not at all happy in her current relationship which has been deteriorating even longer than i’ve known her. she is scared to leave him because she thinks no one will date her, legitimately, she has explained its not fishing for compliments either. her bf is a complete fuckup just from hearing her complaints about him, but he has her manipulated via guilt to stay in the relationship. he tells her “youre gonna have to break up with me because i love you more than you love me”.

so anyways i had been holding my tongue as i kept developing stronger feelings, and i am definitely no homewrecker. but as a very empathetic person hearing this got me to tell her that i would date her if she was single, because as someone who used to be very insecure she deserved to know that. she seemed really surprised at first and then smiled and said i’ll definitely keep that in mind. and this was earlier this week. she regularly talks about her bf in a negative way and is in a long distance relationship with him. as long as ive known her she has gone to see him twice and he has never bothered to come up and see her. as i mentioned before she is VERY shy so i dont think she would outright say she has feelings for me especially in a relationship, but i am confident there is definitely at least some interest. i’m not here to play the waiting game i just genuinely love spending time with her and have gained some mutual friends out of knowing her as well. that being said, i’m starting to fall for her pretty hard. this doesnt take away from the times we hangout and how much fun we have, but its been starting to be on my mind more recently. as of now, my feelings arent strong enough to justify cutting her out, but the hourglass has definitely started. not so much looking for advice as i am insight. what would you do in my situation?


TLDR: was attracted to a girl in an unfulfilling long distance relationship. thought i could keep it platonic but am starting to catch feelings. almost certain she is into me as well, but is very insecure about leaving her bf. told her i would date her recently to see if the dynamic changes in the coming weeks"
0,"People who were already going through something difficult, how are you coping with it now with Covid, social distancing and all this change?. My bf of 3 years just broke up with me on our anniversary, a week before we knew Covid would become what it has. I didn’t see the break up coming, I actually thought he was going to propose. So before all that was happening, I was deeply heart broken. I don’t feel safe moving out when my country is on lockdown, I can’t go to work to get space or do what makes me feel good and I can’t be with my friends and family who would otherwise help me. It’s sucks. It’s very hard to process and begin to move on, even harder than it would have already been if it weren’t for Covid!

0,"tired of hurting people need ideas. hey, so im 25 yr old guy and 6 months ago broke up from an on/off 7 year relationship and now im kind of together with a japanese girl for a month or so but the last week i am very annoyed by every move she makes and i lost all physical interest. So let me explain, she is sweet and smart and very intelligent but she does not make ANY effort to being a “sexy” woman or a woman at all. Like i dont want to sound arrogant but i like the simple things like cute underwear or even a bit of makeup because i have always been around “hot” girls or girls who make an effort being hot. And its the norm for me. When i started dating her i promised to myself that i wont go for “hot” looks anymore and rather go for the person but fuck now im in a point again where i lost my interest because of the reason above. Should i stop lying to myself and just say that im not interested and move on ? Like i dont want to brag but i am kind of an 9/10 tall very artsy musical guy with tattoos and good looking so i would rly have no problem finding girls but IM SO SICK of hurting girls because i lose physical interest in them so quickly. And i am always looking for more.

I made this post pretty rushed and under influence of wine and listening to freddie dredd so excuse my cynicality.

0,"Should I warn my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend about how he acts?. First time post, and apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit. I recently found out from someone who knows my ex-boyfriend (who I dumped over a year ago after 9 months of dating) that he's dating a new girl. I normally wouldn't care, but during the time we were dating he was controlling, manipulative, a heavy drinker, a serial cheater, and emotionally, mentally and physically abusive to me (shoving, punching me in the face, yelling at me, calling my body disgusting, saying nobody loves me but him, etc). When I was dating him, the girl he dated before me reached out to me to warn me about him, but I didn't listen. All of the bad things he did to me, he had also done to her. She and I are now friends and I realized how thankful I was she tried to warn me.

Should I now reach out to this new girl and warn her? It's been over a year, I've moved on and have an amazing new boyfriend, and life is going great. I've blocked my ex on all socials so he won't know where I am and what I'm up to. I'm afraid if I warn this girl, that he'll find me and try to threaten my now-peaceful existence. Is it my duty as a woman to warn her? Or do I let her realize how awful he is on her own (shouldn'tbe hard due to his track record)? Thank you for your help."

I moved in with him after the end of a 7 year relationship and this is my first time living with another person I'm not dating or related to.

I've always had issues with his personal hygiene. But I tried to just work with it and eventually even figured out creative solutions.

Prior to the Coronavirus, I had convinced him to join me at the swimming pool in order to help him with his weight. It worked great because I killed two birds with one stone. Had him losing weight and taking regular showers at the pool.

But then everything shut down and we've been placed on home office and under quarantine.

The last time we went to the pool was March 1st. He has not bathed, used deodorant, or brushed his teeth since then. As a result, he and our shared flat smell like the underwear of a homeless man.

When he uses the bathroom. He doesn't wash his hands. He does however, go to the sink and wets his hands (doesn't actually wash, the water is on for literally two seconds)

It wasn't until today that I realized he hasn't had a hand towel in the bathroom, or a body towel for a long time. In fact the only towel in the bathroom is mine.

So anyways I vomited from the realization I've practically been drying off after my showers with his feces.

How do you suggest I bring this up to another grown man?

I get that not everyone has the same standard of clean, but I dunno I find this type of behavior downright insulting and it sucks because I even considered him like a friend."

0,"Why models are always young?. I’m not taking about runaway models. 

I’m talking about photography models(is it the name?).

I mean, older women in general have way more money and buying power than young women, so they’re usually the target customer. This applies to men as well.

Wouldn’t it make sense to hire models in this age range where their customers can relate to?

I think this is different to ugly models because nobody wants to acknowledge they’re ugly, so they wouldn’t want to relate to this hypothetical ugly model."

0,"Coronavirus or 5G?. Hahaha, somebody shoot me! 🥴

Man, just keep ya mind open, that’s all I’m saying. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Each to their own though. U know? The media say all this shit about wearing masks &amp; all, but yet... when they live broadcast &amp; talk their talk... Do u see them covered up &amp; preventing the spread of this so called ‘virus’?... Someone please tell me, how do they get to tell you what to do? But they don’t follow their own rules that they have set out????? 

istg, if this 5G shit wasn’t naked to the human eye, people would have a different view on this crazy outbreak of a ‘flu like’ symptom virus? 🤔 &amp; that’s when u go to the doctors, cos you wanna be safe &amp; protect your family &amp; make sure they’re ok. There’s nothing wrong with that, I get that, don’t get me wrong there! 

But okay, wait..

Let’s go back to last year: flu season! Hands up who went to go get a influenza shot &amp; still got sick? Stayed sick? Guess what? U probably got shot with someone else’s snot 🥴🤮 &amp; when you go doctors again to get tested because you have ‘flu like’ symptoms, you’re diagnosed with.... (🥁drumroll please) ‘CORONAVIRUS’  man, what perfect timing they have chosen? Season change when most people get sick 😳😷 &amp; then they inject you with the ‘antidote’ BOOM! That’s the magnetic cells (microchips) they inject you with, to affect &amp; control you! There’s a bigger field in Technology &amp; its already starting to take over! You’s have known this all along. As long as there’s 5G frequencies in the air &amp; you have been ‘cured’ you’re... (pardon my language) FUCKED! 🤭

Have you ever questioned why the lockdown is only at a restricted length of 4 weeks? Or is it 4 months? 👀🤷🏽‍♀️ I know when I get sick, it only takes about a couple days to a week to get better. Open your fullahs eyes bro! They’re installing more &amp; more 5G  towers &amp; little pinger towers, all around the motu! Honestly guys, just be aware of your surroundings. You’ll notice more towers once this lockdown shit is over with! &amp; you’re given the aye okay to come out &amp; play. 

Tell me? Is installing 5G towers classed as a essential work? Us being in lockdown is a blindfold, so you can’t see the bigger fkn picture of what’s really gonna poison us! Watch the skies at night, &amp; keep your ears open! 

Shit, even these cops are on the look out to make sure nobody out on the road watching, catching &amp; witnessing these robots planting the 5G towers in &amp; around your local area! 

- Airports
- Big corporate companies 
- Shopping malls
- Schools
- &amp; the city 

This big ass obsession we have with wanting faster internet &amp; shit, is lowkey gonna kill us!!!

Electric magnetic radiation energy frequency vibrations!!! I’m no scientist but it fucks with our oxygen atoms! Too much of it, will fry your ass up... &amp; would do more damage, than a crack pipe would. 💯👀🥴🤪🤣🤣🤗

I now understand why my uncle would turn the wifi off because of the effects radiation has on the human body. 

If you’re worried about the coronavirus, that’s cool. But worry about 5G too.

0,"[Serious] Is my house being cased?. I recently purchased a house (around two months ago) in a neighborhood that is somewhat known for having a high incidence of crime, and I’m a first time homebuyer.  I’ve previously lived in apartments and other places with other means of recycling and trash collection—you’ll see why this is relevant.  

Around 11 AM yesterday, my husband and I left and were away until around 8 PM.  When we got home, our recycling bin had been moved from its normal position along the side of the house out to the curb.  Funny thing is, though, that recycling collection is every other week, and this week is an off week.  No other recycling bins—nor trash bins for that matter—were placed out for pickup.  

My suspicion is the following:  a bad actor went to potentially try to look in windows (all of which have coverings), check if any windows or doors were open, and to see if/when we put the recycling bin back in its place.  

Some background info—husband is currently unemployed and we’re remodeling the bathroom.  As such, he doesn’t leave the house very often.  I work remotely, and due to current events, I’m also at home most of the time.

And this is to give you an idea of the layout of the property:  standing on the street looking toward the house, to the left is an alley and to the right is another house with a separation of around 10 feet.  Behind the house is a backyard, and a detached garage.  The backyard is fenced between the garage and the house, but the fence is lacking a gate.  The garbage and recycling bins are usually placed between my and my neighbor’s houses.  The house is set back approximately 30 feet from the street.  

What I’m wondering is if anyone has heard of burglars using this strategy to case houses, or if you potentially have an alternative explanation.  Also, any tips for residential security are more than welcome."

Hi all I am a 25 year old woman I am single (which is how I like it right now), I have two degrees, and live at home. I am seeing people my age have children, get married, and some have even had kids at 20.. it sort of gave me anxiety because I see all these people I graduated with from high school all have kids and I don’t know why people are having kids so young. I feel like an adult teenager meaning I feel so inexperienced in terms of life in general. Not saying I am not mature. I am saying that I feel like there is so much of life to discover that I haven’t yet. And I was just curious if I am still considered very young? To enjoy feeling sort of like a kid, that may sound weird? But it does scare me to turn 30. I’m not really at the level of what I want to be yet as I am still figuring myself out.

0,"Why are skateboarders more unwelcome in the suburbs?. My dad always shrugs his head and gives me that concerned look whenever I mention skating in the city (NYC), but what he dosent understand is that (at least in my experience) people are way more hostile to skaters in the suburbs!  Like taunts and comments are one thing, but then it graduated to almost getting hit by cars on purpose (mostly at night because prob drunk driving, but you still have some ballsy ones in daylight) to having random people looking for a fight (teenagers to grown men). I’m not lying lol it’s dangerous shit!  Also the kind of board I have is a cruiser, so in other words a short longboard.  I don’t do any tricks or attempt to get in anybody’s way, I just cruise around for fun.....I guess that’s the purpose of a cruiser anyway.  Now when I skate in the city, I barely notice any hostility from anyone,  yeah maybe the occasional taunt from like a kid once in a while lmao but it’s a far cry away from getting hit by a drunk driver!  In fact, I get a lot of compliments from strangers about my board, dog owners are nice too (and that’s because their pets get really excited whenever they hear a skateboard run by).  Probably because the city is generally more accepting towards different kinds of people including skaters.  I get why my dad’s worried, and it’s because nyc streets have a higher volume of traffic but sooner or later he has to understand that is a risk which comes with this kind of thing.

0,"Is my ex best friend a sociopath? How could someone do all this without feeling remorse?.    This is going to be super long because there is a lot of backstory and i tend to over-explain. But my god this girl ruined my freshman year of college and is the reason I dont trust people easily. It all started in high school. I had been friends with this girl since freshman year but we didn’t get super close until the end of our junior year. We would hang out almost everyday. She seemed so sweet to me at first, dropping everything to be by my side if I was having problems, checking up on me, she would bring me food/ Starbucks every so often, really nice things. I started to notice small things throughout our friendship that seemed off about her however, I kinda just brushed them off. So later down the road, we ended up getting into the same college and decided to room together (huuugee mistake). This is when I really started to notice she was not who I thought she was. 
     The start of college was great, we went out together, we rushed the same sorority, had the same friends, etc, but a few months into the semester she started to act different. There were a lot of times when I would ask her to go out to a party with me and she would say yes at first and then bail on me last minute (not a huge deal but kinda disappointing) so I would go out with other friends, but she started to get mad at me for coming home late, and by late I mean like any time past 11. She would like to go to bed super early (9-10pm) and despite me trying to be as quiet as possible when coming in (slowly opening the door, closing it as quietly as possible, grabbing my pajamas and stuff to get ready for bed in the bathroom down the hall so I wouldn’t make too much noise) she would still say I was too loud and I would wake her up every time I came in “late” at night. I would always apologize and tell her i was trying to be as quiet as I possibly could but in the back of my mind i knew she was kind of over reacting, people inevitably go out in college and I get that it is important to be respectful of your roommate but that goes two ways. She started to give off the vibe that she expected me to go to bed the same time she went to bed. She would shut off the lights at 9-10ish every night to go to bed and if I was just in bed on my laptop  doing homework or on my phone she would ask me to turn it off and go to sleep because the brightness from my devices was “distracting” and she couldn’t sleep. (Keep in mind I was on the bottom bunk and she was on the top bunk, how she could even see the light I don’t know) I would get so annoyed by this but just kinda let it slide because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt so I would throw my blanket over me so the brightness wouldn’t bother her. But seriously how could you just expect someone to abide by your 9pm bedtime? Seems a little ridiculous. I can remember a few instances where I would be at my friends dorm (which was across the street from mine) just hanging out or doing homework and if I was still there past 10-10:30 I would get a text from her asking me where I was and when I was going to be home. I would tell her “at ____’s  dorm, probably be home by 11-11:30” my roommate would then text me “can you come home like right now I am trying to go to bed and you always wake me up when you come in” and when I responded with something like “I am finishing a homework assignment up but I’ll come back once I’m done” to which she would proceed to text to the friend I was with to ask if she could “send me home because it was getting late and she wanted to sleep”. Who does that? She’s not my mother and cannot dictate what time I came home. There was another time where I went to my now boyfriends house (we had only been talking for less than a month at this point in time and weren’t dating yet though) to pick up alcohol for me and my friends who were visiting the next day (he was 21 so he would buy it for me). I was leaving my dorm room around 9pm to go walk to his house to pick up the bottle when my roommate asked me where i was going and what time I was going to be back, I told her what I was doing and that I would be back in about 30 mins ish, it was a 10-15 min walk. She said okay and I went on my way. When I was about halfway there I got a text from my boyfriend saying, “hey were you planning on staying the night?” I said I wasn’t planning on it but I could if he wanted me to, to which he said he was just wondering because my roommate texted one of his roommates that she knew to ask if he could ask my boyfriend to have me spend the night there so she could go to bed.    She had done this completely behind my back. When I had gotten to the house, I got a text from her saying “can you please spend the night there for my own sanity” i didn’t even know how to respond to this because first off, that is not my decision, second of all I felt unwelcome in my own room. This put me in a super uncomfortable situation especially because I had just started talking to this guy and he also had to wake up for work early the next morning. He was very nice about it and ended up telling me to just spend the night because he didn’t want me to have to deal with her but I still felt really bad and that I was being a nuisance. I again, was extremely annoyed by this but I brushed it off because I am a nice person and try to avoid conflict as much as possible. 
    The next day, a few of our high school friends came to visit us for the weekend and were staying in our dorm. Since the dorm was small, there weren’t many places for people to sleep so we had to squish people in. It was pretty late at night when everyone had arrived and when I was talking about where people were going to sleep, she had sprung it on me that she told a few of the people that were coming (these were close friends of hers, I wasnt very good friends with them) that they could sleep in my bed. I asked her why she would tell them that since I obviously planned on sleeping in MY bed and she told me that I she thought I could go to my boyfriends to sleep so everyone would fit. Then got mad at me when I said I wasn’t going to ask to sleep there since that is not my place to ask. Like what? 
   At the beginning of first semester, my roommate and i had agreed that we would switch bunks halfway through the school year since we both wanted bottom bunk to make it fair. So not even halfway through the first semester my roommate told me that she was super uncomfortable on the top bunk because it was too hot and she had issues sleeping up there and asked if I would switch with her. Normally this wouldn’t be a huge problem for me but since this happened after all the other stuff I had described earlier I was pretty fed up and reminded her that we agreed to switch halfway through the year. After she begged me, I gave in and agreed to switch bunks with her. I would like to add that I was a very good roommate to her, i would do anything to keep her happy since I am a people pleaser. I would keep the room clean, I would bring her home Starbucks if she was having a bad day, I cleaned her side of the room and made her bed a few times to surprise her, stuff like that, but nothing was ever good enough. 
     A few weeks after reluctantly switching bunks with her, I started to notice she was acting stranger than usual, for instance, she would be on the phone with her mom when I would come in after class or something and would get awkward and quickly end the phone conversation. I later found out that she was actually talking to her parents about moving into a single dorm and hid it from me until literally two days before she planned on moving out. I was so upset and felt like everything was my fault even though I tried my hardest to make our rooming situation work. I was also worried about the fact that I would probably have to have a new roommate move in, which would have most likely be this girl down the hall who was about to get kicked out of her previous room because of what a nightmare she was. I expressed to my roommate that I didn’t want this to happen and that I wished she had told me earlier so I could figure the situation out. She had told me however that she was talking to this other girl she was friends with that lived in our building and said that girl needed to move into another room since her current roommate was planning on moving into her sorority house second semester. I knew the girl she was talking to, she was super cool and nice so I would have been perfectly fine with rooming with her. 
    I was under the impression that this girl was going to move into my room since my roommate assured me that she had everything set up. Come to find out, the girl my roommate was talking about had already told her that she made plans to live with another one of her friends, information i later found out my roommate knew all along but decided to not to tell me and instead lie about it to make the situation seem better. So since those plans fell through, and since my roommate moved out at a weird point in the year, I was given one of two options. Either have the psycho girl who was in the process of getting kicked out of her room move into mine or buy out the other half of the room. After talking to my dad about the whole situation he said living with psycho girl was out of the question since he didn’t want me to be miserable and that he saw no other choice but to just buy out the second half of the room. Of course my parents were not happy about this by any means but they wanted to make sure I was comfortable in my own room, which I am super grateful for.. 
    A girl who I thought was my best friend seemed to not care at all how this affected me. At first having a room to myself was nice, but that feeling quickly faded and just turned into me feeling incredibly lonely. I never had issues with anxiety up until this point, i started to question whether any of the friends I had made at that point even liked me and began to distance myself from others. Eventually it got to the point where the thought of leaving my room made me anxious. Regardless of all she had put me through to this point and how much she hurt me I still remained friends with her because she was in the same sorority that i was in and was friends with the same people I was friends with. Staying friends with her, I thought, was just easier since I didn’t want to cause any drama. 

     So toward the end of Second semester, after she had been moved out for awhile my now ex roommate texted me telling me that her siblings (her sister (21) and her brother (24)) were coming to visit and asked if they could sleep in my room so they didn’t have to get a hotel and since she didn’t have enough room in her single dorm. I was confused why she even asked me this for aforesaid reasons and also because her brother worked on Wall Street and was making 6 figures, so why getting a hotel wasn’t an option I don’t know. I said no, first of all I was not comfortable with her 24 year old brother whom I had only met twice sleeping in my room and second of all it was on a Thursday night and I had an exam the next morning at 9am. I told her something like “oh I’m sorry but I have to say no since I have an exam the next day and I don’t wanna have to stay up late to let them into the building once you guys get back from going out” to which she had the AUDACITY to respond with “please, they would only be going there to sleep”. Excuse me? You expect me to house your siblings in MY dorm which you chose to move out of and stay up late to let them in when I have an exam  the next day? When you would get mad at me for disrupting your sleep when I would come home late? I was so fed up at this point. I told her no I’m sorry again and she replied “k I’m sorry I even asked” I really started to believe there was something wrong with her at this point that she got mad at me for saying no. I started to distance myself from her at this point but again, still remained friends with her.  

Flash forward to sophomore year, we were both moving into our sorority house. I was in a different room than her (thank god). To make things less confusing from this point on im going to give names to the people involved. So my ex roommate and ex best friend let’s call her Brittnay and I were both really close to this girl in my house, let’s call her Abby. We all hung out all the time and even though I still had issues with Brittnay I shoved them aside since I thought if I said anything it might affect my friendship with Abby. I also became super close to the girls I was rooming with, one of them, let’s call her Jessica, was not friends with Brittnay so I eventually told her everything that went down with Brittnay because I had never really talked about it with anyone and needed to get it off my chest. She was shocked but gave me some great advice and made me feel so much better(she is still one of my best friends to this day) I asked her not to say anything because I didn’t want to be known as the girl that talked shit in the house, and she kept it a secret. 
   So fast forward to second semester, in my sorority house we changed rooms at this point, and I was rooming with another one of my good friends while Brittnay and Abby planned on rooming together. Turns out, I heard a rumor that Brittnay had also told another girl, Megan that she would room with her. I didn’t know if this was true or not but considering all the shit that Brittnay put me though the year before, i wouldn’t have been surprised. I planned on telling Abby but wanted to get all the facts  and make sure it was true before I did. So it came time to preference roommates and somehow, Brittnay, Abby and Megan all ended up in a triple room even though Abby and Megan both were able to get a double room (we went based on a point system so they had enough points for a double room). So a little background, in a triple, one person doesn’t get a bed and has to sleep in the open air which is not the most desirable situation. So Megan ended up getting thrown under the bus having to sleep in the open airs. This is when everything came together. So Brittnay had been double teaming Megan and Abby, giving them the impression that she was rooming with them in a double then when they both preffed her, and she only preffed one of them as a roommate they would end up in a triple and since she had a little bit more points then Megan, she would end up getting a bed in the room, throwing Megan in the open airs. She also at one point apparently texted the girl in charge of keeping track of points and asked her how many points she would need to get ahead of Megan and Abby, so she had this plan in the works and didn’t even care that she would be throwing two of her best friends in the house under the bus. For me, this was the last straw and the point I decided I would never be friends with Brittnay again. You can do what you want to me but if it involves my friends I show no mercy. I told Megan and Abby everything Brittnay had done to me in the past and how I was super upset that she could do this again to people she was close with. 
    So before this Megan and Abby were not that close so they never figured out what was going on but they got together and decided to confront her for being shady. They each texted Brittnay separately (she didn’t know they were together) and asked her what was going on. Brittnay responded to them saying she had no idea why they were in a triple. Megan had expressed that she was upset and knew that was bullshit and that she was scheming. Abby had also texted brittnay saying that her and Megan were upset to which Brittnay had responded to Abby saying that Megan was just upset because she didn’t like Abby very much. Megan never said this and it was just a plot to turn Megan and Abby against each other to make her seem less like the bad guy in this situation. 
    So Brittnay ended up dropping our sorority and moving into an apartment since everyone in the house hated her at this point and so she could avoid confrontation. She still will deny that she did anything wrong and refuses to apologize about anything. 
   Also, side note I also later found out after all this stuff went down, that in high school, while we were “best friends” Brittnay hooked up with this guy I had dated right after we ended things. I had confided in her, cried to her over him and she did this knowing how heartbroken I was. I also found out she spread rumors about me and told people things that I told her in secrecy. Personal things. 
    So Luckily I have some of the best friends in the world now who would do anything for me, and I am a much stronger person now, but this girl put me through hell. I have always wondered what was wrong with her? Is she a narcissist? A sociopath? I don’t know but I know she has no empathy for others and doesn’t care who she has to put down to get herself on top. She also believes everyone still likes her despite all that happened. I just don’t understand this one and how she could be so manipulative."

Not much more to say aside from the title...Late last night (like an hour ago) I received a text from a cousin who I maybe talk to a few times a year.  It was a video message of her in what I assume is a shower (camera moves around quite a bit but stays above her navel) with her breasts exposed.  

The video is maybe 15 or so seconds long and includes her face momentarily.  A second text of just a period ""."" directly followed the first text but no other message has been sent.

I'm at a loss on how to respond, or even if I should respond.  I don't know if it was an accident (I assume it was) and if so if I should make a joke or just...I really have no idea.  I've known her since she was a baby pretty much (shes a few years younger than me) so this is just about the weirdest thing all around for me.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Do I just ignore it?  Wait to see if she acknowledges it first?  Do I warn her in case it is someone doing something malicious?  Plz help.

0,"[Serious] What is wrong with stock buybacks?. There has been some negative press lately about how airlines have used their free cash flow, driven by recent tax cuts, to buy back stock.

A major purpose of joint-stock companies (an old-timey way of saying ""corporations"") is to maximize shareholder value.  Corporations normally do this in the form of dividends, but buybacks also pay back investors in the form of higher per-share prices.

There is actually a rule, that can be enforced by suit from shareholders, that a corporation is holding back too much of its retained earnings.  There is also a tax rule, rarely enforced, that too much liquid cash can be taxed at a higher punitive rate than the usual corporate tax rate.

I understand that the TCJA's cut on corporate taxation was marketed as a way to increase workers' pay (which was mostly a lie), but:  Isn't every director on every BoD legally if not morally obligated to find a way to pass the reduced taxation, and therefore increased after-tax profit, on to their investors?  Dividends are the usual mode of returning value to investors, but stock buybacks accomplish a similar result.

I feel like the current vilification of airlines is basically blaming them for not having huge surpluses of cash, that in a different timeline would subject them to excess accumulation tax penalties.

Unless I am wrong, buybacks and dividends serve exactly the same purpose and should be treated equally."

0,"Help: Need to disinfect (non-pandemic related). So this couldn't have happened at a worse time.

Sewer backed up in my basement over the weekend. Had 2 feet of standing sewage (read: human feces from other units in apartment building) and now I need to clean it up cause landlord sucks.

Thankfully I have a respirator from painting so I don't have to breathe in all the hazmat particles. Normally I would just get a bunch of Lysol wipes and disinfect storage containers and other bulk items I'm not throwing away/claiming on renters insurance.

However, due to the time we live in, I can't find anything like that from the stores, so this is where you come in Reddit!

I will be cleaning off metal, wood, plastic, and concrete (by hand and mopping), what can I use for disinfectant? I don't want to use just soap and water due to the level of bacteria that is present.

My cat also loves the basement and we keep the litter box down therezl, so that's another reason to do a really good job disinfecting. Cat has moved in to our kitchen until I fix it, so don't worry about whiskers.

tldr; Need to clean/disinfect a basement that was flooded with septic (fecal) water. What can I use/create besides soap+water and is available despite the hoarding of Lysol/disinfectant wipes?"

I guess me only question is how does everyone feel about this.

0,"Closed Eye Visuals as a kid. So hopefully this makes sense, but i tripped for the first time a few weeks ago and when I closed my eyes, I experienced closed eye visuals, a common effect of psychedelics. After the trip ended, I suddenly remembered how often I used to get these visuals as a kid. Like I obviously wasn’t tripping balls as a kid, but I would have CRAZY visuals whenever I would close my eyes. I’d do it before falling asleep, when I was bored, in the car, if my parents were fighting.... I’d close my eyes and think to myself “I’m gonna close my eyes and go to the movies.”  Like the visuals were that clear where it was almost like watching a cartoon show. I’d say this went on until I was in about 4th or 5th grade, I can’t really remember when I stopped doing that, but i haven’t been able to get those visuals since I was really little. I totally forgot all about that until I tripped the other day. Does anyone know why I was able to do this as a kid? Why it stopped? I’m so curious about it!!!!"

But after what he had done, i couldn’t bear to hear his name or even see his face, it would make my stomach hurt. I sent him a very straight forward text about why i never wanted to speak to him again, and he never seemed to understand and tried to flip it on me, and we didn’t speak for about a year. 


Until a couple weeks ago, he all of the sudden kept replying to my Snapchat stories as if nothing had happened?? The first time i was tempted to respond, but didn’t. Then he messaged again, and again, and i finally responded with something lighthearted and i was nice?? like wtf?? i keep responding to this asshole as if nothing happened! Then, he sent a long “apology” if you could even call it that. He essentially said “it wasn’t my intention to take advantage of you i guess it just happened sorry”. Bruh. Thankfully i never said “it’s ok” or “i forgive you” i told him the cold hard truth, that i cried every night for a long time and couldn’t sleep because of him. He told me that he wanted to be “friends” again and that he’d wait for when i was ready. I WILL NEVER BE READY! i didn’t respond to that text, and he took that as me BEING READY 



He now continues to message me and you know what i do? Reply. 

I don’t understand why i’m doing this, because it’s almost calming talking to him, but then i also feel like vomiting. Whats also disgusting is that he is trying to flirt with me, how the hell is that ok?

He got onto me last friday about asking to leave 30 minutes early, literally chewing and cussing me out. He mentioned the write-up and how it says I'm on probation. I told him I haven't seen or signed that write-up. He said it doesn't matter, that's what it says. I was off monday, to spend time with my friend from out of state. I went to work tuesday morning feeling pretty rough. I had a sore throat and a nasty headache. Once things started rolling at work, I started coughing. A lot. My supervisor told me they had sent someone home the day before because he was coughing. A short time later, my operations manager sent me home, saying I couldn't come back without a clean bill of health. He told me not to clock out or touch anything and just go. I left and went straight to the doctor's office. They said I had strepp throat and she was keeping me out of work until monday. I got a doctors note and delivered it to the office manager. She said that was fine, see ya monday. I picked up my meds and went home. Then the plant manager (boss that ""wrote me up""), called me and immediately began chewing me out for having to miss work. Said it was unprofessional and that if I was sick I should have gone to the doctor on my day off. I told him i didnt feel sick on my day off and I'm pretty sure it was work that was making me cough so much. It was an industrial job. Lots of steel dust, acid/zinc fumes, and tons of other crap floating around the air. I tried to defend myself, but he wouldn't let me. He then told me this was just another attendance issue and that he was tired of it, so he was letting me go. I tried to tell him he cant do that, he told me it wasnt up for discussion. I told him fine, but I want corporate's contact info, and he just hung up on me. Now nobody will answer me. Can he really fire me for that? I had a doctor's note and everything. What with the pandemic, I highly doubt I will be able to get a job anytime soon. I have a family to provide for and I pay all the bills. My mom and my wife said I should get a lawyer and sue for wrongful termination. I dont know what to do. If anyone can help, I am all ears. I've also got this posted in r/legaladvice.


TL;DR My boss fired me for being sick, citing a write-up I've never seen/signed."

So, it is not 100% but maybe 80% that I fall in love with the girl. I usually like her personality, even though it can be very different in every show, and shit here we go again.

I hate it because that sometimes makes me miss other important parts of the show. What is wrong with me I can't even watch it in peace? Xd
Anyone who can put some light in that shit?

• Somehow it’s un-American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.
• Russians influencing our elections are bad, but illegal Mexicans voting in our elections are good.
• It was cool for Joe Biden to ""blackmail"" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquires about it.
• Twenty is too young to drink a beer, but eighteen is old enough to vote.
• Sexualizing children is bad, but 11-year-old drag queens are good.
• Illegals aren't required to show ID, but citizens can't buy cough medicine without it.
• Citizens are fined if they don’t buy their own health insurance, and then they are forced to buy it for illegals.
• People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.
• Inflammatory rhetoric is outrageous, but harassing people in restaurants is virtuous.
• People who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for useless degrees.
• Immigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome, but you’d better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.
• Irish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate must go through a rigorous vetting process, but any illiterate Central-American gang-banger who jumps the southern fence is welcome.
• $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free” health care for illegals is not.
• If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.
• Politicians who say that the President is not above the law put illegal immigrants and themselves above the law.
• People who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.
• Illegals don’t pay taxes, but they get tax refunds.
• We see other countries going Socialist and collapsing, and it seems like a great plan to us.
• Voter suppression is bad, but not allowing the President to be on the ballot is good.
• Fourth-of-July parades are bad, but parades of women dressed as vaginas are good.
• Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.
• Criminals are catch-and-released to hurt more people, but stopping them is bad because it's a violation of THEIR rights.

COMPLETELY new to anything pc gaming related ....So I have (idr the exact names and theyre at my fathers house rn) I believe a gtx 2sum bnib and if I’m not mistaken or at least from I was told a “Sum 1080ti” which is the one jus under the “gtx 2sum” which is supposes to be one of the best graphics cards currently available no? (The gtx 2sum that is lol)
  
  Now, lets roll with these fx cards are what I’ve been told they are ....if I was to buy the Dell g5 5590, or the 5587

 **which one should I buy/why or why not that one?** 

**what trim lvl would be best to run max “Hz” for 280fps** 

**If not that Dell set up what else within reasonable entry price? OPEN TO ALL SUGGESTIONS**

**Define “Hz” lol**

**Plz breakdown how this all works in layman’s terms, if anyone can simplify the process and lmk how, what, does who, where? that would honestly help the most** 

**Can I put the gtx into either the 9-0 or 8-7? like is it more or less plug n play? Also would either laptop be able to run its ‘full potential’ I guess so to speak? Tying back into trim lvls on the hardware itself I guess?** 

**Does the screen on the laptop have to be able to support a high “Hz refresh rate” for me to port the laptop itself to a monitor that can/does?” Or can I jus play it off the monitor no worries??** 

Im one for knowledge so if anyone wants to geek out with me u guys got my attention ....Being the kind person I am although I acquired this set up for only $500 cash (I’m a capitalist) it was a whole pc, it had the dope colored water cool thingy, was completely hand built dude jus took the motherboard or w.e held his personal info (I have ....No idea) I gave the pc itself to my Pops, wife’s kid, he wants to be a graphic designer or w.e, this was a couple few months ago and he moved out within the last 90 days I went to baby sit and low and behold there the fx cards are the one still in box ....and the kid I got it from used to play a heli sim so I have the gear from that (no idea what to do it?? with supposedly identical to actual heli controls I personally doubt it lol) 

**My base idea** 

Want to jus get a laptop that can attach/run the better graphics card and/or frames with no issues (only goin to be playing MW on it for now) I want that crispness I’ve only ever seen in random clips online lol 
And as long as the laptop (gpu/cpu?) is runnin smooth jus get myself a nice lil 32” monitor n be a crispy kid. I jus wanna be a Krispy Kid!!!

Soo I was like ok y not its a nice thing to do (ik im dumb but anyway) i leave after getting brainwashed and told all these nice things and my friend takes the car. I later find out she gave it to her boyfriend and its not even for her wtf right. I never meet the dude so im like sketched out after learning he has been driving drunk and high in my car without a license so i think hell no i need to take this car away from them but they refuse to give me the car because they paid for the down payment and demand it back. But I don’t work and have no money so i get a job to be able to get my car back. Once I started working i did everything I could to get them to give me the car back because at this point i also find out they both lost their jobs. So im left with their debt. I then gained the courage to go to the boyfriends house to take my car back and when i get home I notice the car is extremely keyed. But there are so many legal issues involved.

If everyone in an advantageous position like me is willing to donate their salary, I believe we can help a large number of families sail through these tough times with a little extra comfort and peace of mind. 

Does anyone have thoughts or suggestions on how to go about it? Do let me know if this not a good idea."

0,"Should i cut off this person?. My cousin(14), i'll call her M, has a brother(18), who i'll call G, and a sister(17) who i'll call P. We've been basically best friends since i was born, even though she lives across the country. I would always see her in christmases and summers, and we would facetime almost every week, text regularly, etc. She was the best. But since recently, it seems every time i talk to her and every visit i make, i only end up feeling worse. Whether it be her invalidating my anxiety, her taking my stuff, her manipulating me, her making me feel terrible about myself, etc. I love M. I love her. But i feel its going too far. I have 2 dads and they all love them. But recently, me and P were having a conversation and she asks if im straight. (Im not.) Now, keep in mind this dads side of the family is VERY redneck yee haw. So i'm a little scared and i say ""Yep."" P lets out a breath and goes ""Phew. Good."" (MY DADS R GAY)And she goes on about how her professor was asking everyone's pronouns (which i thought was the sweetest) and how she thought that was stupid and she was making fun of it. She asks me ""Are your pronouns girl or boy"" I was trying not to cry, saying ""she/her. i'm a girl"" P says ""Hah, good."" I had enough and went to bed. G is my favorite. He's so sweet even though he's not the brightest. Always supporting me and helping me in school. I'm not out to him though. It sucks and tbh I don't want to cut my cousins off, but they're so toxic to me. Help?"

0,"[serious] How would you describe the lifestyles of the rich in your community?.  In my community, most of the “rich” people have depressing lives. For example, their McMansions are filthy, there’s deep resentment in the family, the adults are addicts/alcoholics in denial, their pets are anxious and not tended to, and there’s a tense paranoia. They are exhausted by the “act” of convincing everyone that they are cultured and deserving.  The primary emotion I pick up on is shame. I guess they’re simultaneously ashamed of their ostensible wealth and ashamed of anyone who isn’t quite so ostentatious.

I’m thinking about all of this not as a way to target the rich but as a real world exercise in understanding why things are the way they are."

Yesterday we had a health scare thinking that he might have caught the covid-19, turns he got dengue fever. He got paranoid when we asked about the tests he did and when we tried to reconfirm the information he told us. After that I talked to him and explained that we were being concerned.

My father has always been a strong man, running a pretty big business and supporting the whole extended family. And now that he’s feeling doubtful and faithless in himself, I have no idea how to deal with this or how to help him. I’m a realist, and have a stoic outlook in life.

0,"when should i worry about the nightmares im having?. BACKGROUND :
i have been afraid of the dark for pretty much my whole life...but when i was in high school i started choosing darkness when i would sleep and would just keep a small nightlight on throughout the night. when i met my boyfriend i shared this fear with him when he asked what my biggest fear was. 
i said to go blind because i was that scared of the dark. 
we have been together for a long time now and because we live an hour away from each other i normally spend the week at home and weekends at his place. everything was good..we had that going for a while and still do it.  my fear with the dark never got in the way while sleeping over bc we tend to fall asleep cuddling. i recently came to visit for springbreak which began on the 9th of march (for breaks from school i spend all of it with him so i came to stay for the week) but that sunday i remember tossing and turning at 2 maybe 3 am not being able to sleep. i felt uneasy so i got up to turn on the closet light on  and opened the door. i got on my phone for about an hour and i remember i randomly pit it down and stares at the door and broke down crying in fear. the fact that i didnt know why i was reacting like this scared me even more. my boyfriend woke up and turned the lights on and switched sides with me so i wouldnt be facing the door..the next morning he told me i had fell asleep in seconds after the lights were on.
from then on i slept on the side away from the door and again..i returned to normal.

NOW:
our springbreak got extended 2 more weeks so im still at my bf’s house.. i have been having terrible dreams alll week long. i havent gotten good sleep and i stay up all night just tp get my sleep during the day with lights on WITH THE HOPE OF MAKING IT BETTER. the nightmares are very gory and i remember every detail when i wake up and through out the day. i even wait till the end of the day to tell my bf about them. some involve me killing to protect myself and its like horror movies on repeat. i havent had the same nightmare twice if that helps .idk what to do or if i should seek help about it. i havent gone through any traumatic event recently, it came from nowhere. when do i start to worry about my nightmares??"

My sister is a recovering alcoholic - which is great - but she is also very annoying and doesn’t stop posting daily life quotes and judges anyone who does drink and can control themselves. She’s becoming a little bit of a narcissist.

So I started a new job in January of which I have never done before so everything is new to me. Apparently there is a great deal to learn and it can take 6-12 months to learn the job and even afterwards you're still learning. So I have been put on a shift with two guys approximately 5/6 years older than me (I'm 26 M). When I first started they were kind of helpful and understanding of my lack of knowledge. But after four or so weeks I could visibly see the anger on their faces if I make a mistake and they have started to ridicule me and be very condescending. For example the main guy who is training me looks over everything single thing I'm doing over my shoulder and points out mistakes before I have the chance to figure them our for myself in order to retain said knowledge. There are many more examples of this and other type of behaviour towards me which makes me very uncomfortable and therefore not in the best headspace to learn properly. Especially when I'm made to feel like an idiot for asking a question and not have it explained fully. 

It's making me really anxious and unhappy and I'm unsure of what to do as I am a temporary worker at the moment and I feel like they hold all the power over me and know it so take pleasure in making me feel stupid. 

Side note: I also kind of think that because I have been to university and those two haven't, they feel great that they know more than me and love bringing me down saying stuff like 'how have you been to university, you can't even do X or X'

I already have got a jar of Nutella and want to suck that off his dick next time he picks me up from work ;)"
0,"What are some of the positive short term and long term impacts we will experience from the coronavirus?. I know a lot of people are worried about getting sick, hospitals potentially reaching capacity, the economy crippling, etc. Those are obviously some negative impacts. But I’ve seen some positive changes with posts talking about the waters in Italy becoming clearer since boats are no longer polluting or stirring sand/dirt around.

0,"Panic buyers of Reddit, is there something about the coronavirus you know about that I don’t?. I’m genuinely asking here. I’m not trying to come across rude.

Basic hygiene isn’t brand new, we all are meant to wash our hands after the toilet etc. We are all meant to have common courtesy and cover our nose and mouth when we cough and sneeze.

What’s with all the toilet roll? I know we need to use it, but a kart full of them?

Bottled water? Has water gone off in places? Would you not boil your tap water and let it cool if you were concerned?

Loads and loads of hand soap?

Sorry so many questions, but I’m genuinely curious what has tipped people over the edge this time round when we’ve had worldwide viruses before."

0,"Membership stores (Costco, Sam's Club) can solve the hoarding crisis. Why don't they?. tl;dr: Costco, institute a block at the checkout which limits purchases of toilet paper, rice, and hand sanitizer to 1 purchase per membership every 2 weeks.

Have you seen the videos of the hoarders racing through Costco as soon as they open in order to buy 5 or 10 packs of toilet paper? (Enough for a year of bathroom activities for most people.).  Costco has now instituted a 2-item limit for key items like toilet paper and paper towels, but that doesn't go far enough, because the hoarders persist -- toilet paper disappears within the first 30 minutes of the store opening.  Why?  Because the people with toilet paper stocked to the roof of their garage just had to buy more this morning.  In fact, they were so desperate to buy more that (according to the manager at my local store) they had to call the police to control the crowd.

Wait, there's a solution...

Costco has a history of all of my purchases.  If they were to check my membership, they'd notice that I haven't purchased TP in over 6 weeks.  But, if I went in tomorrow, I wouldn't be able to buy any.  Why?

All Costco has to do is implement a software solution at the registers.  It really is very simple.  Track the purchase history of key items that are being hoarded. Rather than implementing a limit of how many items a person can buy at a time, limit the number of those items that can be purchased every 2 weeks.  When you get to the register, if you've already purchased 50 packs that week, sorry you can't buy more.  You might want to leave some for the non-hoarders.

So, my PSA question to all the membership stores is the following:  Why haven't you done this already?  Why are you allowing the insanity to persist?  NOT doing this is downright reckless, as you're endangering your patrons. (Clearly if you have to call the police because you're afraid for the safety of your own employees, you've already allowed the line to be crossed)"
0,"My boyfriend likes transporn and slept with a transwoman. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together now for a 3 years. We live together and our relationship is really healthy. He loves me very much and i also love him more than everything. I would take a bullet for him but long story short: 

He told me couple weeks ago that he likes to watch transporn and to be honest i got bit confused. I asked him if that is something that straight men watch bcuz i’ve never heard any of my guy friends mentioning transporn. So whatever i let it slide bcuz it’s just a fetish/fantasia. We all have our fantasies. Then couple days ago he told me that he had sex with a transwoman (little bit before we met). I got really really confused. He told me that he ”fucked” her and they both perfomed oral sex on each other. He also told me that it was a one time thing. That after it he was really disgusted and asked himself what was he thinking. He described me the feeling that it was liie when you watch some weird porn and then after masturbating and cuming you feel disgusted and really disappointed in yourself. So i asked him if that is something he likes and told it won’t happen again. 

Now i’m so lost and i don’t know what to do. This is all i think about every morning i wake up and when i’m going to sleep. What should i do? Am i too selfish if i leave him? I love him so much but this is eating me inside. All i do is cry all the time. I can’t focus on anything i’m lost. I’m schoked that i even found word to write this. Some of yall probably won’t understand my reaction. Help me please!! Can i get over this somehow? I don’t wanna be that wife who is all the time thinking if he is unhappy and cheating on me when he is late out.

0,"What was wrong with my legs?. So when I was about 10 my legaroonies stopped working. I could feel them but I just couldn’t stand or move.. it was as if I was paralyzed from the waist down ( my pp did still work though ). 

It all started one day when I awoke from a mesmerizing slumber, I stood up, ready for my day ahead of me to begin. I knew something was strange when I stood up and my ankles became oodles amounts of sore. I didn’t role them, I didn’t run or do anything too strenuous but for some odd reason they hurted. 

The previous days I was sick ass can be. I was regurgitating and emptying my bowels of everything that I could bequeath upon my gullet. So I already wasn’t going to school for the week but I did have to accommodate my mother on her daily routines. 

Any-who after a day of sore ankles I finished the night with a perfect regurgitation and another night of orgasmic dreaming. For the next day would be my reckoning....

As the next the sunshine arose so doth I. With my peers (brothers, and mother) sitting along side at the round table of my palace in which I lived... I arose. But unbeknownst to I, my legaroonies hath becomith thy noodleoonies. Instantly as I was heading the floor I realized I had lost something.... all my legaroonies capabilities. 

The rest of the day my families had thought I was a faker. But joke on them, I was not faking. 

My legaroonies were not working. 

I began to do as I had before. Follow my women (mother) around for her daily routing. For close to a fortnight my family had thought I was faking. Yet again I was no fake. I was an honest boy. 

After days and days of not being able to hold my solids and liquids down I began to fall very ill as did my body whenever I would try to thrust myself to a proper stance ( just standing up ). 

Eventually my blood, my life giver, my mommy, would bring me to the hospital. Me being young and incapable of walking she’d laid me down nice and sweet into a chair with wheels. 

As the doctor gazed upon my legaroonies he hath noticed that indeed they had become... noodleoonies...

He left the room in a quick blur for he had the medicine that would give me a quick cure....

For he had the pill that would save me for the rest of my days....

He told me If I don’t swallow the pill he’s putting it in my butt. I did as he told, for I’m not gay... the next day I could walk again and I wasn’t sick. 

La fin. 


Based on a true story about me in third grade when I couldn’t walk. My legaroonies became noodleoonies. 

As I search the internet there is no answers. The doctor I had seen, had never seen this before but he cured it with a quick pill and I’ve never seen him after and have never spoken of this since he almost put a pill in my butt."

I’m smart and can focus at home but since I graduated high school with a low GPA my options for a good education now are seemingly scarce, and in-classroom classes are extremely hard for me to sit and focus through. I twitch and get panicky and anxious whenever material gets challenging or I feel uncomfortable.

I then received a call from an older client who’s card I also had on amazon account and was told that I charged the tv to his older expired Amex card. He didn’t realize I charged it and assumed it was fraud. After finding out from amex I placed the charge he contacted me to see what the story was. I explained to him of the possible mix up on Amazon’s part and I called them Immediately. I advised them the receipt they provided me showed the correct customer, the correct billing address, &amp; the correct credit card. But they charged the wrong credit card, with the wrong person, the wrong billing address &amp; the wrong credit card. Which mind u was expired. So at this point I’m not sure how any of that went through. But non the less the amazon rep was very nice and informed me because the charge went through I didn’t have to worry. I explained to her that the charge went through the wrong customer and the charge needed to go through my correct customer. She then stated there is nothing she can do because the charge already cleared. She stated if I want, I could just return the tv for a refund  then just reorder the tv. I educated her that I had just finished mounting the Tv above a fireplace and I wasn’t about to remove the tv and remount it. I proceeded to figure out how to correct this with her for the next hour she had no solutions. Her final thought was just to pay my old customer the funds that were taken from his account. I advise thats not possible because my current customer wanted to get points on his amex for this transaction. After going back and forth with me telling her to correct the purchase I got no where. And she advised for me just to send the old customer the fees and resolve issue. Embarrassing I called my old customer and updated him on the error. He was completely fine with situation and didn’t have any problems with that. I also advised my current customer and educated him what happen and he understood also and wrote me a check for the TV, which I immediately transferred to my old customers account. Everything is fine. All the issues are resolved. 
3 days later my amazon account was locked. All my Amazon was locked!! All my TVs (fire sticks) all my amazon echos, dots, kindles, door locks, everything. I was completely shut down!

I already fixed this. I paid the dude. We’re good. So this auto generated email they sent me had a hyperlink to click to access my account and update or respond. But the problem is I can’t click the link because my account is locked! I have no way of logging in. So I replied to email explaining issue. And all I get is an auto generated message. So after countless tries I finally get a 800 number to call. But the 800 number says the can’t help me cause fraud department doesn’t have phone support only email support. So after 4 hours on the phone the customer service manger states she will update info and email them. I went through this everyday for the next 7 days. Getting now where.

Just auto generated emails. 2 weeks later after making daily calls, I finally get some tech that is willing to escalate me to his manger. This guys knows exactly what’s going on. I’m batting 1000.

He makes me feel awesome He goes on to tell me how transparent he is and this can take 3-5 more business days to get resolved. He states these thing can take some time. So after 26 calls, 8 emails, 2 letters to Jeff Bezos, 6 twitters I’m still exactly where u was 18 days ago.

I am a pretty physically large guy, 6’4”, 260 pounds (not “cut”, but not “fat”) and I’m very strong for a non-power lifter. I am the runt in my family. So I’ve never felt very big in my life, as I don’t really realize it. Recently, I’ve come into an issue with an ex where her boyfriend (my guess is 5’10, 165) tends to like...put his ego out there. I don’t intimidate people intentionally. When in a room of many people, I lean on something so I’m shorter. I sit if possible. I never really stand up unless I need to. 

In short, my question is just, basically, do other men feel threatened when their ex’s boyfriend/their friend/random passerby/other men are physically larger? Is this an instinctual thing? Is this outdated? I find it annoying. I’m fairly tranquil and it gets old, fast. 

Let me know what y’all think."

0,"Anyone felt this??. I don’t really know where to post this or what to do but here I go. yesterday I lost a good friend and a brother in an accident. Purest selfless person out there, gets hit and boom just like that. About a month and a half ago over the course of a few days I got a sense and feeling of death. I couldn’t figure out if it was me , sensing my death. It was kinda like I would get hit with a feeling of uncertainly/fear/tragic loss all in one. I can’t really explain it but I knew it, It felt as if someone I knew very much or me would die, something impactful. I tried putting it together and even told my best friend about it and I forgot about it. Sometimes I would feel it but as time went on I kinda just ignored it. Yesterday March 14, 2020 I got the news that my homie was hit avoiding an accident and I just lost it. I didn’t realize it then but I did later, I never thought these sensations would come true, I just felt like it was my mind playing tricks and now I’m wondering what the hell is happening. Here’s the thing, 2 days prior from the accident m on March  12,2020 I was at bdubs, picking up a to go order. The lady said nobody called in an order (even though my brother did) so I went ahead and placed one and went to my car waiting. Fast forward 10 minutes I go back to check if it’s ready and as I’m paying I see him (one who passed)   And he’s with another friend (both involved in the accident) and I waved at them. As I proceeded to pay and walk out , before I could even open the door I get that sensation of (go back and say hi). It hit me and I went ahead and did, said hi to them , asked em what they ate and the last things I said to them was “be safe”. The friend he was with is okay, few broken ribs, I am not as close to him but I fw him. fast forward to now I’m still taking it all in, I’ve had dreams come true but never something like this. What made me go back and talk to them??  I’m grateful I did , I’m grateful for being able to say a few last things to him before he passed. I’m grateful for that order not going through the first time, I lost someone who I never made enough memories with. Everybody loves him, such a selfless soul. I’m trying coming to terms with whatever I felt and his passing but it’s just a train wreck. And to top it off , that morning of his passing , I saw his mom at the gym around 9am before it all happened. I wanna think this is all a big coincidence but signs were all there, what’s the odds I’d run into them both back to back. Crazy to think that at that time, everyone was their normal selves before it happened and now some people’s lives will never be the same. Couldn’t imagine a mother’s loss, my heart and prayers goes out to them."

0,"I work in an office with close to 1,000 people, and they are doing nothing about the Coronavirus.. I should start off by saying I’m not going to mention the company or what state I’m located in, (US). But it is spreading rapidly where I am. Schools, retailers and other businesses have been shut down. Everyone I know has been sent to work from home.

I will tell you the company I work for is massive, and has plenty of money. They are refusing to let us work from home, saying that it is not possible and that everything is business as usual. They have no plan in place. They have not cancelled unnecessary meetings, they are still packing tiny conference rooms full and shutting the door. When the question came up of “what will we do when someone in our office gets it?” The answer we got was; “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” 

My partner is very high risk with auto immune disorder. I am scared to go to work. I have been using my paid time off to avoid the office. It seems like the CEO and higher ups do not give a damn if us or our families get the virus, they just want to milk every penny they can. I truly do not know what to do. I keep taking days off hoping I get an email that a plan was put in place. On a day I did go to the office last week, two people who I work near showed up with flu like symptoms.

0,How do I ask another friend who is my partner’s cousin to be my bridesmaid because the other one backed out?. Bit of a long read sorry.

Now obviously I would be a pretty shitty friend if I wasn’t happy for her and I told her that just because I’m having a wedding doesn’t mean that her life stops so I was so happy for her because she’s been trying for ages and it’s all such a happy time!! There is absolutely no negative feelings or anything like that and I still asked her to stay in the bridal group to share her ideas and stuff and we both agreed it would be best for her to just attend as a guest. Now I still need an extra bridesmaid because my partner still has the three groomsmen on his side and we would both like for the numbers to be the same. So how do I ask one of my other mates to be a bridesmaid without making them feel like they were second-best or anything like that because that’s not the case.?
0,"My wife’s in law school and has no time for us. This is obviously a throwaway account.

Two years ago, my wife decided to go to law school. I told her the only way I was letting her was if she got a full-ride scholarship to a T14. I never thought she’d be able to do so.

So she did, unfortunately for me. She quit her job in customer service. 

I’ve been taking care of our toddler daughter AND also work full time. My job doesn’t pay that well, but the hours are very lenient and enable me to take care of our daughter.

My wife never has time for us anymore. I feel like a second priority. All she does is study all the time. There’s no cheating involved because she studies in the spare room at home, so I know exactly what she’s up to.

My parents are angry at my wife. According to them, she has a college degree. They want her to quit law school and return to her old job, because back then she had more time for us. While she hated her job, once she wasn’t at work, she had all the time for us. My daughter and I both need her in our lives.

This has been affecting me because I agree with my parents. But I know my wife will react badly to it because she’s been doing well so far in school.

I don’t have any particular pain or so. With all this Cvirus stuff i’m extremely anxious and more hypochondriac than usual. Also had some cheese yesterday which i don’t usually eat so maybe that played it’s part.

Already had this sometimes months/years ago, pretty rarely tho. No major complaints beside extreme anxiety and stress due to this whole situation.

I’ve grown fond of this guy, (I’ll call him Ryan) 

It’s been over a month and a bit. Although, Ryan has a girlfriend (they just hit 7 months)

Long story short, there has been two moments where I thought he was flirting (a “friendly” forehead kiss, (a week and a half later) a whistle at me from him when we were leaving the bar/restaurant after having drinks with friends)

Honestly he’s a nice guy, he is! But that’s what I’m struggling with, is he being nice? Friendly? Playful?
I started to realize I’ve grown fond of him, like a huge crush but I’m trying so damn hard to hide it.

What are some mixed signals that could be misunderstood?
Change of tone? (Different tone of voice when speaking with me- sometimes softer)
Random conversation starts? 
One thing that confuses me, he won’t reply back to texts, yet when I leave the building sometimes he’ll text me right after I leave. Like this could be a text from the day before, earlier in the morning, two days ago, etc.
Sometimes I’ll catch him glancing over at me from the corner of my eye, but it’s like he looks and looks away immediately, like to not be caught?

I’m being respectful of the fact he’s in a relationship, no flirting, etc. But...I can’t fucking understand what the hell he’s going with this? Can he like...”man-sense” my crush on him?

0,"What is the random mind game that you play with yourself that has no real consequences but you irrationally still make yourself play them?. I used to think I was crazy until I saw a meme (the one where a couple has thought bubbles and girl thinks the guy is thinking about something inappropriate but he is shown to be thinking an innocent thought) where a guy was jogging past a girl and his thought bubble aid something like “if I don’t run to that tree before that car passes the tree, I will die”.

Does anyone else give themselves these insanely irrational challenges?

The current game I play is when I am folding laundry. I take my clothes out one at a time and when I find a sock, I have the throw it randomly into the pile of other socks. The game starts when I have to match the pairs. I am allowed to use 2 hands, but can only pick up one sock with each hand. I must find a pair without moving the pile. If I accidentally pick up socks that do not match or grab them the same sock with both hands and lose. 

The consequences for losing? I will die in the next 24 hours. My irrational brain creates this absurd consequence. Now that I am 34 and more pragmatic, I penalize myself with having to wear the mismatched socks. 

Other more common examples:
- if you step on a crack in the sidewalk, your mother will break her back
- if you say “Bloody Mary in the mirror three times in the dark, she will appear and kill you” (I literally had a hard time not saying Bloody Mary in my head every time I saw a mirror in the dark into my 20s)
- really any superstition, but I create my own 

Are there any psychologists or psychiatrists out there who can tell me if this is common or not? My self-analysis is that I love puzzles so much that I can turn mundane tasks like laundry into fun challenges. My consequences might be a little harsh though.

TL;DR I invent games in my head that I have to play and superstitiously think I will die if I don’t win the game."

0,"Redditors, how did you cope with work as you prepared to quit. As I’m laying in bed with another cold in the span of two weeks, the idea of how badly I need to quit my job is keeping me away from getting that precious sleep that I need. 

The decision has been made, I am going to quit. 

I am constantly sick. Anytime I’m at work I have backaches, stomachaches, I lose my appetite, I’m moody (even after arriving in the best fucking mood ever). My sleep deteriorates on the nights that I work or have to be at work the next day. My body tenses up. I always feels like crap. After a shift i tend to feel depressed and it even affects my relationships at home. As soon as I leave and I start driving home everything goes away. 

It’s insanity. 

Im done. 

But I’m thinking how can I keep myself sane and healthy (like cmon I need to call out of work again, lose money again and just be stressed about letting them down again) while I transition into a new job?

She will just be really ditzy acting for like 30 minutes then she just switch back to being her natural firmly toned self. It’s really odd. It doesn’t happen often but I know she’s not putting on an act. You can literally see it in her eyes that something is off and I was curious if anyone could help explain wtf is happening lol
0,"Dating during coronavirus. Hey guys,

So I am being extra cautious about the spread of the virus, maybe a little too cautious, and I wanted to ask you guys if I am being too paranoid, and what you all thought.

I have a boyfriend I haven't seen in days and we live apart, he has roommates, and I miss him terribly. I am afraid to go over given everything that is going on.

Would you guys see your boyfriend/girlfriend of wait til all of this calms down?

I probably sound crazy but I want to see what you all think.

0,"What to do?. I’m not entirely sure this is the right portion of reddit for this question but I’m looking for advice on some ideas for a date tomorrow!

The weather and this scare of a pandemic has cancelled a lot of the events I had planned out for us and it’s much to cold and rainy for us to hike/hit up a park.
Any ideas for a meaningful date, I’m really interested in this girl and want to show her I’m an interesting/entertaining person to keep seeing.

0,"Whats the worst experience you had under Anesthesia?. Heres mine...


i had lipo in colombia, and the doctor sorta missed a spot on my right flank which i mentioned and he told me when i come back, hell do a do over ill just have to pay for anesthesia.

Well i did come back, 2 years later. i guess the doctor didnt expect me too. He seemed upset cuz now i was prying into his busy schedule. So he left me as the last patient of the day, mind u there’s a difference btw anesthesia.. either ur awake, half awake, fully alseep. Which all ranged in different prices. For some reason i felt like he was trying to give me the worst trip of anesthesia. By trying to convince to get the half sedated anesthesia cause it was cheap in price. I made it clear i dont care ill pay whatever it took to be fully asleep. Which i did n it cost me 2k which it shouldnt of since i was in colombia. And the price is way cheaper like 800.

Once the doctor came to the clinic, like i imagined he was annoyed which scared me. N i tried bein nice n tellin him im sorry, n plz be gentle with me. I had a friend with me that didnt help much, she was opening a recovery home n was trying to recruit him under her wing as a dr that will refer patience to recover at her facility after his procedures. well she was askin him questions at the wrong time.. she was asking while he was marking my body up with a marker on where to lipo me. He seemed annoyed as hell with her and i told her to leave the room he doesnt seem happy. Moving forward...

I was placed under sedation and when i tell u it wasnt general anesthesia and i was in the twilight zone, i was in the twilight zone forreal. It got so surreal it started off with me hearing music for some reason then with  the beat of the music my vision started to zoom into my body until i seen each of my veins flowing in my body to the beat of this song-which i cant remember what song it was. As it went on i was able to see each of my blood cells moving along my body like traffic on a map/ like ur gps, all my cells was just traveling. It was a horrifying experience.. with the beat math problems started to form all over, like science equations that took hours which is what it felt like.. then i started to feel like i was aware of my surroundings but everyone started to sound like robots around me and I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I started to feel as if i was in a coma n never coming out of it. No matter what i did in my mind nothing was helping. I started to freak out and little by little i started to hear them a little bit better.. i also have terrible spanish which my spanish became great for some reason n i was holding a full convo with 3 nurses that I couldn’t see at all. In spanish i was asking them where is my doctor.. i need to speak to him. He lied to me and purposely gave me anesthesia that he knew would make me freak out. They started to laugh at me and make fun of me. Now i started to cry n tell them why r they doing this to me. They were calling me all types of names, callin me a cry baby and makin sounds like waahh waaah.. mimicking a baby crying. I told them if i ever get out of this blind coma like state im going to see who is doing this to me, that it isnt right to treat patients like this.

I was then focused on sitting myself up without being able to see, trying everything to reassure myself. i wasn’t paralyzed or in a coma. I needed to get out of that situation quick. All the while they were makin fun of me. Im assuming they do this alot to patients knowing when to do so cuz were completely out of commission. N im assuming they do this judgement on how the patient isnt moving so we must b under full anesthesia still but as soon as i was able to move n reach my hand underneath myself n pull up slightly, these nurses changed their tone of voice and the old bat that was mocking me crying n callin me a cry baby in spanish completely became this caring nurse sayin to relax and so forth.. i screamed soooo loud, i screamed in a panic yelling my friends name that was outside in the waiting room she started banging on the door for them to open it and started telling them whats wrong n what were they doing to me. I told her everything and she started to argue with them n told them ive never seen her like this and that they were lying n they had to do something. I couldnt believe what went on and how these nurses changed so quickly their attitude was appalling.

But over all the experience freaked me out. I would cry for weeks about the situation and how i felt helpless and in a coma. Everything i envisioned which i cant completely remember all the details shook me. For months it was damaging to me, ive read on stories with similar experiences where people have committed suicide after an experience like mines, having surgery under anesthesia that u can feel everything n so forth. Guys terrifying experience."

0,"Why do you think footage of Joe Biden touching, groping, grabbing, smelling and stroking children on CSPAN is being suppressed by reddit, YouTube and the news?. I have been banned from several subreddits for attempting to post this link and others like it.

Joe Biden is not the first and certainly not the last politician or public figure to be found abusing children; however, he is currently a candidate for the American presidency. This makes his actions, taken while knowingly on camera, important to discuss.

If this is what is happening on national television, what is going on behind closed doors? And why does no one want to talk about it?

This stuff isn’t made up. This video was not edited to be more damning than it is and it’s not a trick of the light or an isolated incident. This footage is from a senatorial swearing-in—there is other footage out there from other events (although it may be currently hard to find due to YouTube’s algorithms).

0,"Seeking advice!! Traveling in an RV to national parks for unknown amount of time.. Living off 100% P&amp;T while traveling America in an RV for an unknown amount of time.

Exactly what it says. I am asking because my wife thinks I’m nuts (not disagreeing) and wants to see if this even a semi intelligent decision. 

Information about us:
We have been married for 9 years, but knew each other for about 14 years now.
I am make a 6 figure salary and we have nearly no debt. Between my salary and the disability we make more money than we need. We save about 4K a month. I hate my job, really really hate my job. I feel like without the type of drugs I take I would probably be borderline homicidal because I hate people now, it’s not even that I hate the specific individual, I hate that they are in my personal space and feel threatened. Haven’t found the exact space, but much much larger bubble than the space being in traffic on a 6 lane highway. 

My wife sells her photography and handles everything around the house. I have had seven TBIs in my career and bad PTSD so I am quite forgetful and she helps me out with everything. She recently had three hand surgeries on her dominant hand so she is rehabbing currently and really is concentrating on her photography. 

I am ex Special Forces, 18C, important only because it adds to part of the equation of my willingness to take a risk, adapt and overcome. 
My wife has CPTSD and Panic disorder, which leads to her really wanting a plan and sticking to it and everything very calculated.  I am very impulsive now and she has saved us from compulsive deals from $600 to one that was just over $1,000,000 (four plex in HCOL area). 

I want to say fuck it all, sell and what we do not need, store what we do not want to take and travel in an RV. I have never really found myself or know who I really am, I spent 10 years in the military and now I am kind of lost in life. Plus I love nature and the idea of being away from a lot of people. I am going to start astrophotography so being in secluded areas would help that as well. My wife is actually a social butterfly once her guard is down so it is than interesting dilemma. 

We have 40k in savings, after buying an RV, and only $490 in recurring debt. 

RV wouldn’t be anything grandiose, more humble,but we plan on ensuring the main components are ready for our trip and we would spend about 30 days rehabbing the inside. 

We would start the trip in September and go from there. We are in the PNW so we would head south. From the redwoods I have no plans, but again that part is not a big deal to me as we would figure it out. 

The biggest problem is this:

I have NO exit strategy.  I do not really know who I am, what my hobbies are (trying astrophotography because I am interested in knowing more about space). I have no exit strategy because I have no plan in life and continuing down the path of this corporate world is not what I want. This is something I am hoping will help me find myself and be able to do something I enjoy while spending quality time with the person I love the most. 

Seeking guidance please."

recently my car stopped working. i’ve been stressed and out of it for awhile, in between moving and being homeless. maintaining my life has been very very bad the last year and a half as i been trying to get on track mentally and financially. well I took a walk to the store the other day and upon returning home, I spit in the street because of a bad case of cottonmouth. as I did so however, a cop (who I assume was patrolling), drove out a block in front of me, gestured as if he’d turn my way, but turned opposite instead and drove down a different street. now this panicked me because I feel like he saw me spit, and went back and collected it to use to frame me for some crime I had absolutely no part in. i know how bizarre this sounds, but my paranoia is really destroying me unnecessarily, on top of real stresses I already have. what do you guys think?"

0,"We are lost.. Troubled stepson...

Okay here is goes. I’ve been in my stepsons life since he was 4. He will be 8 in about a month and a half. My husband has him every other weekend and sometimes every other week during the summer. In that time I’ve noticed a serious increase of neglect on his moms part, I mean yes she “takes” care of his basic needs but doesn’t think about the emotional aspect of raising any child. So he started showing obvious signs that he’s wanting his moms attention. At one point he started calling me mom by accident and calling his mom by my name as well as being very inappropriate with me. My husband and I had to have a conversation about not touching girls in their “no no spots” because his mother wasn’t. It was also getting to the point he was hurting his cat at his moms house and tried choking my dog while he was here. We’ve broken him of hurting any animal we have at our house but not sure how things go when he’s at his moms. When he is at his moms house he does beat on his little brother pretty bad from what his mom has told my husband. When he was in school, he would throw horrible temper tantrum. A lot of the time they would get so bad they would have to take all the kids out of the room and let him calm down. He has thrown scissors at teachers and bullied other students. All the while this is happening, his mom was always late bringing him into school and also 1-2 hours early picking him up. While I’m first grade, it got so bad he missed 98 days of school for whatever reason. 

Things seemed to be going okay for a year and a half until he started lying about everything and pretended not knowing how to do simple tasks. We’ve had talks to him about it and even showing him countless times. We ended up chalking this up to his moms doing because negative attention is better than no attention. 

We are now battling him wanting to play more than to eat. He would barely eat anything we give him. And when he is hungry, he doesn’t say anything. He is so skinny, you can see every rib and every bone in his spine. We’ve talked to his mom about this and all she says is “he just had a high metabolism.”

So my husband and I had a baby together and he just turned 8 months old. Up until our son was born my step was the only child at our house for 8 years. We can tell he’s having a hard time with sharing the attention. 


The most recent thing that’s most bothersome to me was I found a lego on the floor and with my son being at crawling stage and putting everything in his mouth. I told my step son he has to be careful with where he has his legos and he seemed confused so I explained to him that my son can choke and he goes but I like my legos and I proceeded to explain to him that if my son chokes on one of his legos he could die and all he said was “I don’t care if he chokes and dies cause I don’t care about him.” I was so shocked because he’s got a little brother and a little sister at his moms house. 

I had a serious talk with my husband about my concerns for our son because of his older sons history of violence towards his class mates and teachers. 

I get that he has some issues that need to be resolved with a therapist, even though his mother says he’s seeing the one at his school. I get he’s got some anger built up but I’m becoming extremely afraid he will hurt my son. Both my husband and I have had nightmares because of this. I’m getting to the point where I just don’t know what to do anymore and not wanting him around my son.

We have also talked to him about maybe living with us during the week and visiting his mom on the weekends and he said no he want to stay with his mom. 

I feel most bad for my husband because he’s stuck in the middle but I also feel responsible for the well being of my son. What should we do?"

0,"How would life evolve in a McDonald’s dimension?. **Tl;dr Imagine a world came into existence made of McDonald’s restaurants.  Now, imagine that every animal on earth is placed inside of this universe, along with every McDonald’s employee.  How does life adapt to this new world over time?**



Upon this universe’s inception, all 1.7 million current McDonald’s employees spawn at their workstations in “their” restaurant.  Customers don’t spawn with them.  When an employee dies, they stay dead.


Each McDonald’s in this restaurant consists of the entire McDonald’s property, including the parking lot and drive thru.  However, at the border of where each McDonald’s property would end, are three story high concrete walls and ceiling over the top of the building.  So, there is no sunlight.  The concrete above and below each building stretches out infinitely.  Things like gravity and pressure from this concrete don’t exist.


At the north, east, south, and west sides of these walls are four metre high and wide, square arches, and on each side of these arches is a replica of another random existing McDonald’s restaurant.


Every animal spawns parallel to where they are in the real world.  So, for example.  If your dog was on a boat, with a bird flying above them, a fish swimming below them, and a gorilla five kilometres away from them, then your dog, the bird, and fish would all spawn within the same McDonald’s restaurant, while the gorilla would spawn in a restaurant five kilometres away from them.  Nothing would spawn inside of a wall or object.  Just imagine the entire terrain of earth gets flattened and replaced with McDonald’s chains.


Employees only spawn “once”, in their own McDonald’s, where they work.  So, while each restaurant connected to each other is random, and there are several duplicates of each particular one, there aren’t multiple clones of the same employee in every “clone” restaurant.


The temperatures in the outdoor section of each McDonald’s would be the same heat level of that restaurants position relative to where and when it would be IRL.  So, the parking lot of a McDonald’s in the equator during the day would be the same heat, and far hotter than a McDonald’s hundreds of miles south “in Antarctica”.  The restaurants still have air conditioning.


Plant and fungi spores floating in the air DO spawn in this universe, but macro plants like trees do not, unless they are plants already on a McDonald’s property irl.  No animals spawn in walls.  There is no wind or weather in the parking lot.


Things like food, soda, soap, oil, gloves, paper bags, toilet paper, and water from the sink, magically restocks at the end of each day.  It only restocks to one day’s worth of that resource that that McDonald’s would typically use in one day.


The only natural light sources are the fluorescent lighting and displays like electronic monitors.  The electricity never runs out, but there is no internet connection.  Everything flushed down the toilet gets erased from the universe.


Human tools like phones, glasses, ear piercings, and cars don’t spawn in.  Things like mops, that are used to do the job, do spawn in, as well as stuff like pictures hanging on the wall.

The buildings don’t decay or collapse as they age, like real buildings do.  They also don’t decay radioactively.  There is no problem like heat buildup or entropy.



Questions:

* How would animals evolve abilities like mobility, sight, sound, etc. — is what would everything end up looking like?

* Would humans revert to a hunter gatherer society?

* What would people’s jobs be?

* Would there be a class system?

* What would music be like?  What would be used as instruments?

* How would the environment effect human warfare?

* What would be the primary choice of weapons?

* Would humans have a form of money?  What would they use as currency?  What would be the major products sold?

* What lifeforms would inhabit the play areas where humans aren’t around?

* How would each type of animal fare?  Eg. Dogs, cats, primates, fish, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates?  Birds?  Cassowaries, penguins, songbirds.  Bugs?  Flies, mosquitoes, bees, ants, worms.

* Would birds evolve into raptor-like creatures with opposable thumbs?

* Would any fish survive in the toilets/soda machines?

* What would happen in the restaurants parallel to zoos irl?

* How different would it be from life in the infinite Burger King universe?

* Would Ronald McDonald, Grimace, etc. become deity-like figures?

* What would humans evolve into over time?

0,"CoronaVirus Michigan Mid-December Story. Nobody believes me but I believe I had the coronavirus Mid December in Michigan. It started with a sore throat one night at work. Pretty much leading into a really bad cold starting the next morning. I worked at a place called Zingermans Mail Order in Ann Arbor, MI overnights. My position had a lot of dust in the work area so I would wear a N95 mask to cover my lungs and protect from dust mites. One particular night my throat began to hurt I figured it was dry and I was thirsty. Kept drinking water never got better got worst by the end of my shift. Following the next morning I called off for my shift. I figured the dust made me sick after searching symptoms. Within the next 3-4 days my cold was horrible and my throat was super sore, I had lost my voice and sounded terrible, I had a very bad cough that literally wouldn’t stop. I play basketball and workout everyday but I would run out of breath from simply talking or walking or running very short distances. My body was aching and sore. During the night when I slept, I would begin sweating and take a cover off and then within 10-15 minutes I would shiver and be cold and go back to wrapping myself up. I was sweating so bad my sheets would be soaked and my chest was slippery. I went to the doctor they told me I had a virus from basically a normal cold and a fever but I did not have the flu. I was given medicine but after continuously taking it I barely got better. At my appointment I was told if I didn’t feel better in 3-5 days return to the doctor. Finally one day I started feeling better and went back to work the following day. The same night by the end of the shift I was back in the same position except worst. My cough was non stop, my fever was back, my body ached, my nose ran non stop with sneezing, I still didn’t have my voice back. I could barely finish one sentence and I was out of breathe. I told my girlfriend I believe the dust mites scarred my lungs, because I can’t breathe the same. I went to an urgent care (Different doctor)after a few days and informed them I went to the doctor previously and the symptoms have persisted for atleast a week and a half. I was wheezing, coughing, and had shortness of breath. I was treated with a Nebulizer which is an breathing treatment that expands the lungs and I used it for about 15 minutes. Directly after I felt great but later on my symptoms persisted for about 3-4 more days. Finally I got well and it was the sickest I ever had gotten. Due to me believing it was dust mites I quit my job at Zingermans. I have a girlfriend named Isley who can vouch for me and my experience, although she doesn’t believe it was possible I had Covid-19 because she thinks she would’ve gotten infected and sick. I might even have text messages from my co workers still explaining that I was sick! I promise I couldn’t make this up. Do you believe this is possible? Share my story please!"

I need some clarity on my life.

I am 29 years old and I grew up in an Indian family raised in America.  I love my parents a lot, but I often feel like there is always pressure to maintain cultural values and to be honest, while I don't necessarily think Indian Culture is all bad, I don't believe in a lot of the traditions and customs, but I do appreciate other things like food, art, medicine and music.

Yes I already know my parents want the best for me, but I just can only accept that as an excuse so many times.

My mom keeps asking when I'll get married and she asked why I would not want to meet someone through parents circle of friends and what is wrong with sites like Shaadi.com or bharat matrimony.

Here are my reasons I'd never want to meet friends through parents network

1. If I say no, my parents will say I'm being too picky and my dad will start getting confrontational and it'll lead to all sorts of arguments.
2. Someone else will get hurt and my parent's friends will get mad
3. Even if I did manage to meet them, there is almost always some sort of 3rd party involvement and they will always want to know how it's going and keep tabs on whether the relationship is on track towards marriage instead of them minding their own business.
4. Most Indian girls my age or younger are not going to want to be setup by their parents anyways and I prefer a strong independent woman who can think for herself.

Here is why I absolutely hate Shaadi.com or bharat matrimony.  

1.  It is shallow - I once created a fake account to see how it really is and I had to list my salary on there.  Most of the profiles on their started with ""I am finishing my Masters in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the end of May and looking for husband with good family background.  

I have no information about their personality, interests, hobbies and who they are at the core.

2.  Half of the profiles are made by Parent's themselves.  This was a major red flag for me because either the woman is way too lazy or just doesn't really care about she ends up with because if she really did, she'd make an effort herself to at least make her own profile and also she's more than likely traditional if she's ok with that and I don't want a traditional indian woman because I don't want a woman who's willing to say ""yes"" to everything just because I'm her husband, it's fucking stupid.  Also there are parents that make these profiles and their children don't even know they are on it.  I'm not talking to parents.

&amp;#x200B;

   3. If you're looking to meet someone and date them for a couple years before even getting married, it's very rare to find someone like that on these sites.

&amp;#x200B;

  4. People get married based on Education, family background, wealth and even caste.  

First of all everyone and their mom has a college degree these days and a good job, it's much harder these days to attract women based on those two things than in the past because women don't need a husband in their life to manage and they are more independent than ever.  

Also notice, I didn't put romantic and emotional attraction on there because they are trying to logically match with someone based on the other points above and emotional and romantic attraction takes time.

5. These sites take the fun out of dating.  Dating is about meeting people and connecting with them on an emotional level and when all you think about is wanting to get hitched, you don't even take the time to enjoy and appreciate the moment in front of you.  

Dating is much more rewarding even though you'll get rejected, but you become emotionally resilient through it, but you'll also find amazing women who you truly connect with and that's really important.  Even if it doesn't always lead to a ring on her finger, those experiences shape and they don't go to waste.  

My mom looks at dating as a formality and a tool to develop into marriage while I view marriage as a right of passage rather than a goal.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my my answer to my mom on these two questions, I also added that ""I don't owe anyone an explanation on why I do or don't want to do something.""

FYI, these are my experiences from these sites.

Here is another point I'd like to make

My parents paid for my college and I am truly grateful for them for that and everything else they've done for me, but when it came to allowing me be my own man and have my own views of the world and live by them, I never had that opportunity.  I know some people might be thinking I'm lucky for parents paying for college, which I am, but I always felt like I had to manage their cultural expectations and I just can't do it anymore.  It takes a toll on my mentally and emotionally to the point where I feel like I'm always limited.  Sometimes full independence is taken for granted and that's more valuable than money.

I do feel like because they paid for my college I feel obligated to manage their cultural expectations but at the same time, I also realize that I'm an adult and I'm fully independent and it's not my job to manage their cultural expectations.  I feel like because I made something of myself and I'm not violating any basic human principles not cultural or religious values, that I did my part.  

Here are examples of cultural expectations I don't agree on

1. No Pre-marital sex
2. No live-in relationships
3. Being married by a certain age

In my opinion I don't feel I owe any obligation because they paid for my college at this point since I'm financially independent and have my own place.

At the end of the day, I don't want to be 55 and angry and resentful towards them because I feel like I'm there already.

Here are the questions I have

1. Are my answers justified above for questions regarding matrimonial sites and meeting people through family friends?
2. Even though my parents paid for my college, am I still obligated to meet their cultural expectations even though it's subjective?"
0,"How are you dealing with parents or other family members that believe Trump is handling the coronavirus response well?. As the question implies, I’m dealing with the Fox News crowd. It’s infuriating to hear them say the president is saving lives.

A little background before I start...
This is a throw away account and I only have it to get genuine advice. I’m completely serious and I would appreciate everyone to not judge me to badly...
Okay to start off, you may be wondering what my previously mentioned addiction I have  acquired, the answer being pain. I am extremely addicted to pain, at least I believe so.
Growing up, I’ve always been fascinated with the idea of personal pain. I can remember that most of my early childhood was spent sitting on the ground near a fence so ants could crawl on and bite me. It may not sound like very much, but it slowly became more and more extreme. I would pull my teeth out with hangers and mess with permanent ones just because it hurt.  I’d also look forward to getting hang nails as well as those little flappy pieces of skin on your finger. 
As I stated before, it grew more intense as the years went on. I was soon sticking sowing needles, paper clips, and clothes pins deep into my arms and hands. And before I knew it, I was cutting my arms and legs with knives and razor blades. My mom actually began to catch on to me because of how often I wore long clothing despite being in a place that is really hot. She found out and put all the knives away (which I responded to by cutting small chunks of my tongue with kids scissors)
I would go through periods where I’d starve myself of food as well as water just so I could have a migraine. I went to such lengths as to make myself vomit just because it felt good. Though I have had difficulties in the past concerning my weight, but it seemed like  a less important thing to me at the time. I’m actually still suffering from a iron, vitamin B, and vitamin D because of my poor eating decisions.
I am to afraid to report this to others around me (Such as my mother and psychiatrist) because my sibling had gone through a phase where she got into physical fights and my mother was forced to send her to a mental hospital for 2 weeks. She always tells me how bad it is and that I should avoid it at all costs. I really don’t want to experience that so I refuse to tell others because I fear I might be sent to a mental hospital as well...
Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!"

we need help, we need for you to spread the word so more countries are beware of what the fuck is going on here! We are the only country which has given up the fight for corona. Because the authorited simply can not cope. they only protect the people who work in hospitals and elders. Nobody else. 

this is a serious violation of humanitarian principles. we don’t know what to do anymore! 

SWEDEN WILL NOT ATTEMPT ANYMORE PREVENTIONS TO THE VIRUS!
SWEDENS AUTHORITIES HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP!

PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD SO THAT CAN CHANGE!

BREAKING: Chinese media attack on Sweden

“Sweden’s surrender to the new Corona virus will harm others and themselves

Swedish officials decided on the 12th to stop the statistics of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia, and the country will no longer test patients with mild symptoms and suspected patients. An official in Stockholm said it was no longer possible to stop the spread of the new Corona outbreak in Sweden. The country's public health agency said it would use its limited resources for high-risk groups such as medical staff and hospitalized patients.

Sweden is the first European country to openly surrender to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, and this country's latest policy is highly irresponsible both for protecting the health of the Swedish population and for working together to fight the global epidemic. A total of 635 cases were diagnosed in Sweden by the 12th, of which 135 cases were newly added on the 12th. This is a very serious situation for a country with a population of 10.12 million.

However, in terms of the level of public health development in Sweden, it is far from being exhausted. In Hubei Province, China, there have been many cities with a population much smaller than Sweden and medical standards lower than Sweden. There have been many more cases than in Sweden at present, but those cities have not given up, and they have recently zero new cases.

Sweden did not attempt to carry out further prevention and control mobilization, it directly gave up its comprehensive resistance to the epidemic, narrowed the anti-epidemic front to a small part of the hospital, and only protected patients and medical staff in the hospital. Laissez-faire is a serious departure from the law of epidemic prevention.

Sweden is acting as an ostrich. In this way, the epidemic situation will need to be further outbreak in Swedish society. More and more patients in critical condition must be hospitalized, and the country's medical system will be under more pressure.

Promoting such a decision is a serious violation of humanitarian principles, and it would be shocking to see it happen first in a developed European country that advertises ""democracy"" and ""human rights.""

In doing so, Sweden is still demolishing and releasing water from the global epidemic. It means that Sweden will be a country where the new Corona epidemic is unrestrained and most cases will lose epidemiological tracking. Sweden will become a black hole in the international fight against epidemics, a hotbed for virus accumulation and attacks on other areas.

In the future, Sweden will pose a huge risk that is difficult to assess in Europe and the wider region. There are many more cases in other countries, but at least it is clear, and Sweden will become a complete mess.

The international community, especially the European Union, should severely condemn Sweden's surrender to the virus. If Sweden's approach is accepted, the world's already fragile anti-epidemic front will break further and collapse, and the long-term consequences will be unimaginable.”"

We’re thinking whether we should do it or not amid Coronavirus scare. We’ve been waiting for the trip for a long time now, but obviously we want to make the most informed decision possible. BA hasn’t cancelled the flights yet, but they just issued free-of-charge rebooking or a voucher policy, if we were not to fly. 

I’m concerned for our wellbeing, but I’m definitely not panicking yet, just trying to understand how bad it might be if we were to fly, or how likely it might be to have some problems while in the US (quarantine or something).

Closed on a job before you leave? 

My husband (30/M) and myself (28/F) currently live in our home town and we’ve been married for 6 years. He has his family here and is close with them and I have mine here as well and am extremely close. No children for us at the moment so my nieces and nephews are my life - Unfortunately I am incredibly tired of where we live from the weather, to feeling like you can’t walk into a Safeway without running into 3-4 people you know. 

I don’t want to super get into details about where I live but I live in the PNW (Pacific North West) and it rains, is cold, dark sometimes and we (mostly me!) need to get out of it. After going to Hawaii in 2017 and Florida this past September 2019, we know we are people who need THAT weather. I am aware of island fever, and the hurricanes and elements but I just need a warm tropical scene. I need the beach, sun, palm trees and warm (and yes HOT!) weather where I’m outside at 9:30PM on the front porch because it’s still warm. 

There is a bit more background to this whole thing but I wanted to give a quick summary to show how much my husband and myself want to up and move to somewhere that best fits the weather and environment we so crave. A small portion of this story also is my husband waiting to match for medical residency so I’m afraid to move and become very happy and find out we have to move to like Chicago for his residency. No hate on Chicago, go Cubbies!! 

Any input would be great and I’ll try and comment as much as I can and give extra background info anyone might have :)

Asking out of genuine curiosity and also disgust. Why do you feel the need to stock up on toilet paper?

I understand many people are having irrational urges to a highly unusual situation - our (US) government is giving virtually no fact-based response to the spread of COVID-19, and so there are no other sources of public leadership guiding us through a proper response to it. 

But why the toilet paper?  I assume you, like me, have been exposed to post-apocalyptic fantasies in books and movies- I always thought food and a clean source of drinking water would be the highest on the list. I literally could care less what I wipe my ass with. Plastic bags (RIP, NYC), magazines, newspapers- anything that doesn’t cause a rash. Why are you so friggin’ obsessed with soft, white paper for your chocolate starfish?

Personally, I would be stocking up on highly caloric foods (rice, beans, oils, sugars) and wiping my ass on literally anything I had at hand when nature called. Now I, just trying my best to deal with your panicked bullshit, can’t even by a package of toilet paper at the grocery on my way home from work. 

So, why?"

I don’t even want to be in this class anymore because it makes me feel sick to my stomach whenever I think of the situation. I went to a school counselor and they said I should be fine and most likely nothing will happen once I have a conversation with the professor. Any advice?"
0,I’m not Biphobic right?. Ok basically I recently got asked if I was homophobic and I said fuck no I am totally cool with that stuff but I did say I guess I am Biphobic because I’ve had a lot of bi people fuck me up and they ruined my perception of Bisexuals but she said you can’t hate all of them because of a few experiences. I agreed but I still have a hard time trying to get along with bi people due to my past. I don’t know what to do and I hate that she thinks that i am ignorant but in reality I am right?

0,"I become extremely inferior to angry customers. I always forget what I’m doing, making me look even more like an idiot, which makes them even more angry. How do you cope?. I only work at a grocery store, but I’m in nursing school trying to get out of retail and into a better paying job. The unfortunate thing is, nursing does involve dealing with a lot of people. Only reason I mention it is I often times self loathe about how if I can’t handle a stupid grocery store job, how am I going to handle being a nurse? Often times I feel like the idiot of the department. I’m quite slow at understanding things. I think being aloof would be a perfect word to describe me, always in la la land. My words don’t come out the way I want them to. I am easily a ball of nerves, a wreck.

Because of the coronavirus, my grocery store has been wiped out. A lady came by and to my mistake, told her some products were included in her order when they weren’t. It was my fault I didn’t read what was on my phone correctly. But of course she had missing items, because we had so many things out of stock, even peanut butter for goodness sake. She went on a tantrum demanding her things. It was like unleashing a wild snake, extremely authoritarian. All that was left for me to do was bow down and kiss her feet for her to spare me. Now, I used to be even worse in handling these types of situations. I’d run away and cry. Being in retail for 7 years has given me a bit of an advantage to handle my social anxiety and emotions a tad. I guess that has come with age. But what I have a hard time doing is forming coherent sentences when confronted by said vicious snake since I am still pretty nervous. It’s always the same looking Karens doing this to me, but that’s besides the point. 

I feel so defeated when I can’t handle my “battles” and need to call a manager or a team leader, who are all practically my age or slightly older (I’m 24). It’s embarrassing having to pass on my problem on to someone else, who already has enough to deal with on this hectic, busy day. My coworker handled it so effortlessly. The lady was going off about multiple things that far exceeded what the original problem even was and she calmly looked at the snake, laid out some facts and talked to her in a confident manner. Did she end up winning her over and made her happy and all was good? No. She still left pretty ticked off. But what matters is the snake got taken care of, and me, well I felt so ashamed for not being able to defend myself. I kept thinking on wether I should have admitted to misreading her order, or try to emphasize that we don’t have many of the items she ordered and apologized. 

When people get too overwhelming for me handle, I have this urge to run away. Either that or my body wants to literally fight if I can’t get away. It’s awful. And I feel too stupid and unintelligent to find a conclusion, a clear answer to provide that makes logical sense to calm her down! And for goodness sakes I need that to be a successful nurse! I’ve been putting myself down on how terrible I am at handling other human beings toddler tantrums. I feel doomed.

TL;DR I have never been able to handle a rude or angry customer successfully. I always have to pass it along to someone above me within my job. I feel too stupid and unintelligent to ever figure out the right solution to their problems, or how to shift my focus from wanting to run away/fight, to thinking about how to correct the situation. It makes me feel like I won’t ever be competent enough to be a nurse when viewing the flaws that I have when working in a grocery store. I feel doomed and like I won’t ever learn how to defend myself and not turn into a useless piece of garbage."

I also joke around constantly without any reason. I am a host at a restaurant and with almost customer I greet, I have a joke answer for everything. Sure they laugh and they go along and we have a good time but I feel like I do it too much. I also do that with the co workers and they don’t joke back and I feel annoying almost

0,"So I have a question about Covid. So I was thinking the data for countries vary by country because of the % of people  they test. From what I’ve been reading on reddit a lot of places are just not testing people until they’re like really showing severe signs, and even then sometimes they are denied.

So I’ve also read about the amount of testing South Korea has done after the religious group made the virus erupt there.

“A nation of 51 million, South Korea has tested about 250,000 people since its outbreak began on Jan. 20, with a daily capacity of 15,000. It has conducted 3,600 tests per million people compared to five per million in the U.S.”
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free

You could say, look at China they have the most people tested. Yeah, but the whole reason this blew up is because of their lying and lack of care early on, trying to cover it up. So I don’t believe a word China says.

The question is, wouldn’t South Korea be the best place to look at for things like death %?
I ran their data based on what is on worldometer.
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries


When I checked their cases were at 8086 while deaths were at 72.
Ran the math and it came out to be .89% let’s be safe and just round that to 1%.
I know 1% is high but still a lot bette than what other places are showing, 3-4%.

0,"I’m 18, just lost my first daughter due to stillbirth and don’t know what to do with my body or life. Help? Advice?. I’m 18 and just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. She was born sleeping so obviously I didn’t get to bring her home. I loved being pregnant and I love my baby still, but my lifelong dream is to be a mother and a gardener. I was close to being prepared fully for my baby. She came pretty early at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation (I was 8 months pregnant, basically). Her father was extremely abusive towards me and actually tried to strangle me multiple times. Naturally, I left him when I found out I was pregnant. We rekindled later in the pregnancy, he figured out where I had moved to and came up to “see me”. No matter how many times I said “No, let’s wait, let’s be sure this is a good idea”, he would not listen. He never took my feelings into consideration. He called me crazy for worrying about the things I would worry about (him hurting me after pregnancy). 

I’ve always been very in tune with my body. I know when something is wrong, whether I acknowledge it or not. When I was pregnant, I tried to stay as in tune with my body as I could. I ate as healthy as possible (a cheeseburger here and there never killed anyone), I sat down when I needed to, I napped when I felt I absolutely needed to, I counted kicks and made sure she moved. 

The night before she passed, I had a TON of cramps out of nowhere. Moving around didn’t help, drinking didn’t help, I told her dad I thought I needed to go to the hospital. I might be in labor. I had been very stressed with him and for some reason the whole week I kept saying “i’m going into labor soon. I don’t know when, but soon” no one believed me. He didn’t then. He said I was fine. They eased up after about two hours. I pushed it off as just Braxton Hicks. I had been having them for a while before then, it was way too soon to be in labor, right? That night when I laid down for bed, she was moving, as usual. I overslept and woke up the next day at 3pm. I went pee and noticed... I was spotting. I panicked and called the hospital and they told me I probably just lost my mucus plug, no need to come in, but start getting ready for a baby in the next few weeks. My body hurt and I couldn’t eat. I felt hot and dizzy but didn’t even think to check my temperature. That night by 8 I sat down to count kicks because she wasn’t really moving and I honestly wasn’t paying attention. I waited for an hour but there were none... she usually moved by the first second I would lay down. I knew right then something was definitely not right. I called my sister and told her to take me to the hospital. We went in and at first they didn’t think anything was wrong. They set me up on the monitors and thought they had a heartbeat but it was irregular. It would skip a few beats. They called in for an ultrasound and at one point she turned the monitor away from me, wiped me up, then left the room, didn’t say anything. I looked at my sister and just KNEW there was something definitely wrong. The nurse came in, pulled a chair up, all I could think was, “please just say I have to do a C-Section. I can take that, I’ll take it”. That was not the case. There was never a heartbeat. They caught the placenta, not her. I lost it. I couldn’t believe what they said. I just kept repeating “are you sure? can you check again? you’re positive?”. She told me things like this just happens sometimes. My body went numb. I started dry heaving because I was crying and shaking so badly. They moved me into a labor room. I was dilated 70% and was, in fact, in labor and had been since the night before :) funny, huh?

I sat on the bed, they left to get me a new gown because the IV was leaking out of my arm. All I wanted to do was scream. Instead, I continued to sob and ended up vomiting. I puked so violently I broke my water but I sat there, I thought I just pissed myself. I didn’t give a shit. When they came back and I stood up, there was a puddle of blood and fluid on the bed. I sobbed out, “ What is that? What’s happening to me?” They continued to dress me in the gown and told me my water just broke. I cried even harder. I had to deliver my dead baby, how the fuck was I supposed to do this? I called her dad in because he oddly brought me comfort and I wanted him to be there. If she was alive I wouldn’t have done this, for both of our sakes. 
She came the next day at 1:25 pm. She was gorgeous. The cords weren’t tangled, she came out easy, she was just perfect. They sat her on my chest and I never wanted to let her go. I wanted so bad for her to just burst out screaming but she never did. They washed her and dressed her and wrapped her up and handed her to me and when I situated her in my arms, air came from her lungs, I smiled and thought “she’s going to do it!” but it was just air. Nothing else. The entire time I got to be with her I prayed she would wake up. I didn’t want to accept she was actually gone. But she was. 

Fast forward to now, almost two weeks later. I broke up with the dad for good. And I found out the placenta was infected and that’s probably why she passed. It could be just an infection or Chlamydia, which is funny because I have been with the same sexual partner on and off for well over a year now. He was persistent that I was the one cheating. But the thought of even having sex while I was pregnant felt so wrong and two weeks before she was born I got tested for STDs. I was clear. I slept with him a few times after that and then this happens. I feel so betrayed and so... cheated. Cheated out of everything. I just wanted a baby. I’m considering a sperm donor just because I don’t want the drama of a partner. I don’t want to go through that again. I will strictly stick to sex toys if it means I can be a mother. Hell, I’ll be abstinent. What should I do?"

Dear Student Service 

I am disappointed in the way of online classes been hold. The poorly designed online classes just make me come to the class and risk my life because I can get better quality of classes. 

Issues

1- poor camera position 
2- I receive no emails regarding to online class meeting code 
3- Poor and faulty app for online Streaming 
4- Teachers won’t read the chat room to answer the students questions since there three or four people are setting there and ask no questions. 
5- Student uses voice chat to make noise 
6- There is no file or save of online classes anywhere

Dear Amin

Thank you for your feedback.

I would highly recommend you talk to your instructor about it as simple adjustments may resolve the issues you brought up.

Besides, I would like to let you know that we are assessing improvements to the classes offered online as we go. Unfortunately, the first few classes that happen online may not be perfect.

Amin
I do not appreciate your tune, nor the way you talk to our staff. you need to realize your place and who you are talking to.
I'm going to let it go this time and consider the fact that you are very new to the country and do not have enough communication skills.

Having said that 
1. We did not promise any online course (YET)
2. In spite of the communication that the regulatory body sends us from Health Canada, which is persisting on not canceling any class or event, we chose to let students decide, as an adult, whether they want to attend classes or not. We decided not to penalize students for attendance. if you are so worried about your health, despite everything that all health and education regulatory bodies say, you can stay home and study on your own. you do not have to risk your life to come to school. mind you that going to a supermarket may be much more dangerous than coming to school.
3. Delivering a class on a streaming service was JUST a favor. if you did not like the quality, read on your own. Thanks for your suggestion but we certainly are far more capable and experienced than you think and we already purchased the proper tool and we are testing it. Bear in mind that we are NOT an on-demand supermarket to order whatever you wish, any time you wish it.
 
In the end, I suggest you watch your tune and read your emails a few times before you hit send. this may be the greatest lesson you learn from our school."
0,"Telemedicine - is it going to be big in the future?. Hi wonderful people of Reddit - 

With the rising COVID-19 pandemic, it’s becoming more and more apparent that certain health and medical practices may need to be overhauled or restructured in the future such that we are better equipped to face emergencies. One of the biggest issues, especially in America, is insufficient access o care - especially in rural areas.

Telemedicine/telehealth applications have been around for some time and seem to be growing in popularity. r/AskReddit - do you see telemedicine as becoming more widely used in the future? Why or why not?

Do you have any experience using telehealth in any form now? There are a variety of apps available including Curology, MDLive, Dr. On Demand, and the Ro Health triad - Roman (for men), Rory (for women) and Zero (for smoking cessation).

I’m especially curious to know if anyone has had experience using any of the Ro Health apps, which seem to be lesser known, and what their user experience has been like. 

Looking forward to hearing new perspectives! Cheers!"

Besides, I would like to let you know that we are assessing improvements to the classes offered online as we go. Unfortunately, the first few classes that happen online may not be perfect.

I do not appreciate your tune, nor the way you talk to our staff. you need to realize your place and who you are talking to.
I'm going to let it go this time and consider the fact that you are very new to the country and do not have enough communication skills.

Having said that 
1. We did not promise any online course (YET)
2. In spite of the communication that the regulatory body sends us from Health Canada, which is persisting on not canceling any class or event, we chose to let students decide, as an adult, whether they want to attend classes or not. We decided not to penalize students for attendance. if you are so worried about your health, despite everything that all health and education regulatory bodies say, you can stay home and study on your own. you do not have to risk your life to come to school. mind you that going to a supermarket may be much more dangerous than coming to school.
3. Delivering a class on a streaming service was JUST a favor. if you did not like the quality, read on your own. Thanks for your suggestion but we certainly are far more capable and experienced than you think and we already purchased the proper tool and we are testing it. Bear in mind that we are NOT an on-demand supermarket to order whatever you wish, any time you wish it.
 
In the end, I suggest you watch your tune and read your emails a few times before you hit send. this may be the greatest lesson you learn from our school."

0,"person walking outside of apartment. so I woke up to the sound of someone walking right outside my apartment door, my dog was barking like something was up. I got scared and called my mom. She told me if I thought it was serious I should call the cops, so I did. They came but my building is locked, I said a prayer and went to unlock the building door and saw that the front door was propped open by a little dog statue. I saw the same statue a day ago, my new neighbor was using it to keep the door open while he moved stuff in. I thought it was weird but I was like okay whatever the neighbor must be moving stuff in? The cops and I never even interacted and they just left claiming they checked the premises. It’s been like half an hour and this guy is still walking up and down the hall, just creeping me out. Who decides to start moving at 3:30 am? I can’t sleep and my mom isn’t answering her phone."

Well thank god I don't live in the US (I'm Canadian), but still, this is gonna suck big time. But then, I thought that Trump's presidency would serve a superior purpose afterall: a painful wakeup call to American citizens. 

As his term slowly comes to an end here I've realized that this hasn't really been the case, and American Trump supporters are blindly loyal despite his completely heinous actions and just his personna. 

Is covid19 the wakeup call that America and the rest of the world need?"

0,"What’s wrong with me?. 
I am a 21 year old 6’2 college basketball player and have been told by many women that I’m very handsome. I’m blonde, I’m nice, most people don’t have anything against me, and I’m just a well known and like-able guy in general throughout my community. I am not mean to others. I know this has nothing to do with the title so far, so I’ll get to the point. As I said I’m well known throughout the community, a lot of people know who I am and what I do. So I am not lacking friends or anything, I have the friends I need and nothing less. What I can’t understand is why sometimes when I’m with a group of friends or with a friend that invited other finds that I do not know, I go mute sometimes. When I am only around the select few people that are my “friends”, I am talkative and can easily carry on a normal conversation. But when I get in groups, it’s almost like I have no confidence or I feel like I might be judged by something I say. So I go mute sometimes. When this happens, I feel like people get the idea that I’m mad or just not having a good time or do not like them, but that’s kotd it at all. Even if they are friends of my friend and I do like them, I might not talk much because I don’t now them very well. And it’s not just that I’m quiet, it’s that I really go into mute mode and don’t say a word. People may think I don’t like them when this happens, but really it’s just that I don’t feel comfortable to talk or only feel the need to say something when it needs to be said. Everyone tells me I’m quiet. Not at first, but as they get to know me they eventually tell me I’m a quiet, low-key person, and I don’t know what to think of this. Is it a good thing. Bad thing. I don’t know. I know I need to work on my socialization skills, but I don’t know where to start. Most people would just assume I’m a normal dude that’s not socially awkward or anything. I wouldn’t say I’m socially awkward, I just literally do not talk if I don’t feel the need. I can talk with girls fine, random people fine, but it seems that when I get with a group, my confidence is shot and i don’t know why. I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas of what I can do to help myself. Or if there is actually something wrong with me like anxiety or depression. Thank you"

0,"Boyfriend and best friend dislike each other ... a lot. Some context before I launch into everything: my best friend and I have been friends for a little over a year now. My boyfriend and I have been friends five years and are going on six months dating. He’s also been one of my best friends these past couple years.

When my bf and I first started dating he and my friend (who lets call Kate) actually talked and got along. Sure it was kinda awkward but they texted sometimes and talked irl, etc etc. So it was all ok. But then I think Kate started to get jealous and she already has a strong personality, but then this jealousy made it over the top. She makes snarky comments, belittles him and me, will yank me away when she sees we are holding hands— the works. My bf (who we will call David) has no tolerance for that sort of attitude, and now it’s turned into a vicious cycle of them making nasty comments to each other and just ignoring each other. 

The problem is they both want to be around me, and all three of us have the same classes. It has come to the point where class is hard to manage bc the tension is awful. And David even mentioned how he’s considered just going and sitting with other people and not showing up for lunch anymore just to escape it. I totally get that— he seems absolutely miserable and it makes me feel bad bc I feel like I’m keeping him in a situation that I know he hates. So I told him that he really should just do that bc seeing him that way pains me and he doesn’t deserve to feel that way. And then maybe that way Kate will cool off too and won’t feel the need to make the comments she does. 

Ideally, I want them to at least tell each other where they stand in the hopes that SOMETHING can be resolved. Overall this situation makes me so sad and anxious and idk what to do about it. I feel like messenger between them and the reason that two people are so unhappy. Does anybody have any advice as to how I can approach this? Should I ask them to talk it out? Should I say something to Kate? Any help would be appreciated  x"

I’ve seen people speculate on TV and the Internet that the lack of testing in the U.S. means that the reported cases may be significantly lower than the number of actual cases. I think there was an Ohio health official speculating, for example, that 1% of the state has the virus already. If these speculations are correct, it seems like there would be an increase in the number of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms. I’m hoping docs, nurses, PAs, etc. out there might be able to weigh in on whether that is happening...  Thanks!"

0,"Dear Redditors, when has a teacher made you say, I hate you? REPOST. Here is my story! (Yay!)

So it’s 6th grade, I’ll call this teacher ST (Stupid Teacher) 

Some backstory: My brother (my twin) has been in the hospital due to sickness, I’ve been on calls with my mom and taking care of my little brother, so homework would be done at around 11pm at the earliest. I had to go to school to pick up my brother’s homework. So, I would go to school sleep deprived and depressed. And this is where the story starts.....

It’s the beginning of math class which is 2nd Period (for me, that was at 8:40-9:20, really early.) I was exhausted and my friends recall me at a point having dark circles. Anyway, I tell ST that I didn’t finish the last problem completely and then asked if I could finish it while she’s going over the homework. ST says no, and I’m not very surprised with this answer. (She had been saying that for days on end now.)

Skip ahead to when ST starts to go over the homework, she very loudly states as a reminder(and I remember this because of how much embarrassment and sadness I had at the time) that we need to FINISH our work to get full credit. As ST is saying all of this, she has been looking at me. Then she says this: “Kraken is a great example of this! She didn’t completely finish her homework like she should have!” 

At this point, I feel absolutely terrible as my classmates know what’s going on with my brother. She then gives the homework back to everyone and gives me a 50 on it. I ask ST if I can explain myself because she hasn’t gotten the hint yet. 

I tell ST about my brother and she tells me that I should be focusing more on my homework than my brother who was two days from dying of sepsis. I then recall breaking down as I walk into my ELA class for third period. 

(You thought it was over? I wish.) 

My homeroom teacher (we’ll call her FT for favorite teacher) noticed this and walked next door to see if anything had happened. They talked for a while and I still don’t know what she said to this day.

FT told my class that we would be doing this reading worksheet and that we would be working in groups. In my group was BFF (u know that already) and AK (annoying kid). AK would make me constantly uncomfortable and to this day he still does. Anyway, they’re reading and I’m really quiet (because I’m still in shock) and AK yells at me, “Can you read? Or do you miss your dead brother?” One, he isn’t dead and he’s perfectly fine a year later, and two, yes. I do miss him. 

BFF tells him to be quiet and we get on with our class. After class, BFF told me that AK was spoken to and that FT was handling everything that happened.

So yeah, first post"

Now a week later the place still burns and tingles, and I have a headache that spreads from the place of the hit to other places on my head, the sensation is like burning, but not that strong.

I did not have any nausea, dizziness or any other issues at first. But when my head hurts now I feel just a little bit dizzy. I am also very upset, but that may be just the way I react to things. The.moment I hit my head I felt angry at my stupidity and I have been feeling angry and upset since.

I tell ST about my brother and she tells me that I should be focusing more on my homework than my brother who was two days from dying of sepsis. I then recall breaking down as I walk into my ELA class for third period. 

(You thought it was over? I wish.) 

My homeroom teacher (we’ll call her FT for favorite teacher) noticed this and walked next door to see if anything had happened. They talked for a while and I still don’t know what she said to this day.

FT told my class that we would be doing this reading worksheet and that we would be working in groups. In my group was BFF (u know that already) and AK (annoying kid). AK would make me constantly uncomfortable and to this day he still does. Anyway, they’re reading and I’m really quiet (because I’m still in shock) and AK yells at me, “Can you read? Or do you miss your dead brother?” One, he isn’t dead and he’s perfectly fine a year later, and two, yes. I do miss him. 

BFF tells him to be quiet and we get on with our class. After class, BFF told me that AK was spoken to and that FT was handling everything that happened.

So yeah, first post on r/AskReddit!"

0,"People who have experienced sleep paralysis; what is you NOT scary experience? (Serious/NOT SCARY replies only). Every time I have had sleep paralysis it has been terrifying, but not in the sense that there’s a demon that’s scary and creepy and trying to get me.

My visual hallucinations are fuzzy but it’s always the same couple of things. It’s all either:

1) Four people, a small girl with high energy running around excited “showing off what she can do” by sending tingles down my arms and legs, a teenage boy she calls her brother falling her around and laughing with her, and two elderly people sitting in the background watching over them like parents. 

2) Just a voice telling me “Everything’s ok. You’re safe. Yes, we’re real. We’re real, don’t worry. You’re safe..” Which is creepy but it’s never said in a tone that is intended to scare me, it’s calming and comforting. 

What is your experience with “friendly” sleep paralysis?"

0,"26F Struggling to overcome co-dependency with friends &amp; family.. 26F I have struggled with co-dependency since middle school. I would always have at least one friend out of my friend group that I gravitated towards more than the others. I don’t know why, but we’d just click and I would have feelings of wanting to always hang out with them, jealousy when they hung out with others, envy when they got into relationships. It’s gotten a little better since being an adult but now I’m experiencing those co-dependent feelings again. 

I have formed a close bond with one of my cousins and have lived with her since moving to a new city. After a few years she will he moving out soon because she’s ready to live alone. Completely understandable, but I’m feeling super anxious and sad about it. I fear that once this happens our bond will diminish. That’ll be forgotten about if I’m not around everyday.

0,"Redditors that are High School Dropouts/have GED, what difference did it make in your life and what advice do you have for high school kids?. My son is 16 and has major depression and has been diagnosed bipolar type 2.  I’m trying to help him. He hates the system of school so much and I can’t say I blame him at all. I want him to stick it out and finish—two more years of school. He’s is pre-AP English and AP History, but we dropped him to regular algebra and chemistry because of his absence when he had to go to the hospital with depression. He’s extremely good at writing and analysis. He is a fast reader but doesn’t read for fun because, you guessed it ... school. He makes music. He produces his own beats, adjusts them and what not, and writes his own lyrics, records and he’s on all the music platforms now to get exposure. He wants a career in music and film. He is in Advanced Theater and his art work for art class just qualified for State in Texas. 

I don’t want him to drop out. I offered him an out by telling him look, if you hate this place so much, I’ll see if I can do an at home/online school for you. He hates that idea too. I don’t know what to do! He says he’s given up on education. He doesn’t talk to his dad. His dad would blame me for all of this. My son told me if he lived with his dad he’d have already killed him self by now.  

TLDR: So fellow Redditors, if you didn’t finish school or had an alternative way out, what is it like? What did you go through? What advice can you give my son?"

If they were an alcoholic, or an addict of some other kind, it would be my responsibility as a close friend to reach out and offer help in whatever way I can. With all the body positivity stuff that’s been going on recently, I feel awkward and afraid of the conversation. 

Don’t get me wrong, we should be happy with and love ourselves, but we should also take care of our bodies and live healthily when possible. I have seen how they shy away from intimacy due to their weight. I know they have body image problems and health problems from it already.

0,"Six Degrees of Separation. So i was thinking about this theory today and I realised (whether its correct or not) that the theory has to be true. If the average person knows about 600 people (said so on google so it must be right, do not contest me) then each of the 600 people you know, knows another 600 people. You do this 6 times (Cause of the 6 degrees of separation) and you have a rough understanding of the potential amount of people who are connected through just 6 connections. Well to find that out you could just do 600^6 which gives you 4.6656x10^16 which is over 4.6 trillion. So of course the six degrees of separation will work on a population of around 8 billion, because the population is smaller than 6^600. The only way this theory wouldn’t work is if the population was larger than 4.6 trillion- which first of all I doubt would fit on earth and plus Idk if the math is even correct.
No idea if someone has already made this argument tho."
0,I got caught with weed in a military bag. Can you give me advice on how to pass this period and surpass my sober thoughts?. So my parents smelled my car which I smoked a few puffs in it 3 days ago and were suspicious of Marijuana. They questioned me and searched my staff and found about 2g in my military bag. I've been smoking pot because it helps the mandetory military pass by easier and faster as I have only 5 months left. It also helps me edit and I get more work done with it. I work on visual effects and animation and trying to learn new shit sober by yourself when you're out the army is a test of patience. With weed I have patience and I actually enjoy my long ass editing sessions. They got my car keys and visa so I cannot go out the house after coming back from the army. They also send me to a psychologist which I absolutely hated because she prescribed me zannax and I couldn't believe it. Their initial reaction was very bad and they were saying that they don't wanna support my uni education in London which starts in 5 months. That was just a temporary reaction though. It seems everything will be fine as long as I don't use it in their house. My plan is to just use alcohol and maybe some nicotine to fuffil my need of euphoria and less stress since I can't go out with friends and I even told them that. I just feel hopeless at the moment because I feel prisoned 247. I'll sober up for the next 5 months and continue use in London as the police is not concerned about pot there. Also my parents would not complain as much if it was legal in fact my mom told me I can move to San Fran when I grow up and smoke it but not as long as it is legal. Can you just give me some advice about how to feel better in the army without going out at all and having no weed. All in all I know that it's just a waiting game till I go to London where I'll start a new chapter paying for kush myself and my parents won't be on my ass about my decisions but it will be a rough few months.

0,"Advice on what to do with my sister [18]. This morning her friend messaged me on facebook telling me that my sister is warning them about her being suicidal upon concern. I was honestly not surprised because she said the same in front of my parents and me. Honestly she’s really the spoiled type of kid you won’t ever want to be with—she gets everything she wants upon requests, treats my parents and my baby sister [7] shitty, and even has the nerves to steal money from my parents at times. 
I discussed  this to her friend and she agreed that she is indeed toxic and spoilled. Her friends stopped seeing her after she left the groupchat they have. 
She said she felt like a really entitled kid, expecting her friends to sympathize with her when she feels down whenever my parents scolds her for doing stuff she shouldn’t such as failing classes (tuition is really expensive and she goes to an exclusive school), being really really lazy, and even physically and verbally abusing our 7 years old sister. Her friend told me that my sister was telling them she was abused by an ex and uses that statement as an excuse to everything calling it “emotional trauma”  as I asked her friend to elaborate my sister’s so called trauma, I realized how familiar it is given that she used MY EXPERIENCE and lied straight to her friends faces. Recalling my own experience hers. One time she even blackmailed an ex  of her to buy her some expensive makeup then mailed the thing with my name on it—my parents who received the parcel was shocked because it had my name on it and the sender was another guy they thought I was seeing other guys while i’m engaged.
She’s becoming more and more toxic just to make things favorable for her and my parents only knew the tip of the iceberg—they only know that she dislikes my baby sis and is really rude at times. They are not aware of how toxic and manipulative she is. I feel like they should know so they can take actions on it. 
If I ratted her out, chances are my parents will think I favor her friends over her and at the same time will be mad at me for covering up that she had a boyfriend. (we live in Asia so it’s a big deal) and also our relationship as sisters will be more scarred."

0,"Am i at fault ?. Hey guys. i want to ask everyone’s opinion about an incident  i am still shaken up about. I was driving into work this morning and the first 10 min of my drive is single lane going both ways and the speed limit is 40mph. There are a lot of residential streets off of this central road and therefore lots of people turning onto this road while you’re traveling down it.

It has a lot of hills and a lot of residential street roads directly over the hills that you can’t really see until you’re over the hill. It can be kind of tricky in the mornings when everyone is trying to get to work and pulling off and on this road. Traffic is frequently bad but this morning there were almost no cars and traffic was very light. 

I JUST came over this somewhat blind hill that has a residential street just over the top of it that you cannot see till you crest the hill. Someone pulls out in front of me from a residential street just as I’m coming over the hill. Maybe 60’-75’ infront of me but I’m traveling about 44mph and he JUST pulled out so I’m coming up on him pretty quickly. Whatever, this always happens on this road. i press the brakes rather hard to slow down. Everything is fine. Plenty of distance. BUT, there was a car behind him turning out of the same road who pulls out maybe a second or two later without barely stopping at that stop sign or looking to see if anyone was coming. This person is pulling out EXTREMELY close to me and causes me to slam on the brakes and i get very very close to the back of their car bc I’m basically going from at speed to 10mph over the course of 1 second. The woman rolls her window down and gives me the finger. I’m now coming off of her to a safe distance after nearly running into the back of her. she slams on the brakes to brake check me after the entire incident. I have no where to go, i have to swerve into the oncoming traffic lane just to avoid going into her back seat (if people were coming i would have just hit her). She kinda moves off to the right so I’m not totally in the oncoming traffic lane after realizing what’s going on. 

She follows me the rest of the way because now I’m infront of her. She proceeds to take a pic of my license plate as i do hers. But I’m shaken up, i was shaking the rest of the way to work because i feel like i almost got into a pretty bad accident. I didn’t yell at her, scream, flip her off, was very calm the whole time but don’t feel good about what happened at all. 

All of this happened over the course of like 15-20 seconds. 

What’re your thoughts on this incident?"
0,"Why would I self isolate?. I have an honest question that worries me and I'm not trying to be mean.  If I am told to isolate for 2 weeks, that's two weeks pay I don't get.  If I don't get paid I can't pay rent and get either evicted, which now makes it impossible to isolate and makes me homeless.  I might be able to make a car payment but me and my cat and my stuff can't live in my car.  Also since I'm now evicted, I have that on my record making it impossible to find another apt that's not in the ghetto.  Also, I'm a student who goes to a prestigious school with a 4.0 double majoring in cell bio and chemical engineering.  My degree is set such that if I had to drop my classes this semester, it would prolong my degree by a full year due to certain classes only being available certain semesters.  Also I would lose my scholarship making it impossible for me to afford next semester making me have to drop out, potentially ruining my life and ending my aspirations and career goals.  I talked to my University and they told me that's what would happen unless a percentage of the student body became sick forcing them to shut down.  It would actually be advantageous to me, if I get sick, to not tell anyone and try to purposely infect as many people as possible in my school.  This would shut the school down.  The best possible outcome for me, if the virus spreads here, is that as many people get sick as possible in my area shutting down banks, my apt complex, my school, and work.  I think the apt would have a hard time legally and financially evicting everyone.  I just can't see a reason, personally why self isolation or even going to the Dr would benefit me.  Also, I did get very sick 2 weeks ago and the drs refused to test me, so there's that.  I was actually told to go to work and school if I feel better.  There have been 80 suspected cases in my area, but doctors are refusing to test making this seem like not a big deal if everyone gets sick anyway."

0,"What’s your view on sex?. I’ve been talking to a girl recently who I like, and I’m pretty sure she’s down to have sex but I’m struggling to decide if I want to. Until this point I always thought that sex is only for when you and your partner love each other, otherwise it’s not good/right, but she’s of the mind, you don’t have to be in love and casual sex is normal. I’ve talked to other people and they have told me that sex is just sex and that I’m over thinking it.

0,"He’s never orgasmed with me, stopped trying to have sex, and is sexting other women. I’ve been dating a guy for about 6 months now. Our first date, we had amazing for hours and discussed sex a lot. There was definitely sexual chemistry there. The first time we were drinking, so I didn’t think anything of him not coming. He has never  come with me, or in front of me!

Anyways, fast forward to about 1-2 months after we started dating- sex and any form of it just died down. This was to the point where he would ignore my sexual advances through text, ignore nudes, literally turn over while I’m blowing him, etc. We started having sex maybe once a month and most of those times have been a two minute session where he loses his erection after or is “tired.”  We’ve talked about the sex issues and I keep telling him... he needs to try to work on it, but he has just shut it out of his life.

Also, I have met his family and friends. He calls me his girlfriend, but we aren’t exclusive. I saw him on tinder through my friend’s tinder, and was surprised he was still on there. He ended up telling me it was because he was bored and he wants to take things further with me so he’ll delete it. I told him I can’t and won’t deal with other women, and he assured me that won’t be an issue.

Presently, it has come to my attention that he has been talking to women. I immediately ended things. This led to him saying he doesn’t want things to end and needs a few days to think through things and speak to his new therapist. We had an explosive fight and he said the talking has been ‘sexting women’ to get off since he can’t get off with me. He has told me that he has such a huge mental block and a muddled view of me after not being able to come. He doesn’t know if he is sexual attracted to me, or maybe friendzone concerns?? He also is frustrated because sex is important to him, and he has stuck around because everything else is great. 

I know it sounds like something I should have given up on a long time ago, but I’ve never felt like this with a man before. Everything is perfect, but the sex thing has just been a huge issue and seeped into more than just the sex area. I have given him the final I am willing to still stick around but you have to TRY. I do feel like if he tried- first mentally then physically.. our sex would be amazing and he would orgasm eventually. He said some honest and harsh things today about sex and me, and about committing to me. Now he is going to talk to his new therapist about this and see what sort of resolution he can come with. We are down to: is he going to try or not. 

Also, even though we don’t have sex.. he will randomly finger me, but even that is starting to piss me off. I wish he would go down on me but hasn’t in over 2 months. He said he’s been lazy and he will next time he sees me, but still hasn’t.  My sex life has never been like this with past relationships. So, I am at a loss, feeling neglected, sexually rejected, and not good enough. 

Do you think hope is lost? Do you think he can ever come with me if he tries to work on it? Is there any point in trying since we are perfect other than sex? Please help me!"
0,"Should we pay my stepson an allowance when he rarely helps out around the house?. My partner’s 14 year old son has recently come to live with us. He was removed from his mother’s care by child protection due to emotional abuse, psychological abuse and social isolation and we are working through all of that plus some issues such as gaming addiction, school refusal, social awkwardness and a lot of learned helplessness. He has been through a lot of change moving to a new area, leaving his mum, starting at a new school, making new friends and so on but so far he is coping well. 

When we used to see my stepson every second weekend a few years ago we had a job system where he would get paid $3 for each job. We did ask that he do 1 job a day (Fri - Sun) so that he learned to contribute to the household. He was always a bit lazy and we would have to nag him to do his jobs. Since he’s come to live with us we have kept the same job system ($5 a job now) but without the requirement to do 1 job a day as there were bigger issues to focus on such as getting him to go to/stay in school without the added stress of nagging him to do jobs. If he needed to buy something he could do jobs.

He is still very lazy so he never makes his bed, cleans his room or anything like that unless he’s desperate for cash. We have problems getting him to do basic things like have a shower (he’ll stand under the shower but won’t use soap or shampoo unless we tell him to) and brush his teeth. We’ve recently bought him some kittens as he used to have pets at his mother’s house and he loves animals, but we have to nag him to help feed them or change their litter (when we talked to him about getting the kittens he agreed that he would help out with these things).

He is not good with money either, he spends it as soon as he gets it. When he wants money it’s usually at least $20 so that’s 4 jobs. He’s too lazy to do 4 jobs in one go and gives up after 1 or 2 and then starts begging for an advance (which we say no to, been burnt before when he conveniently forgets and we have to nag). We’ve suggested he do 1 job a day and he’ll have $35 at the end of the week but he doesn’t want to hear it.
 
We also have an achievement system in place for school. Last term we gave him monthly rewards for attendance (he was doing half days) and a big reward at the end of term and he made it through the term without missing a single day. The rewards are either a gift, an experience (eg: escape room) or cash and range from $30 - $50 for monthly and up to $200 for the end of term rewards. This term the achievements are for doing full days at school and he got $50 last week for his first monthly achievement. He has also asked for an advance on achievements which we say no to.

Now he’s demanding we pay him an allowance without him having to do any jobs at all. We don’t think this is reasonable given his reluctance to even look after himself properly let  alone do anything that benefits others. We need to be firm with him just to get him to grow up a bit and not be so helpless but we also worry that we are being too hard given all the issues he’s had.

Does anyone have any advice?"

0,"How can I permanently get rid of my oral thrush (candida). I’ve been stuck with oral thrush for over a year. I got it initially from using metronidazole for a cdiff infection. I’m only 20 years old and before I had a relatively healthy immune system. Since then I’ve been feeling foggy headed, severe allergies, bloating and almost flu like symptoms. I’ve tried 6 different antifungal medications, none of them worked. I’ve tried fuconozole multiple times and other mouthwash/lozenges. I was treated for it for the first 6 months by my ENT doctor but he told me I need to see my primary doctor because he can’t figure it out. My primary doctor refuses to believe that the white stuff is thrush because “it’s not bleeding” and there’s “not enough white stuff”, I told her that I see white candida spots/ strings in my feces regularly and she told me to see my gastrologist. My gastrologist didn’t acknowledge the candida fungus and instead had me tested for worms. Every doctor seems to be in doubt except for my ENT he knows for a fact that it’s thrush based on my symptoms and because he’s seen the growth himself. I’ve tried pretty much every known suppliment you can buy at the store. Rescently I’ve  had the best luck with oregano oil, lavander oil, garlic, and multivitamins. I also rinse my mouth with coconut oil and saltwater regularly which works really good. No matter what I do it still comes back. I’ve tried candida diets but I need carbs or my immune system get worse and thrush stays the same. If anyone has an answer to this on what I should do I would highly appreciate."

I had a unique job at my organization, and wanted to ensure my work was handed off responsibly.

I got avoidance and clear cold shoulder office politic nonsense for a few days, then sat down with HR and my department head yesterday.

2. it could’ve just been the animation style, but if i can remember correctly, it was clay stop motion

0,"How do I calculate how much I should be paid for developing a web app. I want to develop a website for a cinema in Maputo (called Lusomundo), where a user can find all the information relevant to a particular movie all in one place.

As of right now, everytime they have a new movie, the only information they release (on their Facebook page) are the locations, date, and time of the movie showing. Reservations are made by calling one of their establishments and talking to a real person, which means only one reservation can be made at a time. To find how much the ticket costs, you have to personally go to one of the establishments and ask, or search through hundreds of comments on one of their posts to find out.

0,"AITA for not working things out. So a little over two years ago I was a single mom of two going through school. My ex of 10+years had cheated on me. Lots of anger and gaslighting and lies on his part. We tried to work things out, but he cheated again and we parted ways. He had a lot of issues after but that’s a different story. 

I started to do things for me again and in that I met my now boyfriend (well I guess ex boyfriend). We started out just flirting when I would come shop at his store, then as casual (but amazing) sex. And between that and talking to each other literally every day, we became best friends with real feelings and started what at the time was a great relationship. We were happy, never argued, loved the same things, hung out with great friends, it was perfect.

Except that he never wanted to admit to people at work that we were dating. We were just friends or roommates. He wouldn’t go onto social media and post things with us or anything like that. The reason always being he wanted to keep things private because having people in his business before had caused issues in other relationships. So I was just patient, didn’t want to rush him. He was choosing me and my kids so I thought I should be understanding too. That and I know his background, he had a hard childhood and I understand him being scared of letting people in and relationship things. 

Fast forward a bit and we really don’t have sex anymore. Which is ok but it was something that changed. He was being kind of off at times but I chalked it up to work stress. Then one day he was gone and had left his old phone lying around. I look and there’s all these messages to and from other girls, explicit stuff, flirting, him meeting them etc. One of them was even someone I knew and was acquaintances with. I confronted him and he denied it up and down, said he was hacked, that that’s why he needed a new phone, that he loved me and would prove to me it wasn’t him and I gave him the chance. 

Things never really recovered. It was about every month I would find something. Whether Facebook, phone, whatever. Just constantly finding messages to other people, one had a dick pic that I know was his shorts, underwear, blanket. One woman, who was fucking married, even acting like she was about to have his baby? Always the same excuse from him, that he was hacked it wasn’t him, he wouldn’t do that. I don’t know why I stayed as long as I did. Because I was so doubtful but it honestly didn’t line up with how he was at home. He cares for me, the kids, it didn’t make sense. We still didn’t have sex but we kept arguing so of course we didn’t feel up to it. 

Over a year and a half in and we tried to just reset. Things felt so good, we were happy and doing family stuff. But on a whim I looked and he’d been texting the pregnant chick. I looked at his phone and there were naked pictures of her WHILE PREGNANT. And I was ready to be done but I got so scared that I was wrong and he was telling the truth. That nothing happened and he had kept them to show her husband. 

Again. Idk wth is wrong with me other than being scared to hurt people and make my kids sad and being alone. Because typing this it’s pretty glaringly obvious that I was a naive idiot. 

So anyway. That was in November. Fast forward to now and I haven’t really seen anything. I did find snapchat on his phone once with messages to someone completely new but he denies it. Up and down that snapchat was ever on his phone. 
Deleted it so whatever. 

Well now. After I decided to just stop giving a fuck about any of it because hey, he’s here and he helps me so it can’t be that bad and if I find anything then that’s that. But even without finding things shit has been bad. We’re best friends but still arguing about things. He’s always irritated and angry. Reading into little things. I bring up the things that bother me and that I want to try to fix and he brushes it off. 

Now I’m ready to be done and we argued the other day, and it ended with me telling him I wanted to break up and him leaving in the middle of the night. He came back wanting to talk about things, and I felt bad because it’s freezing so ok. Tells me to please just let him work on things, let him be the man I fell in love with again, let him prove to me I can trust him. 

I was tired and felt so shitty I figured we could try. But by now I’ve at least messaged a couple of the girls I’d seen messages to. One confirmed that they had sex, the other that he had tried to and at least kept messaging her u til she’d blocked him because she figured we were together. So I tell him he just needs to figure things out and go and that I’m not going to try to fix things with him. We go back to he’s sorry, he’ll do what I asked. He didn’t realize how bad he was treating me but he doesn’t want to lose me. 

Finally he admits to having sex with the one chick but still flat out denies anything with anyone else. Even denies that they had sex more than once when she said about 3 times. Says he never asked for it when I know I saw him text her asking if they could have sex again before she moved. So he’s still not giving me the whole truth. But begging me to work on things with him. Even if I. The end I feel the same way he wants to try and be a better person for me. 

I still said no, every time. Eventually he gets angry and starts yelling, flipped a chair over. He goes on for a bit being upset but calms down fixes the chair. I go to bed and he stays on the couch. 

Typing all of this and thinking about everything I know the right answer. But for some reason I still feel like shit that I won’t work on things, that I won’t get to have my best friend that I thought I had before, and I woke up and still just missed him laying with me. So idk.. AITA? 

Tldr, breaking up with boyfriend who has cheated and still won’t be completely honest, he wants to prove he can be better but I don’t want to work on things. AITA."

0,"I beat up my abusive ex becoming he abuser. I don’t know what to do with myself or what to think.. TLDR: My ex boyfriend was abusive and I snapped, beating him up becoming the abuser myself.

To start with I am a horrible person, and ashamed of myself and I just selfishly need to get it out somewhere as it’s eating me up. 
I beat my ex up last night. I completely snapped and lost it. I have no idea who I am anymore. 

For some background I realise now he was abusive, and I don’t know why I didn’t realise it, why I justified it or tried to help him become better. But he completely stripped me of my self worth and dignity. He is currently seeing a psychologist for his narcissistic personality disorder. And for the entire relationship I wanted to help him be better and have a healthy relationship. He was selfish, ridiculed my body, picked me apart, told me I’m worthless, other people are better than me, blamed me for his actions, never sincerely apologised, refused to communicate, talked over me constantly and invalidated my feelings, twisted my words, gave me the silent treatment for days, ruined my reputation by lying about me to the people around him especially family who have threatened to hit me and verbally abused me, talked about private matters to others, shown my vulnerable text messages to other people in front of me and laughed making fun of me saying I’m overbearing and crazy, such as when I’ve been having a panic attack and seeking reassurance that I’ll be okay, or after asking him if he wanted me to to grab something for him which he would read and then I would ask “Why aren’t you responding? It says my message was read? Are you busy?” To which I never got responses I still would waste 20 minutes waiting just in case he was busy and did want something. I just ended up not texting him anymore if he didn’t respond because I would come home and he would say he just forgot to respond to me whilst being on his phone, constantly. He lied about everything even to the point of even lying about touching the door that he slammed against me, dumped me and kicked me out of our house after raping me as I wasn’t on the lease.. I begged him to care for me and love me and I chased him. We got back together. And I continued trying to have civil conversations with him about how I feel due to some of his actions. How certain things are mean, hurtful and not okay, ect. He admitted he enjoyed hurting and upsetting me, invalidating me used me as an emotional punching bag and drained me of my emotions and patience on purpose because he felt empty, that he escalates conversations into arguments to be in control. And I stayed, which is definitely entirely my own fault, I did it to myself. I think I deserved it, and I know no one else will ever love me or tolerate my flaws whatsoever. I don’t know why I am this horrible, how I didn’t realise it. 

In the past week he has escalated things. Telling me he hates my skin colour, my hair, my face, my body, I need to wear heavy makeup and dress sexy, that his sisters best friend he has a crush on and always flirts with and stalked on social media is better than me and I should be like that. That I am an option not a choice daily. Purposefully lied about being in love with his ex, and then said it was just to upset me.

I will also add that beside all that a lot of my  built up resentment came from bottled up incidents, the rape and the fact he has thrown hard objects at me, punched me multiple times in the abdomen, shoved me against concrete walls, tackled me and thrown me to the ground countless times in the middle of a conversation that he attempted to escalate to which I kept saying to “stop, please don’t raise your voice and be aggressive towards me,” and followed me when I tried to walk away, left bruises from grabbing me, partially dislocating my finger once which he then squeezed as hard as he could again. I felt my joint pull apart again and somehow by only sheer luck it went back into place. I never hit him before this. He was a judo state champion in his youth, and is currently bodybuilding and 50kg heavier than me, the only self defence I know is boxing and karate from when I was a kid and teenager. 

To the actual act, it was last night. We were going to have sex. Why? I initiated as it’s the only thing that makes me feel cared for or wanted while happening. He wasn’t getting hard and I know he likes porn a lot so I offered to have sex while watching it. We put it on he got hard and he pushed into me without foreplay which I expressed hurt me, then proceeded to have the laptop placed over my breasts and face, he came inside of me within a minute. This is the second time he’s done that but this time about 10 minutes afterwards I asked if he enjoyed it and he told me he would have loved to been fucking her instead, she’s better than me. He takes at least 40 minutes with me doesn’t get hard for me, ect. 

I snapped, it felt like my whole body ran cold and numb and I lunged at him to slap him. He did his usual hip throw and I instantly become completely consumed by rage when he grabbed me, I rolled out of it off the floor and came at him full force, he didn’t do anything but have a guard up at this point and I completely railed on him, forcing through his guard with relentless full weighted fast punches throwing fakes to lower his guard cutting up and bruising both his cheeks, he picked me up and threw me down again trying to hold me in a lock with his entire weight and strength this time with an elbow on my my neck, holding one of my hands, I dug my other hands knuckles into his throat leaving another bruise. He let me go and we stood there for a few seconds I felt immense anger and nothing at the same time. He said “You’re lucky I didn’t smash your teeth in” I yelled “GO ON THEN!” and lunged again, I held onto his the back of his neck with my left hand and elbowed him at least 10 times with my right. I let go roundhouse kicked him in the side of the head and then grabbed him again and kneed him in the stomach and ribs at least 5 times. I don’t know why he didn’t hit me this time like he usually does. 

I completely and utterly attacked him with full intent to hurt him and I do genuinely feel absolutely disgusted in myself, and yet somehow still, like he deserved it even though I certainly know, no one does. And that makes me feel scared of who I’ve become. I know I should be charged with assault and I have no idea what to even feel or think at this point. I used to think I had a strong sense for right and wrong, for justice, I’d never hit anyone hard, I could never bear to hurt anyone while sparring. I would walk away. I clearly don’t though. I know I did something horrible and absolutely, disgustingly, wrong. I feel completely broken and ashamed about what I did, for hurting him, for wanting to, and I should be held accountable for it. Can some please tell me what do I do now? How do I process my heinous actions. Despite the reasons I snapped it was entirely my fault, and my actions that were wrong. I’m lost."

New account for this question. 

2 weeks ago my father had a massive heart attack. Although he was medically insured my family is still afraid of the potential medical bill we might get from the hospital and/or ambulance. Unfortunately we also learned via mail that he had a debt from car loan. However that car was returned to the dealer by him last year after he realized he could not afford that car. Because my father was secretive man my family did not know about this loan and subsequent unpaid debt. My mother is elderly, she is afraid of getting her house repossessed (both her and my father own the house) over the future medical bills and this debt collector letter she received today. What are her options? Our options?

PS My plan was to call the debt collector let him know i want to set up a payment plan to avoid any harm to my mom. Same with the medical bills."
0,am I really just dumb and selfish?. My stepsister and my stepmom always yell at me over things that I forget to do like household things.

My laundry basket isn’t really a basket but with clear squares in it it doesn’t have any cloth. She then comes into my room and yells at me for being so thoughtless and inconsiderate for moving her laundry into my dirty laundry basket. I didn’t think it would be a big deal because my laundry basket is so big with holes and it doesn’t have any fabric covering it. She said she felt disgusted and how f*cking annoying it was. I said sorry and she just left my room. She then yelled at me more for not coming out and helping her to fold her laundry. It didn’t cross my mind that I had to go help her fold her laundry because of this. This seems all so stupid but this is stuff that I get yelled at for. I always get called thoughtless and dumb and why I don’t think. I really don’t know if it’s because I’m selfish and I only think about myself or if I’m just slow or never was taught

He’s done so many thoughtless things in our relationship, like many people do but through patience and growth we’ve learned to move pass them. However, I was at my wits end when I saw him checking up on an old crush of his and found out he had looked up other girls too. I broke up with him but a day later he asked me to lunch. We talked made up and two days later I found up he was looking up other girls the day we broke up and he went to the bar but he never did anything with them. No texts or meetups. We worked it out but ever since then I stopped putting the same amount of care that I had before. Yet, if you asked him things are better than they ever have been and they do feel easier and more natural. But that’s probably because I’ve been going out with my friends more and I get a lot of male attention. I went dancing with my friends and she was hooking up with this guy who invited his friends and they basically took care of us the whole night. Kept dragging us away from men who couldn’t take no for an answer. It was unofficial so we went to a party after and I danced with another guy and it was honestly the most fun I’ve had in a long time. Went home to my boyfriend and was passed out for the better half of the morning. He found out I danced with another guy and I was like yeah I did and he was like “well now you know how it feels to make slip ups and I hope you won’t hold me to such a high standard anymore”. And he also said “if our roles were reversed what would you do?” And we both agreed I would of broken up with him, but he didn’t do that. I’m not used to being the one who crosses a line in relationships and even though nothing more than dancing happened, it’s fair for me to say I don’t dance with just anyone. I believe it to be deeply intimate and sensual. The vibes were just there I guess. I guess my point is are we just staying together because it’s comfortable? Why didn’t he break up with me?"
0,"Incredibly strange guitar amp problem. So, I will try to explain this as easily as possible, but it’s an odd situation.

I just sat down to play and plugged my Orange CR60C into the same power strip I always use. My amp would not turn on. So, I plugged into two other spots on the strip, still nothing. I unplugged the strip, tried the amp on both of the plugins directly into the wall outlet, still nothing. I tried it in an entirely different wall outlet in a different room, nothing. BUT, I tried it on a different outlet in the same room as the original power strip, and BOOM, the amp comes on... this makes no sense to me. Also, let me add this, every other device I have will work on the outlets and strip that the amp won’t. Any advice/help is welcome. Please help me out. Is this my amp or the outlets?? I’m so confused.

TL;DR: guitar amp works with only ONE wall outlet in my house, but no others, even though other products work on all outlets."
0,"Modern vaccines keeping the youngest generations from getting the corona virus?. I did some side by side comparisons from an idea I had. I was also confused as to why this was effecting just the older generations and all I could think of was the vaccine chart of the late 40’s. By the late 1940s, scientific knowledge had developed enough, so that large-scale vaccine production was possible and disease control efforts could begin in earnest. I checked that one as opposed to the schedule chart from 2010 until now.

Late 1940s | Recommended Vaccines Smallpox Diphtheria* Tetanus* Pertussis*

0,"Why do “southerners” do that?. Hi everyone,
I should lead in with saying that we are originally from Germany and live in the US (NC) now for four years. We love it here!

Still, two things that we have a hard time wrapping our head around this are:

1. Everybody always says “let’s do this, that and the other together”, but nobody ever follows up. In case you have something scheduled and one party has to reschedule or cancel, it is always on us to propose a new date. Otherwise we will end up with “let’s get together really soon” and then the whole relationship dies with that. 
2. Recently, I try to sell some of our stuff online on different platforms. I have many people asking questions, but then I do not hear anything ever again. No thanks, but no thanks or anything. I also scheduled to meet with people and they just did not show up and never sent a message.

People being forced to stay in designated areas. Curfews.  People being forced out of their homes and taken away. It all really reminds me of of a lyric from Deltron 3030. “Global controls will have to be imposed, and a world governing body will be created to enforce these. Crises precipitate change.” Seems to me that all of this is a way to force new rules and control over people. Not saying this virus is not a real virus, just saying that it all seems a bit strange. Anyone else see this all as a way to force control over people? Lol not being crazy just think it’s all a bit odd. Also if you have never listened to Delton 3030, check it out."
0,Overnight workers of Reddit... what does daylight saving time do to your hours?. I’ve always wondered about this.

0,Are there actual benefits to chamomile?. First off are there proven benefits to chamomile such as relaxation. Second off should I of used “is” instead of “are” in the question?

0,"Am I getting scammed?. I have a personal google business page where I sell my paintings. About 3 days ago I received an email that a man wanted to buy one of my paintings. The grammar in the email wasn’t great, but his email named said his name was Mario Andreas, so I assumed english may not have been his first language and dismissed it. He said he wanted to get one for his wife for their anniversary and said she liked my work. (Mind you; I’m not a well known artist. You can’t google ‘artist/paintings’ and my page will come up.) I’ve been on the cautionary side, and he hasn’t mentioned anything that was too strange like asking my personal info up to this point. The only thing that really raised a red flag for me is that he said his budget was 2k-5k and my paintings are clearly priced on the site and none go above $200. I’ve been humoring him up to this point and sent him an image of a new painting I just finished that is considerable larger than the others, and told him it was $1000, along with one of my smaller ones that is complete and ready to be sold (for $150). I’m going to paste the last response from him here.

 I just want to know if anyone thinks this is a scam. I obviously would not accept a personal check (cashiers check only); and not send my personal address or cell. (No alteration to grammar or spacing has been made) The last email is as follows:

Thanks for the message,  I must tell you I intend to give my wife a
surprise with the immediate purchase of the piece. Also If you'd like
to know, I'm relocating to the Philippines soon and our wedding
anniversary is fast approaching. So I'm trying to gather some good
stuff to make this event a surprise one. I am buying this (2 images)
for
$1,150 as a gifts to her.I'm okay with the price, I think it's worth
it anyway, so I'll be sending a check.

As regarding shipping, you don't have to worry about that in order not
to leave any clue to my wife for the surprise. as soon as you receive
and cash the check, my shipping agent (who is also moving my personal
effect) will contact you to arrange pick-up.

I would have come to purchase the piece myself but, at the moment, am
on training voyage to the North Atlantic Ocean (I'm an ocean engineer)
with new hires who are fresh from graduate school and won't be back
for another couple of weeks.

Regards,



PS: In the meantime, kindly get back to me with your full name (you
want the check payable to) cell phone no. and contact address
(preferably for Usps ,fedEx not P.O box) where a check can be mailed
to, so I can get the check prepared and have it mailed out to you
right away."

(A test drive before the midterms come creeping near). 


The whole time I had this productive rush of just wanting to learn something.
Anything I could get my hands on was the most interesting thing that ever existed. My mind was clear and focused and for the first time ever, basically any subject I touched, even the most mind-numbingly boring ones, were so intriguing.
Usually when I can't understand some part of the study materials I get frustrated and give up, now it was ""YAAAH I'm gonna be +20 smarts if I figure this out"".


For the first time in my life I understood why it's easy to get addicted if there's no caution.

0,"What do you suspect the charge for this is?. So my girlfriends brother let’s call him ‘jack’ has been hanging out with this guy, let’s call him ‘Derek’, who has been dealing him ICE. They’ve been smoking it together for months however Derek decided to tell jack what was really happening with him.
Now Derek sells ICE to many people, so he’s got himself a reputation by the locals and the police. He has been in and out of court (he’s getting 100% time in jail) but the system want more evidence so they push back his hearing each time.
The police have resulted in using drones to watch my girlfriend, Jack, and their father. Not only this, they often have people following the truck around the place due to it being jacks car.

Very recently, jack fucked up. Derek was due to be in court and jack was supposed to be there with him to support (jack left earlier than the court time) . But instead of doing as he was supposed to, Derek sent jack a message saying “the second I’m in court they are going to raid my house, can you drop by and clear some shit.
I’ve got bullets under the floorboards under my bed, ICE in the ceiling and pipes in my backyard” and he replied with “yep no issue”
Jack of course drove over (first mistake) only to find that the cops were already there. Upon pulling up, the police asked for his name and he told them and they did the typical “you can’t be here go away” and so he left... around the corner to change his court clothes of which a police car then pulled up behind him, wondering why he’s still there.. they ask to search him because he is acting suspicious.. and he said no, because I’m not getting arrested. 
They then push him to the ground (ripping his clothes) as they patted him down. They searched the car and found a taser that Derek had given jack.
Fast forward. 
The police have dereks phone and know everything about jack. Jack is in some shit, he had to report to the station due to being aggressive woth police and refusing arrest. Jack now has to report to the station 3 days a week for a month before his court hearing.. what do you think is going to happen?"

First allow me to say what I do right because people start just assuming all sorts of things about my life when I say what I like lol:  

*Im average looking, average body, good hygiene (not a given for the stereotype of what I like)

*i stay physically active playing basketball

*I dress like an average guy 

*I enjoy cooking Korean and American food because I take pride in my mixed heritage

*I know how to clean and keep a clean apartment

*im studying in field with solid job prospects and decent money 


I say all this because whenever I say what I like people give me a wide berth and people tend to think I’m not worth their time and assume the above is not true.

Here’s where it goes TERRIBLY WRONG WITH GIRLS IVE TALKED TO:

* I like using Xbox to talk to my friends who I moved away from ( I don’t play too many games tbh) 

* I watch hella anime 

* I draw anime characters and album art and post it to my other reddit account.  I enjoy seeing people that like my work on reddit.  It makes my day bright! 

*i enjoy Studying Korean and Japanese (I want an international job one day

* I insist on wearing glasses ( weird but a girl told me I looked awful once with them :(  ) 

I like these things partly because I’m shy, people have made fun of me since I was little for this.  I’m just not a loud person and this seems to be something women don’t like in my experience.  I can talk, I’m just a reserved person I can’t really change that lol

I’ve tried finding other things that are more classically manly things but I just am not happy.
I’ve tried lifting weights, getting into cars, being a “sports” guy but I just end up looking fake because I don’t like these things.

How can I both make myself happy but still seem appealing and not a boring person?  
I don’t want to stop doing these things because a GF won’t make me happy, I only I can do that.  But I really like the idea of having someone in my life that’s closer than a male friends. 

Should I change or have I just not yet found the right woman? 

TLDR:  I’m a painfully average person who’s shy and whose hobbies and likes are women repellent lol How can I change but keep myself happy or should I just keep doing me ?"

0,"Chronic Leg Pain // Does anyone know what is wrong with me?? Desperate!. Hi all,
I’ll try to make this as short as possible. About 2 years ago I got an office job when I was 19. After about 3 weeks I started having a pain in the back of my legs, directly under my buttocks. The pain was in both legs, and felt like a stabbing. A few weeks go by and the pain takes over my lower back near my SI joints.
Wanted help, I went to my doctor. Who sent me to another doctor, who sent me to another doctor, etc.
Since this has started I have different specialists and doctors; general physicians, orthopedics, neurologist, rheumatologist, acupuncturists, chiropractors, physical therapists, pain management and others. A total of 17 different specialists and doctors, and all have told me something different; SI joint disfunction, Piriformis Syndrome, bursitis, sciatica, tight hamstrings and more. 
I have been sent for 5 MRIs and 3 x-rays which all show nothing. I have had 5 steroid injections and facet blocks in my back to stop the pain, but those don’t work anymore either. 
My pain has become unbearable. I have been living off of prescribed pain killers for almost 19 months. I can no longer drive, and I am posting this today as it is hard to walk now. Sitting and driving hurt the most, in the same spot originating in my back and directly under my buttocks. It reaches into my hips, making them feel inflamed and sore as if someone has been hitting me with a baseball bat. 
I am 21 years old and no doctor has been able to tell me what is happening, and I am slowly running out of hope. Please, if anyone has any information that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you."

0,"My [20F] boyfriend [21M] wants to leave to model when I’m moving across the world for him.. so, l have been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years now, most of which has been long distance since l live in Canada and he lives in England. I bought a one-way plane ticket as I was planning to move to England this Summer. He just got the opportunity of a lifetime to travel around the world to places including Asia, Milan, and Paris. I have a UK passport, so l can work in the UK no issue. However, if l were to travel around the world with him, l would have no source of income while l blow through my money on hotels, plane tickets, etc. Basically, l feel really left behind as l am leaving my entire life behind to move to England for him. But, it’s a tricky situation as l know if l was offered, l would take the opportunities he has been given. It’s definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity and because we are so young, it is doable. I’m just struggling in feeling like a “follower” and that l have no purpose anymore. Any advice or pros about the situation would be helpful! Thanks!"
0,McDonald’s workers of the early 2000’s.

We became friends and have been pretty close the past 2 years. He’s been over my house quite a few times and we have “sleepovers “ often. A few weeks ago I randomly decided to go through his twitter follows to see if he followed any good meme pages. What I found was an UNGODLY amount of SW’s who all happened to have albinism. I have albinism and I thought it was weird and long story short he admitted to having an “albino fetish” . That makes me SUPER uncomfortable and now I feel weird around him.

0,"Today I finally tied my shoes again after my injury. Should I rejoice? Or contemplate???. 
Hi Reddit, This is a long one so i apologize ahead of time. I am kinda in tears rn and can only type with one hand so sorry for the mistakes and grammar errors. So I don’t really want to explain how it happened, because it still gives me nightmares, but nine months ago I had an accident and my right hand (dominant hand) was cut and the laceration caused by it cut my ulnar nerve 100% and my median 70%. It’s hard to talk about but I was rushed to the hospital, bleeding out, asking the guy across from me “am I going to die”? At this Point I can’t tell you how much blood I lost but it was a lot. Anyways he says to me “just calm down because anxiety and your heart racing can pump blood faster in a situation like this”. He tried to call me down by asking me questions and complimenting my tattoo. So I get to the hospital and I’m surrounded by everybody. It feels like everybody in the hospital was surrounding me. So they stitch it up(poorly I might add) but I was done bleeding. Fast forward to seeing my doctor performing surgery on me told me I might never be able to use my hand again 100%. Blunt, but honest which I can respect. So the day I went to the hospital they were checking beforehand to see if I had adequate blood flow to keep my hand. Monitors the whole ordeal. My fiancée heart was pounding and so was mine. But alas they said it was sufficient enough to go through surgery. I was in the operating room for six hours before I woke up on a bed getting attentive care in the post op. The nurse said hi in an angelic voice and the first thing(even though I was certain) was to ask if I still had my hand. I did and I was ecstatic, because I had some hope. After all of that I was prescribed Oxy to deal with the shocks from nerve damage. If you haven’t experienced it it feels like somebody put a taser right on my wrist. I would scream in agony it was horrible. I was in a cast and then in time in a splint which I was in for four months until I took it off. My fingers were bound by straps in a position that locked them in an backwards L shape. I started therapy to try to loosen them up and help my dexterity and mobility in my fingers because they were stuck in the same position for months. Today was a little step that made me cry I finally got the mobility to use my right hand to tie my shoe lace. That is all and off my chest, I’m lucky to be able to even due a minor mistake. Thank you"

0,"What is the purpose of life?. What is the purpose of life?

Very vague question that I am pretty sure most everyone has asked a time or two in their life. Seriously though, what is the point? We have had thousands of years to figure out what we are supposed to be doing, yet, all we have to show are some electronic devices we shove our faces into every day, lights that are convenient, knowledge we only know as truth, some nifty transportation devices, medicines, countless theories on everything under the sun, weapons that can kill one person instantaneously,  weapons that can kill millions instantly, and a million other things we use just to make our lives a little easier... a little less... hard. But why? We act like we wake up every day trying to conquer the world( I mean, we do say that right?) but can we? Do we “conquer the world”? We still have heartaches and darkness that encloses us into a box we don’t want another soul to look upon. So how has anything we done improved the human condition? Does it need improving? And if it does is there ever a point that the condition is improved? If all of humanity was seen as one person, how would you describe that person? You start with the birth, the realization that he is “alive”, and then what? What’s next for that person? If we look at it from our point of view, well, the person plays as a kid, learns some in school, works till they’re  almost dead, plays some more (maybe), then, they’re done. So, is that how we are supposed to be? Or do we carry on? Do we just continue trying to “make things better”?... but what is”better”? If a lion, let’s say, were to become “alive” like a human, to be “aware”, do you think that lion would simply just stop being a lion, or would he become... something else? Would he wonder why he was going to kill that antelope that was just running a minute ago, just to feed his body? Would he try and make it so he never had to go kill an antelope again and find “better things to do”? How would the lion deal with the human? Will the lion still be a lion? At what point would he understand, that he’s only a lion?"

0,"Virginia-Trying to figure out how likely my child’s father will get supervised visitation. Going to court next month and I have many reasons to be terrified of my 2 month old infant to be alone with him.. So my child’s father and I (we’re married, but separated) go back to court next month. We went in feb and I got full custody and he got reasonable visitation but since the baby is so young the judge appointed a guardian ad litem and is having us come back for a final decision. He lost his first two kids from a previous marriage to social services and they got adopted out. He used to have a cocaine addiction, still and always has used marijuana (I’m not saying marijuana is horrible I’m just stating all the facts), has used crack cocaine and other things. He also has threatened to take the baby from me and I’d never see her again, one of the main reasons I left him. He abandoned his house 5 mins from where me and her are staying and moved back in with his mother, step father, 4 siblings, grandma, and one of his siblings pregnant girlfriend. He’s lied to me about so many things and along with his past and things he’s said and done I don’t feel like I can trust him alone with her and i DEFINITELY don’t trust her without me at the house he’s staying with. Most the people have mental issues, especially his mother, she’s on mental disability and I have screenshots of her saying she prayed for me to miscarry my first child that I actually did miscarry and lying on me and my husband, and the house is infested with roaches and not kept up well. I’ve never kept my daughter from him, when he lived near us I would let him take her to his house despite how young she is because he constantly threatened to get me in legal trouble if I didn’t obey and would manipulate me into believing if I didn’t give him what he wanted social services would get involve and she could get taken. Our relationship has always been toxic and I have a misdemeanor of contempt thanks to him and his brothers provoking me and pressing an assault charge on me for telling them not to touch me or I’d kill them. It was two separate charges, that both got dropped, but because I was on probation for the first one when the second occurred I got arrested and thrown in jail while pregnant for probation violation and out of all of that only got the misdemeanor of contempt. I also had a suicide attempt a year ago after I lost my first child and was dealing with his manipulative narcissistic garbage. I know I’ve made mistakes too but everything wrong I ever did occurred during our relationship and I accredit it to his influence and the stress he put on me. I was perfectly fine before him and I’ve been fine after him other than the stress he continues to cause. I love my baby more than anything and she’s truly made me a better person and I’ve taken care of her since day one and have been told I’m great at it and a natural, even by her father. He also told me he’s been suicidal and took the car that was in my name and lied about making payments and it repossessed. I’m just trying to see if anyone has been through something similar or knows if this is worthy of getting supervised visitation on his part."

If this rate is even correct, the virus is going to kill ~92M people over the course of sometime. [58M](https://www.indexmundi.com/world/death_rate.html) people already die every year. 

~92M is only twice of total deaths per year. There is 7.7 billion people in the world. 92M is small compared to the world’s population.

This is my first ever post to Reddit so apologies for the title of my post lol.
I've started writing a fantasy/reality story about revenge that then basically becomes a story about the uprising of a villain.
I've made some progress with it, written a few chapter drafts (not in chronological order) and the people I've shown it to in real life have given me great feedback however, I'm trying to find people willing to read it whom will be able to give me an honest non biased opinion.
It's difficult to find as I don't know where to start and I'm excited to write my story so I'm accepting of constructive criticism!
If anyone could offer me any advice I'd be very appreciative of it.
Also my story will involve a lot of fighting, action and sex, so it's definitely not for kids.
The villain is also based off my own personal life so she is also a woman lol.

Thank you for reading my post"

Then overtime, he sold out. He makes another channel and changes the first one to ""Planet Dolan"", uses clickbait titles with suggestive pictures, hires narrators cause his lazy just wants free money, and repeats videos using slightly different titles.

Does anyone have suggestions of things I can do to make myself less bored and make the time go quicker ?

0,"Let’s play. Does “let’s play” mean flirting?

I (M32) recently moved to a town where an old college friend (F32) lives. She found out I moved there through Facebook and reconnected suggesting we hangout. 

A bit of context, is that I asked her on a date on college when she, unbeknownst to me, was dating someone. Thereby she turned it down, by saying “you know I am dating so and so..”

Fast forward all these years and we are both in the same city.

So, our initial meeting was frankly nothing short of sparks flying, although I remain unfazed and guarded.  In my mind she was flirting heavily, baby doe eyes, touching me, and laughing. She seemed to not want to leave.

Afterwards she suggested we hangout again when I return (my work keeps me traveling).

So after a couple weeks I reinitiated contacted and suggest we hangout. She said she was thinking about me when I made this contact.

In the context of us arranging general plans she says, she is mostly free next week so “let’s play”. Now that term took me by surprise. I’ve never heard that term used. 

Is she attracted? Maybe I am projecting my wishes on the situation. 


Just a bit guarded from my being turned down by her in the past. But of course would like this to work out.

tl;DR! Woman who reconnected after college, and seems to show signs of flirting says, “let’s play” in regards to us hanging out. 

Does this woman show signs of attraction?"

0,"How to make the first move on a girl?. Now that title is quite misleading in terms of the type of answers I’m after, see immediately after reading that title most of you (if any of you) see this, would assume that I’m the type of idk teen? (I’m 18 so yeh teen) that doesn’t go out much and has never had any kind of romantic or sexual interaction with a girl, which I wanna make clear isn’t the case, but I can see how anyone reading this would see that as exactly the case and I’m trying to convince you that I’m the opposite. So without droning on anymore, I have recently ended things with my girlfriend of two years, we started seeing each other in secondary school and continued through most of college (not the American type of college may I add, I’m from England incase it’s not clear) but we ended on good terms and still see each other almost each weekend as what she labels us as (best friends) which to me is quite demeaning on what I think of it as, but the point I’m trying to make is that she is very popular and one could also say attractive or fit. Now where I’m from that makes her an easy target for all the fuck boys ( again American term for fuck boy I believe is similar to a ‘Stud/ a guy named chad’ ) and basically she bets a lot of attention and I don’t. I made the choice of not ditching my friends for my girlfriend but I decided to go to a more distant college, because in England if you didn’t kno we have these things called sixthform and essentially it’s like staying at your secondary school for another two years accept you’re technically in ‘college’. But I didn’t wanna do that so I went to a college a bit further way that wasn’t a ‘sixthform’ as you can tell I like typing a lot, but again without droning on I essentially ditched my friends and since breaking up with the only person that showed interest in me I am now left without many, is not any friends that I can see often and she gets a lot of attention almost all the time but also goes out a lot more than she used to with me, so I’ve decided today is the day I want to start talking to other girls, I wanna attempt at idk At least finding someone to take my attention off of my ex and start finding the confidence to talk to another girls because I have lost that since being with just one person for two years (which I get isn’t that long compared to others)  but I’m generally a shy person and my original thoughts while typing this is to go straight to Instagram after I post this to accept some requests from girls that tried to follow me ages ago and just send a dm and hope for the best, but I’m wondering if since only joining reddit a day ago, that some of you might have any better advice for me."

We start to tell her that, this park, is in fact, free to the public to use, and people are not restricted to coming here. I guess she wasn't having any of that.

So I thought going in that I was going to see that scene but there was something in me that was thinking there is no such scene. 

Anyway we watched it the whole way through and the scene never came. I burst into tears because these weird feelings started to creep up. 

The last time I had watched this film was with my grandfather when I was about 8/9. 
The scene I thought I remembered had a penis and black slacks ( which my grandfather always wore ). 

As a young age I masterbated and sometimes in the same room as him (with a cushion between us). 
I honestly just don’t know what to feel. I’m at a complete loss. I loved my grandfather (he died about ten years ago) and don’t know why I have these feelings that something happened because if they didn’t I feel horrible for even thinking it.

I graduated with a MA in Geography from University of Delaware back in 2018. I had intended on going for a PhD, but for various reasons got sidetracked during my 3rd semester and never applied.

My first job post-graduation was in electrical engineering. This was a six month internship which was lucrative, but I found the work not to my interest. Furthermore, all the employees seemed absolutely miserable in their personal lives due to the job.

I next worked in municipal management for a 6 months in Prince George’s County, but was fired for “inadequate work performance”. AKA, my boss waited 3 months to review a project I was assigned that I had no experience in, and had little time to complete because in that time I had 1) increased tourism by 800% 2) won an international award for my business development 3) managed and renegotiated our trash collection agency because we received on average 100 complaints a month for missed collection 4) teach myself Spanish so that I could be the “carrot” to illegal businesses operating in town before the actual authorities went after them 5) lead a communications effort in town that literally never existed and has since dropped 6) produced and managed the only programs my department produced ... meanwhile the Development Director took 8 hour lunch breaks and my boss took several vacations.

Anyway. After that I (27 M) moved back in with my retired parents in rural Pennsylvania, which I very much appreciate. I struggled to find a meaningful, and even not meaningful, job until last week. In that time, I received a rejection notice from University of Nevada due to lack of funding and an acceptance without funding until “maybe Spring” from University of Hawaii.

My question is, should I take the PhD position at Hawaii? I am not sure if I should risk it for the biscuit and hopefully secure funding through a TAship or some other source in Spring. The program is great and specializes in what I want to do for research/career, but again, it is currently unfunded. Or should I pray that my new exciting career in night shift warehouse work leads to something better?"

ie: Biden says to NBC exec, Hey it's in your interest also to see that I beat Bernie.  I'd like to run $20 million in ads, but you can throw $10 million of that back to me through donations to a superpac. Unless you like paying high taxes of course, then don't help me and let Bernie win."

0,"What can a person do to get rid of their preconceptions towards sex and be more inclusive?. In my field of work (software development) I constantly run into situations where people act discriminatorily or with prejudice towards e.g. women. Due to prejudice, women in IT seem to generally have a harder time than men at work and in their careers. Most of the women programmers I have met have had cases where they have felt oppressed at work due to their sex.

Often people might unknowingly say something rude related to another persons sex or ethnicity.

Im building a company, and I want my company to be diverse and inclusive. I think it can be a strength for my company if all genders and minorities feel welcome and it feels like the right thing to do.

What can a single person, or a whole organisation, consciously do to be more inclusive? What are things you can teach to a person to help them get rid of preconceptions they might not knowingly have?"

Been married F37 for 20 years...working on separation to divorce.  Husband 41 has a horrible temper.  In public he is a saint.  Everyone loves him.  I dated him because he seemed “safe”.  Quiet, book smart...not a player.  Over the years his “quiet” had translated into secrecy.  His temper showed itself..leaving me baffled.  Holes in the walls, taking a knife to all of the clothes I have bought him, hammer to his watches, phones thrown aimed at my face, leaving a hole in the door, screaming, yelling, physical things I don’t want to speak of, verbal abuse...but what has been the most constant, is the yelling.  We have children...that I know hear him when he loses control.  He denies that they, or our neighbors can hear him screaming. It’s embarrassing and scary.  It’s not always over anything big, or important...tonight it was about spatulas....I get angry sometimes, but I do not understand yelling and screaming. Rational behavior and conversation is my way of solving an issue.  I want to problem solve....his way is completely ignoring absolutely everything or screaming.  How normal is yelling for a man?

0,"Interracial marriage. My parents grew up in the south (US) and attended a segregated high school. I never saw them demonstrate any racism until I discovered they are strongly opposed to interracial marriage. They have lived all over the country over the years, and my father has traveled the world, yet they hd this ingrained belief that interracial marriage is wrong (specifically black/white marriage). They are now in their 70s and still feel this way. When asked why, they just point to their upbringing and state that they believe most others feel similarly and likely even look down on interracial couples. My question is - in the absence of any other racist ideology, do you think being opposed to interracial marriage is racist?

I believe it is - but my parents balk and get extremely offended when I characterize their ideology as racist. So who is right? (Throwaway account, as I do not want this connected to my main.)"

A year ago my dad and brother both needed somewhere to stay my dad because of his divorce from stepmom, brother because of his drug problem had apparently not been going to work and got fired. My dad has heart problems which during this time put him in the hospital several times. My grandma told me i act like his wife because I cooked for him ,kept reminding him to use his fsa for hospital bills ( he legit has $1000 fsa but choose to use credit cards wtf), i would get mad at him when he drinks bc he only does when he has friends around and because his heart condition he is cautioned not to, i also hate being around him when he has multiple women coming around as cheating on my stepmom for the past 20 years has been a problem he would literally bring gfs around me and brother and makes us lie to our stepmom. My brother since losing his job last year has been living with me, he rarley cooks, sleeps all day but manages to eat so much food when hes up, when im home on weekends he often takes my car without permission and i ask him where he is when he doesnt come home, he asks me for $20 everysingle saturday around 11pm. My family has told me i act like his gf because i ask where he is alot, i complain to him about not doing anything around the house and abour getting a job. I got some new clothes recently and asked brother if he noticed my new shoes( i usually wear the same work shoes) and he said no hes not my man. I was jusy sort of asking for a compliment since he sees my wear the same work shoes i though maybe he noticed as my coworkers noticed wasnt that big of deal to me but maybe it was inappropriate to ask about the shoes?

And also for like two weeks out each month in July August September she just plain didn’t text me or call me. And we started to talk again November time. And then recently she texted me a pic of her in a modest swimsuit but still showing on the side.(she was going swimming) before that we were texting each other photos of our dogs and what we were doing. What do I do? I also said cute to her swimsuit and she just plain said “no”. Did I mess it up or how can I fix it. 

We are both quirky and weird but I am not social and she is. And she has a sharpie mark on her thigh that says DSP, what does that mean, I also know she has friends who drink and smoke I highly doubt she does it.

0,"Never had a contract with this person. Now he is harassing me and my family.. Hello everyone. I have been recommended to come here as my brother told me that you guys give tips and advice on certain matters. 

Names are fake to protect the identity of the people involved.

Around summer 2019 I had a friend (Rich) who was helping me try to find some jobs from home as in a creative kind of job like video editing. He gave me contact info to a guy named (Shane). Shane was a really nice guy at first, very professional, has a beautiful outlook on life. After shane and I talked for an hour about what i want to do he then approached me for an offer to join his video editing crew for a YouTube channel he was working on. Kind of like watch mojo type videos, your cliche top 10 stuff. I was very thrilled about this opportunity. At the time I just moved back in with family after graduating college and the breakup of my ex girlfriend, I needed something to distract me and this was perfect. You see, I am a very quick learner and have been around adobe premier since 2004. So Shane was more than willing to offer to pay me money upfront for some videos. So this is when we start to get to the whole point of this ordeal. I did the videos for Shane, as time went on he got passive aggressive because I technically didn’t do it in the “style” like his crew did. But in reality it looked just like the same style, I had friends tell me it looks the same. So a a few months later (october); Shane then calls me up and tells me “so I don’t think the top 10 videos you are making are working out so what I am going to have you do is, mashup videos on Instagram”, I was a bit upset don’t get me wrong because I technically got de-promoted in a sense, I went from making 5-6 min vids to 1 min. So I replied with “that’s fine, no problem at all” I did the mashup videos like he said, gave him what he needed and he seemed happy about it. A month goes by and I approach him with letting me try the top 10 vids, he said that he would give me another chance. So I did it again and he was not satisfied once again, at this point I am irritated, I am literally doing what he wants me to do and I would spend 4-6 hours working on them giving it my all and effort. He then does not text me for 2 months. At that point during that time, I just started a job as a sales coordinator at a hotel which was awesome. Out of nowhere he texts me on New Year’s Eve asking me to do a job in which i was glad to do because I felt as if I owed him and I had no problem doing it. The job was simple get YouTube channels with 1k subs or less and get there email etc. So I spend about 4-5 hours researching my butt off and got around 300-500 channels. I send him the files and what do you know? You guessed it. HE WAS NOT HAPPY ONCE AGAIN. So then after that a week later he texts me and wants thumbnails for his channel, I said yes I would be glad to do it. Welp, what happened was my computer at home literally went out on me and during that time and still currently I am stacked with all of these bills and have no way of buying one. I tell him what happened, he was not pleased with what I said, he then stated “I am the best most patient boss you will ever have, but I think we are done here, I want the full payment that I loaned you back by next week”, by then I just ignored it. Because I did the work he asked me to do for him, part of me told myself to pay him back, but I just thought this was really screwed up and I didn’t know what to do. He texted me 3 weeks after, asking for the money and I said to him that I would try to pay some back but it would take awhile as I got a rent, insurance and the irs (this is so I could avoid some conflict. Yes I know I need to be more stern), He then replies “bullshit, you need to pay me now”. 
As he said that, that is when I started to really let my anger get the best of me as I have been very patient with him and the way he has treated me. I pretty much go off and tell him that he needs to be more respectful etc etc, yes I did swear a lot and went off on him (my mistake). He then proceeds to tell me that I am a thief and I better “watch out” because he will “call my parents, states he has every text message and that (me) i am a nobody and I have nothing, he then also stated he makes a 6 figure salary and that I could never amount to his level. It got ridiculous because not only did I felt insulted I was offended at the fact he was threatening my family and I. My parents are not involved at all they have no part of this ordeal and i did give my parents money for rent that (Shane) sent me. He then states “I will call the cops and bring my lawyer as well if you do not give me a payment”. At that point I felt a bit frightened and did not know what to do. I was advised by family and friends to ignore him and to move on. Well.... that does not work. He has tried calling, emailing etc, I feel harassed at this point. I have anxiety because of this. He does live about 21 hours away from me. But.. this was the breaking point, this is what led to come here. I woke up (I work graveyard) went to my parents house (they were asleep) but saw my brother, he then proceeded to tell that there was a letter or something that was sent by ups or something as they had to take whatever there was back because the person did not knock on the door. He shows me what ups or fedex (sorry I don’t remember carrier, I was a bit heated and forgot) left and it had a note saying to pick it up at the there store, it had (Shane’s) name as well mine saying “to the parents of James”. Yes I was fuming in anger, this guy does not stop, my brother advises me to ignore it and not get the letter and that my parents told him to tell me that. My brother said even if he tried to take me to small claims he would pay more money to take me to court and buy a plane ticket etc. So. 

That is where it ends here. I need advice guys. I am sorry for the long long story. But I needed to give everything significant that happened. I need your help. What should I do?

0,"Does Paracetamol cause itching in Chicken pox?. I was recently diagnosed with chicken pox 3 days ago , and for the past 2 days my entire body has been itching unbearably.. then I realised that I’ve been consistently taking 2 paracetamol tablets every 6 hours to cope with the fever.
 I Would usually have 2 pills at 6am and go back to sleep, wake up at 12pm and have another 2 pills.

This morning, however, I didn’t take any pills at 12pm, and for the past few hours, the itching seems to have toned down exponentially. Could my blisters just be naturally healing, or does paracetamol really trigger an itch in my whole body?

Yesterday I came down with a 24-hour bug and proceeded to vomit every 20-30 minutes from about 2pm to 3am.

But, 

When I was upset I went outside and let out my frustration. I live in (Semi rural? Let’s just say most people have 5+ acres where I live, and it’s semi country side) Australia. So, we have an abundance of wild magpies and other birds that have made their homes in my backyard. This day I was particularly upset and was crying outside. I noticed a magpie and it’s baby watching me. I remember thinking, “do they know I’m upset? Surely not.” So I kept my little tantrum up to let off steam. The whole time I noticed the magpie watching me - the baby too. It wasn’t scared or did it seem like it was afraid, it seemed genuinely curious. Almost as though it understood that I was upset. It watched with its head turned (suppose its because their eyes are on the side of its head lol) and just on looked. It seemed so genuinely curious - I just knew it knew I was upset. I felt like it wanted to know why? It was so peculiar to see another animal so genuinely concerned? I don’t know, Probably not. But it seemed so interested in my behaviour. I haven’t really thought about it much until now. However, whenever I go outside I see the mother and it’s baby, and it definitely recognises me. I just know it. Crazy thought, but I wonder if it thinks “it’s her. The one that was upset.” I also wonder if it was trying to comprehend what I was being upset about - obviously two completely different environments and two completely different complex emotional standards. But still. I knew that day that, that magpie could see I was upset and was genuinely curious towards me. 

P.s I know crows and magpies have a conscious thinking mind, and are also very intelligent - I wish we knew more about them."

We use imagination in the study of history as we portray in our minds the characteristic of individuals or the nature of events. We even try to address the gaps by using imagination as an aid to re-create history without having to lose sight of reality as it was."

Sarah has also a best friend called lea, Sarah told me numerous times that lea is her best friend and when ive asked am i not her best friend? She said we both are..

because Sarah and I are neighbors.

Sarah works at a military office and lea told me Sarah offered to get her new notebooks, pencils, pens whatever she needs before she gets back to uní.

Sarah never offered such thing for me, i was shocked bc all lea had to say was “I’ll use my time here to get school supplies” and Sarah offered to help her out and said don’t buy anything i got you.

Im deeply offended Sarah never offered such thing for me, we meet all the time, she knows im a student as well and she’s never brought me a lousy notebook.

Drifting in Mario Kart gives you a short speed boost. In Mario Kart DS, players found that they can continually chain short drifts together—in some stages, you can do so for the entire race. Eventually, as more players were able to do it, snaking became the normal way to play certain stages.

Here’s the background:  My brothers ex-fiancé has mental illness.  Borderline Personality Disorder to be exact.  They have two children together and they broke up about a year ago but have remained friends and have co-parented their children somewhat amicably.  Until December when she stopped allowing him to see them.  This day she had texted that she was so high on cocaine that she wasn’t being a good mother.  He went over to help her, he took the kids out of the house for several hours and when he returned she had done more cocaine and was now drunk.  He made the kids dinner and put them to bed.  She asked to speak to him in private and he complied.  He slept in his 4 year olds room.  When he woke up he left at about 6 am.  At 9 am she texted him accusing him of sexual assault.  She has a track record of accusing many other men of this.  She has not allowed him to see the children since then saying that she needed some time to “heal” and continuously moving dates that he could have the kids so that now it has been three months.  When I spoke to him he told me some very concerning things about injuries requiring trips to the hospital, but she doesn’t believe in taking the kids to Dr’s.  For instance she super glued a chin laceration at home when a child needed stitches.  He is getting so many concerned messages from the things she is posting on Facebook.  She has left drugs out within reach of the kids.  We can called CPS but so far have gotten no results.  After I call for a well check we both received emails with threats of retaliation.  One day later his neighbor texted him that she was moving out of her house with no notice.  She stated she was staying in Nevada but then the next day began posting she was now a resident of Southern California.  We called CPS the minute the neighbor said they were moving but no one to the house until a day later and now of course they are gone.  We have contacted two lawyers but now that she is out of state we don’t know what else we can do.  They do not have a custody agreement.  If we can find her via private investigator what should we do?  Any help would be so greatly appreciated."

0,"If you had the chance to ""download"" a dream, would you want to?. So im just asking because I've been having the strangest, weirdest and most randomest dreams, For the past few years pretty much everyday, it's not like they really affect me in my daily life, but they do make me think. If I'm a good or bad person, they can really mess with my mind so much so I get into a feeling of derealization.

I sadly, (like most of us) forget them when I try to remember them, but others will stay with me forever. May it be a nightmare, happy dream, memory, wet dream or just some random story.

There are plenty of dreams I can remember and could even draw or write but they are mostly ""fractured"" and when I do try remembering them I get a feeling of Déjà vu or even get the weirdest headaches, paranoia seems kick in and I really don't understand why, is it normal or is there actually something wrong with me.

So all I'm saying is if the possibility was there to actually watch your dream as a movie whenever you wanted, how would it affect our subconscious is it healthy, should it be done, can there be side effects?

Just curious and wondering if anyone thinks the same way I do. I have not gone to a therapist/psychologist because I'm afraid of what they will say. It's not like my childhood was perfect but it wasn't bad either, random acts of bullying, depression....

Anyways thanks for reading and be free to say whatever you want."

0,"Billions of years to the evolution of the first “intelligent” life on earth and then multiple civilisations rolling over, dying and re-emerging. Do you think there is intervention?

Elaborating further on the construct in the title, human civilisations have shown over time that we grow, politically, culturally and technologically only to be stifled by a great culling ( basically an end of the civilisations) or progress is stifled or set back by major global events such as wars etc. I have a thought around this. It seems as a pattern that the human race has the capability to grow at an exponential rate, but there’s always something that comes in and poses a set back. Do you thing there is some kind of divine or alien intervention that constantly judges our progress and decides how far they think is safe for us ( or their agenda ) and intervenes when they think apt? Sounds rather plausible."
0,"Breakups. My girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago and it was pretty mutual we had our differences and all but I’m going through something I’ve never been through before and not really sure how to handle it. I’ve got a lot going on in life so my minds constantly running, but when I put my head down on my pillow I find myself dreaming of her and they’re happy dreams for the most part and I get sad to see they’re not real but I think I enjoyed the companionship and not exactly the idea of dating her-don’t her me wrong she was an awesome genuinely sweet person but we had differences. I’m sure she’s off doing her thing and blocked me almost everywhere I believe, but I don’t want to go back to her and tell her what I’m thinking or feeling, is this normal? How do I deal with my subconscious making me feel this way?"

I promise you this, I will be true to you, I will support you, I will be there with you in the good times,and I will comfort you in the tough times, I will appreciate all you do for us, I will grow with you, I will never stop embracing you, I will keep laughing with you and I will try to brush your hair more. 

You have made me the happiest man on the world today by agreeing to share your life with me. I love you for more reasons everyday  and I look forward to waking up with you for the rest of our lives."

0,"How would humanity behave with another slightly primitive intelligent species. A species doesn't suddenly become intelligent overnight, but let's say for example that our planet had a species that had achieved a level of intelligence and sentience beyond the smartest animals but still more primitive and early stages to our own.

How would humanity treat this potentially 'lesser' species that only has to catch up to where we are, living not on another planet as an alien to study as it evolves but as something we can and possibly would directly influence? 

As a whole would humanity just treat them like toddlers, hand holding and guiding? Would bigoted and prejudiced mindsets overwhelmingly spring up against them? Would we step back and have to not influence or interact with them? What sort of unforseen problems might arise?"

0,"3 days to find out my starting date at new job??. So, I joined reddit simply to ask this one specific question without asking people in my personal life. Anyways, so my situation goes like this: I recently had an interview on Thursday, they hired me on the spot. The HR lady and front of house manager initially asked me if I could go in on Saturday to start training but then switched it to today. I didn’t get a time on when she wanted me to go in and start training because I forgot and figured I would ask at orientation the next day (Friday). I did orientation and at the end, the HR lady ends up talking to someone else who is apart of HR about when us front of house people should go in and start training. She comes back into the room and says that the 3 of us were going to receive an email from our managers (the other 2 got hired at one location and I got hired for a separate one) about when we were going to start and what not. Saturday comes around and I hadn’t received an email. I then waited until Sunday morning to call my location I was hired for and explained the situation. She said that she was going to call the HR lady to hired me and was going to call me back. She never did. So I ended up emailing the HR lady on Sunday around 3/3:30 in the afternoon about what she would like me to do, if she wanted me to still go in today and start training and she didn’t respond until a little after 7 this morning. She asked if I could go in tomorrow and I responded about 30 minutes after she emailed me. I still haven’t received a confirmation on anything. Anyways, so my question is does this mean anything...? As in does it mean I’m officially hired or not?"

 1. You only get to pick 3 categories. They can be anything you want as long as its appearance based. 

 2. When you build your man you get 20 points to place into each category. Maximum of 10 points, minimum of 1 point. 

 3. Do not criticize anyone for any category they choose. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. 

And the optional 3rd question. Why did you pick the categories you chose?

0,"My fiancé’s son left a bird behind TV and lied by saying the bird had died.. Hi everyone!
My fiancé bought his 9 year old child a parakeet. 

This morning, the child told me the bird had died and that he had placed him in a bag and had put the bird in the trash. I honestly didn’t ask too many questions since the kid seemed sad. Later in the day I decided to surprise him by taking the kid to get a new bird from the store. On the way back home, the kid asked me ‘what if the other bird didn’t die?’ I didn’t understand his question so I asked him to explain, he repeated ‘what if the bird we had didn’t die and we would have 3 birds now?’ 
I only said, ‘well, I guess we would need a bigger cage’. 

Later in the day, my fiancé got home, we all spent the rest of the day together. To me, the kid seemed perfectly fine and playing video games (the only thing is he didn’t eat much and vomited). To my fiancé, the kid was feeling down. 

In the evening we took the kid back to his mom’s house (since we only have him every other weekend).

About an hour ago, when my fiancé and I were ready to sleep we heard noise in the living room. We went to check and to our surprise, it was the ‘dead bird’ stuck behind the TV on the wall, trying to get out. We immediately rushed to get the bird out and thankfully, she’s now safe. 

My fiancé is furious and said he’ll scold his son and will ground him for what he did. I however, I’m very confused and concerned because a) I’m dissapointed the kid lied to us, and b) I’m concerned that the kid left a scared animal stuck behind the TV and was able to spend his day as usual.

I don’t know what to tell my fiancé. I honestly don’t think his son is a bad kid. But I can’t help but worry about his actions and behavior. Any suggestions, or comments will be greatly appreciate it.

Thank you."

0,"Any Leap day love stories? Can you beat my brothers?. So my little brother (well not so little 6ft 3 and 26yrs old) has always been best friends with the girl next door. They were born months apart and they were this cute little double act growing up. They have all these weird traditions. My brother has always learnt a silly dance rountine for her birthday which he does before handing over her present. Whenever he gets a new pair of rugby boots she “blesses” them by wearing them around the garden to make the wearer safe in battle. At school despite having lots of other friends they would always have Friday lunch together, just them. They even had walkie talkies and used to talk to each other until they fell asleep or they got confiscated.

Her two older sisters and I have been planning their wedding for as long we can remember. Truth be told so have our mums.

Anyway when they reached 16, I and her sisters started taking sneaky pictures of them, when they were off guard and staring amorously at the other. In retrospect I wish we hadn’t done this because what 16 year old wants their families planning their entire lives out for them? Although we do have a bunch of really sweet but incredibly embarrassing photos. Again when I say I regret doing it the practice of unsolicited interfamily paparazzi continued until finally banned by my dad two years ago. Anyway these two awkward best friends continued avoiding romance through school and eventually left for university. Everyone was gutted when they found different boyfriends and girlfriends but life went on.

Every Christmas and summer they would come home and slot right back into being those two goofy little kids who wanted nothing more from life than the company of the other. They got jobs and are now both successful young professionals making their way in the world. About a year ago my brother’s little friend split up with her boyfriend and moved back in with her parents for a bit. My brother started making any excuse to come home and again they started spending every night playing sports, watching movies, taking the dog for long walks or just messing around.

At this point I should mention that the girl next door and her family are British Chinese. Sadly recently like many people of her ethnicity she has had some upsetting trips on British public transport where racist idiots moved away from her fearing catching Coronavirus. She wanted to show my brother how awful people can be so yesterday she turned up at our door mischievously wearing a face mask 😷 and after being hugged by our mum about a thousand times, they set off to catch the tube (underground train)together. They were to be on for a few stops and my brother was instructed to stand separately and watch. Sure enough a minority of people started avoiding her and even changing carriage.

Seeing this happen was too much for my brother and he burst out crying. Seeing him crying at her “experiment” she ripped off her face mask and gave him a kiss to say “i’m ok”. Anyway she kisses him all the time but just on the forehead or cheek and it is normally accompanied by a slap on the bottom or punch in the arm. But yesterday it was a peck on the lips and the peck turned into a snog. They continued kissing for several missed stops and by the time they had left the station my brother had told her that he had always loved her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. God knows how the terrified racists must have viewed these remarkable scenes.

The family grapevine has been in overdrive ever since. I have had to calm my mum down on several occasions.

I’m just so happy that they have finally got together and I think they will make each other happy for the rest of their lives.

Everyone have a lovely day and don’t put off telling your special someone you care about them!

Two times the safe line was called. One time we were hung up on. The other time we were yelled at. A series of emails that resulted from our administration were all dead end. 

One of my friends sent another email to admin on Monday essentially explaining that the situation got more intense. She was given the response, “We’ve already talked to her.” That was it. 

Naturally, that raises the question what are schools expected to do? If we are injured at school, legally all the school nurse can do is give us ice, call our parents, or let us lie down for a while. It’s messed up. So if they can do anything for physical injuries, does that translate to mental injuries as well? 

That raises another question. What can change? Things like the baker act are absolutely terrifying and don’t do much to solve the problems. 

What does everyone else think about this? I feel stuck. I don’t understand why the system is the way it is, but I want to change it."

0,"Pulling away from a S/O. I’m curious on people’s opinions on what it means when a significant other pulls away suddenly and doesn’t want to be touched.

Ex. Say you’re out for a walk and some lunch, your time together has been good but you can tell something is on their mind. So as you stop to sit on a bench you reassuring rub their back as you ask them if everything is ok and they snap back with a “Don’t touch me, I’m not in a touchy-feely mood”.

0,"Why do people care about professional sports?. I couldn’t care any less about sports or any particular team, so it baffles me how fanatical so many people are about it.

I also just find them boring and repetitive, with only very slight variations per game, so for me it’s more a form of torture rather than entertainment.

We have been together for about a year now and things have been good until these past few weeks, They show me affection and they are not toxic or abusive in anyway and everything is well with them, They are happy and they do love me, They do have off days as well but they say they do not want to be left alone or given space etc. But I sometimes feel a different way and can't bring myself to tell them. I honestly do not want to break up with them or lose them and I get so sad and hurt thinking about life with out them.

I’m ready to start saving up to move out and start an independent life (away from parents) with my boyfriend. I want to also include that this was his idea to begin with. I’m starting to feel uncomfortable with how much he still loves going out to these raves and spending the money that he spends on tickets. He goes to school and does not have a job. Pretty much lives on his tuition refund. I’m in a sense getting sick of a boyfriend who “won’t grow up”. Other than this one thing about him, he’s great. He’s dedicated, loving, sweet, supportive and so understanding. I also am questioning myself as to why it even matters that he goes out probably once a month to have fun with his friends.

I want to preface this by saying I am very aware of the fact that a large portion of this sub cannot and do not want to understand that couples with age differences can work and are not automobile “creepy” in any way. I am 8 years older than my boyfriend, and he turns 21 in two months. His parents are having a friend/family birthday party which I’ve been invited to, but I haven’t met his parents yet (we have been together 10 months). I would really prefer to meet his parents ahead of time because this relationship is important to me. I understand how a parent could be concerned with the age difference. I honestly don’t know what has been said about me, and I really would like the opportunity to get to know them ahead of time. I asked him about meeting them about 2 months ago, and he’s said yes but keeps dodging whenever I bring it up. The invitation was sent directly from his parents (they know we’re dating, I was there during a phone call).

0,"As an American, if I contracted COVID-19 would I be required to pay for the necessary quarantine and medical treatment, or would I get billed for all of it?. I feel like US culture tries to ignore sickness as much as possible because of the costs of being sick. People constantly work while sick, especially in the food service industry, people avoid hospitals because they may not have insurance or their deductibles are too high, people even go so far as to call Uber’s rather than emergency services because of the near $10,000 bill associated with an ambulance. 
So I guess maybe I have a couple questions: are medical services for the novel coronavirus free in the US? how much worse is this outbreak going to be because of the cost of being sick and the culture around it? I just can’t see many Americans self reporting a possible infection due to the possibility of a massive bill, missing pay for two weeks, and getting fired."

0,"Question for those with/without photographic memory. I am curious because I have absolutely NO photographic memory: What’s it like? What do you see? How vivid are they? Could you hear sounds with it? 

This is my one and ONLY experience with it:
Once, I was up all night and around 3:00, I got really tired and drifted to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later and could see my room around me as if I was awake. The details of my bed and dresser were exact and it was incredible. I realized that my eyes were shut very quickly and began cramming them closed to keep experiencing it but within 30 seconds, like once I realized my eyes were shut and I was still seeing, I saw the picture fading before my eyes before all I saw was the void that I always do. It was so exciting and amazing. This happened a few months ago and It got me thinking about this again. 

My lack of photographic memory does not harm my ability to do well in school. When I remember something It doesn’t ever involve seeing it, it kind of just comes to me when I need it to, just like the words I’m typing on this post. For example, I recently got a 97% on a calculus test. I developed what one could call a small routine and something I learned was if I don’t review for a test, I don’t do well—this applies to easy and hard tests alike. It’s weird, I actually found a music test harder than a calculus test because of this, like the difficulty of a test is based on how much time I put in to recital vs a challenging concept. The concept is a piece of cake no matter what, but remembering how to do it a few days later is not... I forget how to do everything, no matter how easy it is. It will take me a fraction of time to figure out how to do it,but within a week I may as well have never learned it unless I force it into long term memory by reviewing (just like everyone). I learn mostly through my own practice and through a teachers lecture—notes barely help at all unless to note a formula, which is the only thing I need for physics questions and math questions alike. Physics only gets hard when I ovethink it. Thought it would be worth considering because it might be a completely different way of thinking vs people who utilize photographic memory to do school. I find coding to be really easy, but the vocab associated with it to be harder unless I use it myself, then it’s easy. Essentially, It takes me 0 time to understand something but if I don’t spend several days reviewing material, it’s gone. I imagine my short term memory just only stores stuff into long term memory if it is DRILLED.

In vocabulary, I didn’t struggle very much. I could just study for the test an hour beforehand and usually ace it since I’m MUCH better at understanding something than memorizing it. I have to understand it to truly memorize it or have a strong emotion associated with it or some other random factors. I’m not very good with names until they have been drilled into me. I couldn’t describe a face very well either, but I can point out distinct details if I put effort into memorizing a face. I couldn’t tell you what I ate for dinner last night, nor could I tell you the color of my best friends eyes—I could make a guess though and probably be right. In my freshman year of high school, I had to memorize over 300 words and recite it with each word being worth x points. It didn’t go well even with studying. Got nervous and couldn’t focus on recalling memories and later redid it. I think I remember stuff by bridging it to other things, like I could tell you what the second line of the poem was after recalling the first line. I still remember the first few lines of the poem today, in pieces, just by writing this post, around 4-5 years later. 

When I have a blood rush to my head after standing up, whatever you call that term, I do see stuff for a second, but not in my control. I usually see what could be resembled as deep crystal blues, like a deep blue sapphire that emits light over a black void and other things like that.
What I normally see when my eyes are shut is just light hitting my eyelids, aka black void usually or a shifting of the colors red and black and sometimes others depending on what the light of the room is. 
I have sleeping problems and always have. At night, everything changes, but only if I want it to. Sometimes ill be awake and notice I’m shifting into a dream and can dream while awake for a split second before falling asleep entirely. Recently I discovered that when Im trying to go to sleep, I can just pay attention to what object I’m looking at when my eyes are closed and I can eventually pick up on something, such as a point source of a circular dim light trying to draw something but quickly being consumed by darkness before it can get anywhere—its actually beautiful to observe and I fall asleep much quicker doing this. Also, I don’t dream very often. I am a productive person with no trauma. I love science. I’m HORRIBLE at directions, like the worst that I know. I can name the street names that I drive down to get to my house after a long time and it takes me about the same time to get the path down. I drive a lot for work all over cities. Freeway is easier for me since there are exits and I can memorize a path from a freeway exit. I don’t think I have bad memory considering I’ve had people ask if I have it before since I do so well on tests that I study for. 
I also have really bad ADHD


TLDR: My lack of photographic memory hasn’t hurt me in any ways besides navigation and I have my own ways of learning that work pretty well, I can take advantage of the lack of photographic memory to sleep and I don’t dream very often—sometimes months without a dream, but sometimes a week with 3. What’s your experience with photographic memory whether you have it or not. What’s it like for you? Do you have a method of initiating it? How do you handle school in terms of time to understand something and time to truly memorize that understanding for future use?"

0,"legal help w/ non-traffic citation. hi, i’m 17m getting charged with harassment in pennsylvania as a non-traffic citation because my father physically abused me and i had marks and i hit him back in self defense and he took my phone and my mother refused to call the police so i drove to work and asked my manager if i should call the police and he saw the marks on my arm and said yes, so we did, i spoke with the police and then ended up just going home and avoiding my father, after he too spoke with the police. i didn’t want to go to court against him and the police asked me if i wanted to and i said no. apparently under pa law, someone had to be charged for the interaction and it was me because “physical discipline is legal towards minors” or something along the lines of that. it was not discipline if i was dragged across the carpet and had marks all over me. how do i fight this ?? pa police are stupid and last time he abused me they said it was just discipline as well, i didn’t fight back that time or ever before this."

0,"Promised a co-worker a cut of my bonus for completing a job, now he won’t shut up about it.. I never post on here but this has been getting on my last nerve. I was promised a bonus if I completed a construction job on time, from the owner of the company I work for. The second day on the job my helper asked if I would be giving him any of my bonus. Now a little bit about my coworker, he used to be on drugs really bad he genuinely scares me sometimes done a lot of time in jail and has a lot of kids and one of his kids has cancer. He goes to the clinic like weekly and they give him some kinda medicine to help with his old addictions, he will not stop talking when he is on this medication. He also sells these medications, yes even at work. All in all the guy is an okay guy, he just creeps me out because of his past and who he is when he’s on these medications. 

So like I said second day he asks if I would give him some of my bonus. And because of his kid with cancer I said yes and because I have a hard time telling some people no. So we finish the job and still no bonus, my boss hasn’t been paid for the job yet. But my co worker ever single week since the job ended (probably two months ago) 
has texted me asking about this bonus. Every Single Week ... I’ve told him countless times I will text you when I get the bonus stop asking. But still the next week I get a text about this bonus. It’s driving me crazy, because to me it’s so disgusting and disrespectful what he is doing. So I’m just looking for some advice as to what you would do if you were in my shoes. Thank you."

One of those being my inability to connect to the books. Reading has never been my hobby and I've tried to make it one in the recent times because of my need to get better at English literature to clear out the upcoming entrance exams. So I took up the initiative of reading a novel each week last year. It has been a fun ride thus far, what with all the exciting stories, thrillers, sci-fi, romance genres I've had the privilege of reading. But one thing that has been troubling me since the day one is my inability to truly connect to the content or the characters of whichever book I read. 
I firmly believe that if you are not on the verge of almost crying or really happy according to the story, you're not truly realising or living the art. I feel like I'm betraying this beautiful art that reading is. It's almost like watching a three hour long movie and forgetting everything about it once and for all as soon as you leave the movie hall.

0,"Qué debería hacer? Hay una mujer transgénero y toma la idea equivocada. ¿Qué hago?. Quiero afirmar que no tengo nada en contra de la comunidad LGTB
Bueno, ayer estaba en coro como un día cualquiera, y en medio del ensayo, como siempre fue, nuestra directora(la llamaré vero para ocultar su privacidad) como siempre ha dicho mencionó al grupo de personas de la nota de contraalto como ""chicas"".
Ante esto una de las mujeres que se considera hombre(lo llamaremos kei), le dijo a vero que trate de usar ""chiques"" o ""les"" porque hay gente transgénero en ese grupo.
Vero afirmó que ya lo hablaron en ensayos pasados(lo cual es verdad), ella dijo que va a ser lo posible para no utilizar los artículos(las, los, les) porque ella no se siente cómoda usando les. Ante esto, kei siguió insistiendo y vero dijo que no y que parece una falta de respeto interrumpir así el ensayo, cuando podían hablarlo en el recreo tranquilamente.
Kei siguió insistiendo y terminó por tomar sus cosas e irse diciendo ""me voy a levantar por el resto de personas que quieren proteger su identidad""(o algo bastante parecido) y cerró la puerta algo fuerte. Ante esto otros/as dos chicos/as transgénero también se levantaron pero solo bajaron las escaleras y se quedaron allí un rato, no enojados/as, si no tristes.
Luego logramos calmarnos, pero kei se fue y no sabemos mucho, solo que publicó en facebook que tratamos a la gente con preferencias diferentes como si fueran basura. Hizo quedar mal a nuestro coro que siempre fue de aceptación y un espacio para olvidar tus problemas. Este coro lleva 30 años, y nunca pasó nada similar. Yo tengo 15 años y todo esto me dejó mal, yo apoyo a la comunidad LGTB, tengo mejores amigos con preferencias diferentes, vero también los apoya, pero siento que kei se pasó y entendió mal que vero no los discrimina, pero no se siente cómoda utilizando el lenguaje inclusivo, no podemos obligar a alguien a ser quien no se siente cómodo.
Kei parece una persona, no mala, pero viendo su vida privada, parece que solo hace lo que hace por atención, parece que esto del lenguaje inclusivo no se da cuenta que él lo toma como moda ciegamente.

0,"Is it ever okay to say the n-word if you were raised saying it?. So I was thinking about this and I hope I don’t come off offensive. This is a genuine question and I hope I get genuine answers and explanations as to why it’s okay/not okay. I know this is a controversial topic so please be as understanding as possible because I don’t mean any harm. I do not say the n-word and I have never considered saying it. But this isn’t about me. 

Let’s say you knew someone (Let’s call him S) who isn’t black. But S was raised around black people. He was raised in the hood, surrounded by gangs and drugs and affiliates that were in and out prison. His dad was part of a gang growing up, and when S got out of juvie as a young adult, he joined a gang after also. This person was also surrounded by those whom are predominately those of African American descent, not by choice but because these are the neighbors and peers that he was raised around and the streets he grew up in. S is a grown adult now and he still uses the n-word. 

As S got older, people began to tell him he isn’t black, so he shouldn’t say the n-word. S says well this is how he is and he was raised like this. To him, S says it isn’t a matter of his skin color, but rather this is his upbringing. His peers, friends, family, affiliates, neighbors, etc. never found it a problem for him to say the n-word, and they still don’t. He doesn’t say it racially and he doesn’t say it as an insult. He says it as a friendly greeting way. S says the word because to him, it’s molded into him as a sense of belonging and a sense of community because that is solely what he grew up around. This is part of his lingo or slang if you want to call it that. S wonders why is it that all of his life it isn’t a problem towards those who know him, but it’s only a problem to strangers who don’t know him? He also says he has no ill intention of saying it, and he doesn’t ever mean it offensively. He has said it all of his life, why is it a problem to strangers now? 

How do you guys feel about this? Please explain your answers so I can see things into perspective. We all understand the universal rule of the n-word: if you aren’t black don’t say it. But how would you go about explaining that rule to someone who believes their social environment shaped them and molded them to believe they’re allowed to say it? How do you debunk his thought process? Does he get a pass? Why or why not.

TLDR: Is it okay for someone to say the n-word if they were raised around it and their surroundings made them feel okay for saying it?"

The estimated cost of his health care plan is double the GDP of the US.  His college plan is supposed to be paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation, but the estimated gains from that tax over the next ten years still run a 10trillion dollar deficit when the yearly cost of that proposal is considered.

Suppose that you are now immortal, cannot be killed, and you will live through the ages. Let’s say you have now been transported back to the year....1800. You have until the year 2000 to become extremely wealthy or you will be killed. You must be worth no less than the inflated equivalent of 100 million dollars. That’s 200 years to figure out how you are going to make incredible amounts of money in order to live through the centuries and experience everything fully.

This could be inventing something that hasn’t yet been invented (although you’ll have to actually know how to do this. You can’t just say “electricity” if you don’t know how you would do it.) or perhaps you could create an ever famous story like writing the Harry Potter books, or a very good Beatles song (like that movie).

0,"How to tell if my male coworker likes me. We met in August, though I was in a abusive relationship he knows about but still he would spend a lot of time with me during our shifts (both sales associates ) we work two days a week together 
Signs he does like me: 
•any project I’m working on he always always offers to join me and we do projects together at work.
• we always do projects just us or find ourselves talking the entire day away just us two 
•we smile a lot have a lot of awkwardness I’m really shy when I like someone and am unsure how they feel about it
• 3 weeks ago he hugged me before he left and asked me for my Instagram 
• yesterday he added me on fb ( didn’t ask just added) we have 3 mutual friends 
 
( I messaged him on fb just to break the awkwardness ) 
• he said “ we should make time out side of work to hang out “ and I agreed, so this week on our shift we’re going to be making plans I don’t know if I should take this as. A date or just casual friendly hang out 

Signs he doesn’t like me 
• some shifts we don’t really talk, we’ll hang in different friends groups and just have awkward looks 
• he hasn’t interacted with my insta once sense following me even a cute selfie
• he probably wouldn’t have messaged me if I didn’t message him 

Is he just being really friendly, he is a very friendly guy, or do you think he might be into me a bit? I think it’s pretty clear I like him even though I try to not show it, you can see it in my face

Put aside your differences and help the American people you old fucking boomers. If the virus does hit, it has a mortality rate that is unusually high for elderly. If you don’t stop your bickering, you dumb fucks are going to all die together. Boomers going boom. Then we can put Joe Rogan in office. 

Anyways, be careful of shipments from China. They would out of spite cough in a box or liquid and send it over here to fuck us over. Political bullshit. Fuck...


My questions :

1. Would you vape something from China straight to your lungs?
2. High school bought chinese vape? Got random coronavirus even with not contact?
3. Can shipments from China carry the virus if sealed properly? 
4. Should I begin stocking up on water and emergency food? 
5. Why are all the masks sold out at my local store?? 
6. How do I make a tampon temporary mask?

I don’t personally, but from watching movies and shows set in the medieval ages, I get the the impression that everyone did. For example Vikings S2 : Ep. 5 at around 22 minutes a man says “We are christians here”. This implies (to me) that they are and that every one surrounding them are Christians and that there culture is based on Christianity.

I wonder the extent of this effect compared to modern times in which we are freely able to be atheist. Was every person religious during this time or were some faking it the same some do today?

I hate school and I’ve always hated school. Senior year of hs rn and I can’t bring myself to do any schoolwork I’m cheating on everything.

Im Arab so my family is half doctors half engineers and respect and pride is like priority #1. I know it’ll feel awkward and I’ll feel inadequate within my family if I go into entertainment. My entertainment career plans are definitely less planned out, which means I won’t have a stable income, I won’t have any respect from friends or family, and I won’t know if I could even keep doing it after a few years; burnout, no jobs, losing hype, etc. after youtube I wanna be a stand up comedian but I also have talk show host and rapper on the list.

Context:

Last MP: Jan. 30 - Feb. 3, 2020

Ovulation (acc. to Flo): Feb. 6 - Feb. 14

Expected Period: Feb. 26

&amp;#x200B;

I was raped last February 15. It was supposed to be only a casual makeout with my friend. During foreplay I told him that I can't do penetration because I was not on the pill and we didn't have any protection like condoms. He kept on telling me that to give him a chance and that he wouldn't make any mistakes, still I said no. After foreplay, I gave him an oral. After oral, he proceeded to finger me while still making out but he was slowly taking advantage of me. By this, I mean he was slowly placing his penis inside me. He inserted half of his penis but he didn't thrust. I was so scared that I pushed him away me. It was so quick when he was inside me. Again he didn't thrust. Luckily I managed to push him off. We didn't continue with the penetration because he gave up on me...

&amp;#x200B;

 In the end, he didn't came inside me because he just nudged me to give him a head (still being scared at this time). After this situation, I was so traumatized and scared. I couldn't stop thinking about this feeling being raped by my own friend. I couldn't eat during this day and onwards and I was spacing out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm three days late. I was supposed to have my period February 26. I took pregnancy tests yesterday morning and this morning. Both came negative. I haven't been feeling any pregnancy symptoms yet such as nausea and headaches... My friend said it was most likely I was stressed out because of that traumatizing event and also it was because it was my midterms in school this week..

&amp;#x200B;

Was it too early that I took the pregnancy tests? When can i get for most accurate results? A lot of people say that early and highly sensitive PTs are able to detect after 10 days intimacy. Some people say to wait 1-2 weeks after the intimacy. Some say to wait 1-2 weeks after the missed period. Someone ease my mind please! I haven't been this delayed compared to my past. :("

He says that we are inferring that means they slept together, but that she never admitted to sleeping with him. I think 'in over a year' is just an adjective to 'they hadn't slept together' that reverses the meaning and says they have.

I've made two trips to Thailand for my previous dentures, and considering a third trip to go to the all on 4 implants. Any input would be greatly appreciated."
0,Always remember who you are. (A scary Reddit story I need to find!). It was a somewhat recent horror story called something like “always remember who you are” about a younger man who tutored kids. He fell in love with the mom of a student. They end up together and then something landed on their house and killed the wife and possibly the kid. He was saved by the advice of his father “always remember who you are.” Why don’t I save things like this?!

Sexy androids are really popular.

It’s a real annoyance that the fact that the major phone operating system Android also makes searching for specific kinds of lewd droid very difficult.

I might possibly be pregnant with the child of a man that I’m not in contact with. He has expressed he doesn’t want children. He’s also a very shady and untrustworthy guy with a dangerous past, but I’m at the age where I don’t know if I want to get rid of a pregnancy if it did happen. Our paths wouldn’t cross again if it weren’t for something like this, so a part of me doesn’t want to tell him until the child is older. I just feel like it’d be much easier on everyone involved (including him) if he didn’t even know. 


Morally, I feel obligated. Technically, if he isn’t going to keep up on it or ask, I don’t even have to tell him. My guess is that 95% of you will say it’s ethically wrong not to tell him.

0,"My dad is rapidly losing his mind to brain cancer. He’s heavily medicated, paranoid, confused, has poor short term memory and often has difficulty expressing his thoughts. The more he tries, the more agitated he becomes and we end up talking in circles. What’s the best way to communicate with him?. For context, cliff notes: around June of 2019 my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung and brain cancer. He’s very stoic, doesn’t like to be a bother to anyone, has a very old school way of looking at mental health and tries to be the strong, silent type. He has 3 children that he’s tried to “protect” from this painful revelation and the worse his cancer got (even though we knew, because we can read between the lines), the less he told us. But the brain cancer started to swell, he started experiencing hallucinations, paranoia, wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, and he didn’t tell anyone because he didn’t want anyone to think he was “crazy”. In mid December, in an act that was so outside of his character, our entire community was in mourning... he stabbed and killed my step mother. They had been married for over 30 years. I’m being intentionally vague about specifics for anonymity, but this context is important because dad went from jail, to a hospital, to a secure psychiatric facility that’s more like a hospital. But we can only see him for 30-60 minutes, twice a day (2 hrs per day, max). This adds to his anxiety and frustration because he knows that when he’s trying to explain something to us, he’s on the clock. He’s got to get it out before the nurse comes into our visiting area and tells us it’s time to leave. What ends up happening is, he gets more and more agitated as the timer runs down because of that deadline and we will have sat and wasted our hour with him talking about nonsense.

To give an example, there are about 30 other patients in the facility and he gets a bit of special treatment due to his failing health and genuinely good demeanour, friendliness, reasonableness, etc. He thinks the other patients (“inmates,” he’s been calling them lately) all see this and they’re jealous. He’s worried they might hurt him (they won’t). He thinks the nurses are laughing at him (they’re not). He thinks everyone thinks he’s faking it (no one does). But it’s impossible for us to explain that to him.

I have tried deflecting, I’ve tried redirecting, I’ve tried understanding, I’ve tried having him write it down, I’ve tried to tell him to phone me when we leave and explain it then, nothing works. Last night we sat for well over an hour while he tried in vain to get these thoughts out. At the end, he told us to leave and not come back. I know it’s not him, of course... does anyone have experience with this that can help me expedite his thought process, in order to keep him a little more calm and our visits with him more pleasant?

I’m afraid this is just who dad is now, and we’re slowly losing his lucid self as the days go by."

World Bank launches 'pandemic bond' to tackle major outbreaks
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Bank has launched a “pandemic bond” to support an emergency financing facility intended to release money quickly to fight a major health crisis like the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

The catastrophe bond, which will pay out depending on the size of the outbreak, its growth rate and the number of countries affected, is the first of its kind for epidemics. It should mean money is disbursed much faster than during West Africa’s Ebola crisis.

Ebola spread across the region in the early months of 2014. Michael Bennett, head of derivatives and structured finance at the World Bank’s capital markets department, said that if the pandemic emergency financing facility (PEF) had existed in 2014, some $100 million could have been mobilised as early as July.

In reality, money did not begin to flow on this scale until three months later, by which time the number of deaths from Ebola had increased tenfold.

“In the end about 11,000 people died in that pandemic and it’s estimated that the cost to the countries most affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierre Leone - was about $2.8 billion,” Bennett said.

The PEF will offer coverage to all countries eligible for financing from the International Development Agency (IDA), the arm of the World Bank dedicated to the world’s poorest countries.

It covers outbreaks of infectious diseases most likely to cause major epidemics, including pandemic influenza strains; coronaviruses, including SARS; filoviruses, which include Ebola and Marburg; plus others such as Crimean Congo fever, Rift Valley fever and Lassa fever.

Bennett said the PEF as a whole would provide more than $500 million of coverage against pandemics over the next five years. This includes today’s $425 million transaction, comprising $320 million raised through the bond market and $105 million through swaps transactions.

The transaction was oversubscribed by 200 percent, attracting interest from dedicated cat bond investors, asset managers, pension funds and endowments, the World Bank said.

For the pandemic bond, the World Bank will pay bondholders a coupon that replicates an insurance premium plus a funding spread, in return for a payout if the bond is triggered.

“If a trigger event occurs, instead of repaying the bond in full, some or all of the principal is transferred to the PEF trust fund,” Bennett said. “So essentially the investors are acting like insurance companies.”

Under the swaps transactions, the swaps counterparty pays out if a trigger event occurs.

“The objective of offering the risk in both forms is that the bonds and swaps appeal to different types of investors, and therefore … we are creating the broadest possible investor pool for this risk,” said Bennett. That helped drive down prices.

A replenishable cash window available from 2018 will provide funding for diseases that may not meet the activation criteria for the bond, whilst future donor commitments may be used to purchase additional coverage from the market.

Munich Re, which helped develop the insurance component of the PEF in conjunction with Swiss Re and catastrophe risk modeller AIR Worldwide, said pandemics were among the most likely uninsured risks to occur.

The annual global cost of moderately severe to severe pandemics is estimated at roughly $570 billion, or 0.7 percent of global income, the World Bank said.

0,"I feel lost at life, I dont know what to do. Like alot of people, I grew up with childhood trauma, my parents fighting, getting bullied, abuse etc. I have already worked with different coaches and knowledgeable about them, I have underwent emotional training, have done so much meditation, so much “self improvement” and now im at the point of my life where I am letting go of all of it and just facing the truth, that I am a broken person. 

Im 22 and I have recently started a fast food business, It is not doing the best but we have only opened for 3 weeks. I started when I was 17 with trying to make money, trading in the stock market, online advertising, none were very succesful but I learned alot. Today I can say that deep inside I have done all those work because I was/am unhappy with my life, I wanted to make money because I thought money would made me happy but now I know it wont. 

Now I am here and I just dont know what to do with my life, I dont see a point as life seems so painful and full of pain, I see it in my parents, most people I see, everyone is just trying to be happy. And I envy those people who are contended with their lives, who are able to make meaningful relationships and achieve good things with their lives. I dropped out of college because I just couldnt finish it, i failed alot and took a job at the sales industry. I envy those people who are just happy with their lives. 

So what is the point of me living, what is it for? If its just full of pain and misery, even if I try my best to be “succesful” its still sadness inside. I see this in my parents who have made a comfortable life for themselves, but they struggle everyday, broken marriage, unhappy family, I do not want to grow up like them but it seems like that is where I am heading....."
0,"Why is death so scary?. Every night we sleep, we are basically dead to the world. Your ‘self’ as you know it hasn’t existed for the 13.8 billion years our universe has existed. After we die, our atoms spread out across the universe and become apart of the universal soup of molecules.

I understand the fear of feeling pain before death or leaving behind loved ones, but holding aside that point..Death really doesn’t seem that scary. It’s a beautiful thought in a way. The release of every anxiety, every struggle and all of the angst of being alive in one moment to once again return to the soup of atoms that make us up."

When you picture a dinosaur in your head, do they have feathers?

We made soaps, shampoos, and lotions and the like. I lost my job due to attendance. Over the past year I got sick so many times it was ridiculous. My eyes would also be super dry and irritated by the end of every work day to the point where it was painful just to be in my area. (I later looked online and seen this is a big symptom of black mold exposure). Six months ago they took a massive micro hit because of mold, causing my department (which made the product) to basically shut down for a week. Investigating the mold they found our entire HVAC system that cooled our department was completely full of black mold. They refused to hold back work any longer and just put air filters over all the air vents.

I'm calling OSHA in the morning to tell them about the company's refusal to get the HVAC system cleaned out before we returned to work.

As a beloved fan of fiction, I decided to try my hand at writing. The obvious issue comes with that of assessment. How do you know what you have written is any good.. It feels like a waste to spend time and energy into an idea that is not particularly good, or which the majority of others find that way.
Finding an editor seems simple enough, once the work in complete. What is not so simple however is finding a friend, a confidant, during the writing process to assist you with honest feedback.
For some reason asking your friends feels dishonest, as if you know what they are telling you is an attempt to prevent wounding your pride.

What I propose is a buddy system. An active participant throughout the writing process. You show me your’s, I’ll show you mine. No questions asked. 

Hopefully it will lead to helpful input from both sides and a successful product, possibly making future contacts in the industry from opposite ends of Earth. If not... The brave may not live forever but the cautious do not live at all- so they say."

     This post might be a little too TMI so I apologize in advance.

      So my girlfriend and I recently became sexually active with one another. Things are all fine and dandy except for one thing. She can’t take birth control as she has a suspected allergic/negative reaction to pro-estrogen. She’s tried taking many birth controls but she always breaks out into rashes and blisters. I thought this would be fine with me, ya know just wrap it up and we’re good, problem is I can’t keep it up. 

     We’ve tried lots of different condoms to see if anything could help the issues but nothing seems to help. She feels bad cause she thinks that it’s her fault and it’s not, and I feel bad for under preforming. I thought about taking viagra but I have heart issues and I think that would be unsafe on my part so I looked into male birth controls and they all lower your T levels to that of effective castration and the long term side effects are unknown so I also believe that would be an unsafe choice on my part.

     She’s the first person I’ve had to use a condom with because I’ve always dated people that used birth control or had IUD’s and pulled out a good while before ejacing so I’m wondering if it’s just an adjustment period and it’ll be something I can get used to or if I’m screwed out of that part of our sex life till I can’t find something to keep me up.

     What I’m asking is if anyone has any suggestions to birth control/contraceptives that are relatively effective without the use of a condom. She’s open to the idea without using one for the benefit of both of us we just want to be as safe as possible.

TLDR; girlfriend can’t take birth control due to complications and I can’t keep hard with a condom on or take viagra/male enhancements due to heart issues. What should we do?"

2. Do not try to get your ability back from YouTube. They insist that your life shall be forever demonetized.

3. You are self-sufficient. You CANNOT ask others to spend money for you. You can still trade items tho. 

4. You may receive gifts, as long as it is not currency. The gift cannot exceed $100 USD and you can only receive it once every two weeks.

I hope that eliminates any loopholes. Also, a violation of any of these rules will result in a BAD punishment. Good luck!"

I'm 24, have two degrees, have worked for many years in the same job and feel so stagnant in life. I have so many ideas of what I want to do, but I guess I've reached a crossroads of complacency and fear of the unknown. For me, as long as I'm paying my bills and surrounding myself with positive people, I'm content. But lately I've been craving so much more. I want to be more than what I am, and more than I ever imagined. Recently, I've been inspired by talking to others to find out what their dreams are, accomplishments they're proud of and where they see themselves in 1, 5, 10 years. It's so easy to fall into a routine and lose motivation, but I find that hearing from others really inspires me and gets the cogs in my head turning.

I'm still not sure where I want to go and how I'm gonna get there, but I'd love to hear about your dreams and aspirations, however big or small. Serious replies are appreciated, but have fun with it and let your inner child out. Astronaut and secret agent replies are totally acceptable. And I hope this thread will get enough responses to maybe inspire and reignite lost fires in anyone else who reads and contributes, and that we as a community can bundle together. This world is tough, we are always comparing and being compared, sometimes it's nice to see we're not that fucked up and our dreams are maybe not so far away. 

Thanks everyone!"

I saw this thing on tiktok where you draw yourself how you wish you were, not worrying about being fat, or thin, or tall or short.

I also enjoy making characters in games, where you can change your outfit a lot, have darker skin because I think the clothes look better.

0,"As a man, when walking at night how can you communicate that you genuinely mean no harm?. After a lousy date tonight I was walking to the tram stop and passed a number of women whom I felt uncomfortable for as I am sure they must have felt, by however small an amount, threatened by me in the dark.

I’ve always been self conscious about my skin colour being a tall dark-skinned man but especially in these situations. It didn’t help that I was wearing all black but that is just my fashion at the moment. I purposely take a wide berth and sometimes make noise or call a friend. I would not hurt a fly and would step in to protect strangers from harm and have done so in the past.

Now the last thing I want are any solutions designed trick people into a false sense of security. The world is already terrible enough without the insane amount of violence against women.

What are ways that you can genuinely show you mean no harm when you find you are walking behind/past women at night?"

0,"Why House moved forward with impeachment without witness testimonies. I don’t really care if Trump is impeached or not. In my eyes both parties are corrupt. So hearing these moral arguments from both sides is laughable. It’s like listening to two kids who broke the rules trying condemn each other for breaking the rules. 

I know democrats have been trying to impeach Trump since his inauguration. If he’s guilty he needs to be removed. But investigation after investigation, claim after claim - all leading or pointing to nothing is getting old. God only knows how much this is costing tax payers. This leads to my question. 

Why did the house move forward with impeachment if they weren’t ready or didn’t think the articles would be enough to successfully remove him from office? Why didn’t they get witness testimonies prior and build a case? The articles alone should be enough without witnesses. Is there a legitimate reason why they moved forward so quickly? 

As I currently see it, if he’s not removed it was a waste of time and money and poor preparation from the House. I wouldn’t blame Trump. I’d be upset that he was impeached and not removed. I’d view it as another bs political strategy we are paying for. It’s ridiculous. Why move forward without enough evidence to get it done right?!"
0,"Need Advice on How To Deal With a Cunt. I'm going to write this as a TL;DR in of itself since it would take at least a thousand words to fully explain. That being said, this is anything but an oversimplification. This is just a shorter and less in-depth explanation, and I won't leave anything important out.


So there's this guy in my class, and for the sake of his privacy, I'm going to call him CUNT.

A bit of quick backstory: CUNT and I were in the same class and friend group, and I happened to be dating this girl I'll be calling STACY who was in the friend group. CUNT and I got off on the wrong foot with each other; there is some tension between us. STACY and our other friends were the only reason we hung out together.

STACY dumped me, I did some things I regret* and our friend group basically disbanded and everyone pretty much just went their own ways. 
I was definitely at my lowest, most miserable point I have ever been. 
Surprisingly, besides a super loyal close friend of mine, CUNT was the only one supporting me at that time. 

Of course, this only lasted a few months: CUNT, being a cunt, heard rumours that people didn't like him because he was associated with me, and just stopped hanging out with me.
I asked a few people, even people that did not like me, if they felt this way. They knew we were friends but never 'associated' us together. 
So already these allegations are flimsy, but CUNT was already so far gone it didn't really matter anymore.

Fast forward over a three-month End Of Year break, CUNT had joined a band and had gotten pretty close to the guys in my class.
It was immediately apparent that he had excluded me from hanging out with them.
-He muttered things to people about me in front of me and talked shit behind my back.
-He manipulated others in a way that lead to them thinking of me in a bad way. What I mean by this is that he took his time building up lies about me, one by one, over such a long time.            He literally was willing to spend months SLOWLY tricking others into simply not liking me, and that was what he did.

There was only one time he slipped up and broke his facade.  
This whole time he had never outright said he hated me, but on this occasion, he had let loose. He didn't have an outburst but compared to his sneaky cool-headed behaviour this might as well have been one.
I'm not going to go into detail,  but he basically was talking about kicking me out of the (friend) group in front of me. It was obvious he wanted me to hear it, and it was painstakingly clear my other friends weren't playing along. They were honestly just uninterested and didn't feel any hatred towards me, to they told him to knock it off.
So you can imagine for someone whose plan was going along so smoothly and for him to just be caught red-handed like this, he was clutching at straws trying to make himself look good. He resulted to making fun of my race, and I left for fear of bashing that dumb cunt.

There's more to this, but I feel like I've said enough. Let me know what you guys think and what I should do.

0,"What has been your biggest heartbreak or a painful moment in your life which has shaped you into becoming the person you are today?. I fell in love with a girl and found myself feeling emotions I never thought was possible. It’s cliche that at a young age you fall in love, and it always ends in heartbreak, but in my case, I was always thinking of growing up and how we would fit into each other’s life’s as we move on and find our careers. I was so crazyyyyy in love and I found myself becoming a better person, a better son and a better brother. This ended abruptly however as the girl I loved ended up meeting someone online which lead to them meeting in person and falling in love. 4 years later and it still hurts like it did back then.. I’ve been falling into a pit of darkness and I’m still stuck. Of course I have a select few friends whom I am extremely grateful for but nothing can actually compete with a significant female presence in your life. The love, attention and care a female can give a man is honestly one of the greatest gifts ever. Every single day I always imagine what it would be like to just actually love someone infinitely and be the best possible partner you can be to them. I don’t want stupid amounts of money, fame, lots of friends, materialistic things etc. All I want is to be a good person and I hope one day I do find a significant other and when I do, I promise to love her in every way possible no matter what. P.S. this is my first ever post so if you have made it this far, well done! 😂"

Right now I am struggling with school. I go to a very good school with a very hard curriculum. I am in all honors classes and have tested 13 plus in all subjects since 6th grade. The first semester I had a 3.5 GPA. This semester I am averaging a b- so far. Between bad teachers and not understanding certain stuff, I went from loving learning and school to dreading school. I need a little direction on where I need to go with my life. Btw I play football and have made over 5k working for a construction/landscaping company. I am a hard worker and like working more than school. What is something that I could do that would improve my grades. What is something that I could do that would make me successful, say without a college education. I'm not afraid to work for something but school isn't for me. That being said I'm not gonna drop out, never. I just want a path that doesn't lead to more schooling. My dad didn't go to college and earns 4 times and much as my mom who went to college.

I bullied her for about a year, and I probably would have ended up bullying her more if we ended up in the same high school, but we didn’t (she didn’t leave the district. I live in a city so we have different public high schools all over the city). It took me maybe 2-3 years after my last encounter with her to realize that I was a hypocrite and a dickhead for doing what I did.

So my boss made the incentive to give bonus for every treatment that I close in his office . 
He said if I’m closing treatments almost everyday I could make just as much, if not more than I get paid ... 

However he has not been consistent or truthful  . He has not been consistent with paying . The percentages he say always changes.

Long story short , there was a week where I closed a few treatments . Prices where ($2,000,$700, $1200,$4,300 ,$4500) ...

So, he then told me for closed treatments he would give me one in a half percent of the prices ...

Then he told me he could no longer afford to give me one in a half percent for testaments closed under $4500. AFTER he realized that I could actually close a number of deals. In my opinion , more than he had been willing to actually pay me for ....

0,"Ex-Smokers - How do you quit the habit?. Hey all, so I made the transition to vaping about a year ago, but I feel recently I’ve slipped back into normal cigarettes and I hate myself for it. I’m struggling to resist the urge to roll one up, especially as I’ve found since I’ve recently started driving and do frequent motorway journeys after a full day of work, getting slightly tired I feel smoking a normal cigarette really picks me up and keeps me more alert. 

My main issues I have is that I want to pack it all in, but I’m a sucker for a habit. Having breaks at work I tend to smoke, to wake myself up in the morning - coffee and smoke, If I drink moretime I will scab a smoke off someone (lots of smokers around me), I’m also an avid gamer so I tend to chain vape whilst at my desk or go outside for a cheeky smoke..

It really frustrates me because I have the will power of a Nat, and I feel like it’s more the habit that’s stopping me quitting - even some of the things I mentioned above have become second nature? Especially if I’m on my pc, I’ve tried to put it past me but I get edgy like I don’t know what to do with my hands because I don’t have my vape there.... if that makes sense? Infact I would go as far to say it’s more the habit/second nature than it is the nicotine that’s stopping me from quitting smoking!

I’m doing a run in August and I’m starting to do more cardio at the gym but it’s effecting my breathing as you can imagine...

I’ve seen previous smoke-quitting posts on here, but I was seeking some help that could target the habit side of things, so anyone that’s been in a similar situation or can sympathise with where I’m coming from, please shout up and help a brother out!! If anyone needs anymore information or questions, I’m happy to delve further.

Thanks in advance you heroes of Reddit!"

0,"30 years old with ED problem. I, also practice BJJ and I am a physique competitor, I am pretty healthy and I take care of myself.here is my story but forgive my English.  I went to see a doctor in 2012 when I was22 years old. the Dr. did ask alot of questions to see what the problem such as if i took steroids or have an ‏ ‏anxiety or if I am smoker. I told him I didn't have anxiety or taking steroid or have smoker. He requested a blood test to measure my testosterone level and it was normal. However, he told me its anxiety and prescribed to me 10 pills of Xanax even though I didn't have an anxiety problems. I tried it before sex and it didnt help. I went to see the Dr. and tell him about the results of the Xanax that it didnt work as we expected. Then he  prescribe me a viagra to try, so i took the viagra and tied to have sex, it didnt work like what i expected it just helped a little But not a normal erection regardless the headache it gave me. I went back to the Dr. again to tell him about the situations and he said i will refer you to a urologist. I went to the to see the urologist and he did a urine test and blood test but everything was good with me. He prescribed to me cilices and gave a sample of a sex pill you put in the mouth and let it dissolve. But still they did have the same results as the viagra. I went back to the urologist and he told me i will refer you to one of the best Dr. in the world for ED problems. He sent me to the University of Michigan Hospital in Anarbor. Its 2 hours drive away from me but i hade a hope to fix this problem. I went there and they give something called Rigi scan to measure the blood flow to the peines while a sleep. I took the scanner with me home and did the test. The Machine has to two warriors like a snares one goes to the ring of the pines and the other to the end of it. However i didt for a week before going to sleep it was bad experience  it bothered me a lot while a sleep. I took  the scanner to the hospital to get the data of the machine, the Dr. told me the scanner show that i have anormal blood flow to the pines even though whenever i wake up at night and adjust the annoying machine and see my pines with half erection. I am 30 years of age and my situation it only gotten worst and i woke up now without even my morning erection. I really need some help plz."

0,"Question For All Fathers Out There?. Question For All Fathers Out There?

I’m an expecting father, my wife is due any day.  She is measuring earlier than anticipated and we’ve been advised by our specialist that we need to be prepared for our new baby boy!  

We live in the Chicagoland area, and I also work a full-time job, and was recently asked to take a business trip to Atlanta for training.  This training is routine, as in, they hold these courses monthly.  I advised my regional manager that I would feel more comfortable rescheduling the training, or at least attending in Iowa, so I may at least rent a car to be on my home on a more immediate basis if necessary.  

It was then, escalated to the Vice President of my company, who advised I must attend.  I put my concerns in writing, respectfully as to why I was requesting a different course, and time.  She replied, in order to be a manager within the company, this is mandatory.  Obviously my family relies on my income, so I feel I’m in no place to decline.

I was very disappointed and disheartened, as she didn’t mention my wife, or the reasoning.  I understand that not every company is compassionate or carries a culture of family understanding.  However, I’m wondering, if a woman, who is told that she should anticipate labor at any day, would have been held to this same standard.  

To me, this seems very unprofessional, sexist, and contradictory.  I may not be physically carrying out child, but as a father, I do share the same concerns, and do not expect to be put in a different position than a woman would.  The thought of my wife going into labor on her own is upsetting.  Needless to say, I went.  Because I was told to.  However I’m now viewing this company’s culture and respect for their employees in a completely negative way.

My wife, thank God did not go into labor, and I’m now home.  But I don’t feel I should have ever been put in this position.  Upon my return, I advised that I would not be coming in as my wife was experiencing contractions and it was very probable we would be going to visit labor and delivery, I also advised that I was not feeling well from the trip.  My regional responded, I’m sorry you aren’t feeling well.  Please enter your paid time off for tomorrow.  The rest of the message seemed to be lost, or ignored.  

I’d love to hear some feedback on the topic, and how others would have handled this situation.

Thanks All!"

2 years ago I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and was not given reassuring news unbeknownst to my family. 

6 months ago I was told that my cancer has progressed and surgery may be my only option for surviving it. In a panicked state, I left my family under the pretext of visiting my parents who live out of town and have since watched from afar my family slowly fall apart to the point that I no longer am on speaking terms with my partner and my son bc they think that I have abandoned them.

I have continued getting medical treatment and have found support within the healthcare community but a part of me is feeling crushed under the quilt of not telling my child and former partner.

So I ask you, reddit as a first time poster, should I tell my family that I made the awful decision to hide the truth from them as to why I really left, or let them continue to grieve me and leave them to thinking that I abandoned them and let them continue to build their lives without ever knowing the truth?"

So I’m halfway through my first year in a private institution and it’s pretty much a for profit hellhouse. I was tricked into thinking that it was a good idea. I mean 1 course every 5 weeks. Learn at your own pace. I thought that “wow I can stay at home, work and get a degree.” 

I did not truly know how stupid that decision was until now. For the first couple of course I thought wow this is really easy. No stress, nothing. Then I realized how much it was costing me per class after loans. And how much the program was before loans (55k 😓) I owe the school currently 10k after loans. After just 8 months. 

I know that a lot of people will probably dog on this post but, I’m just not happy. I’m not learning anything towards my degree. They are just milking me with these dumb classes that don’t pertain to anything of interest. The teachers are awful and don’t help with anything and the advisors are just props, that hang out in the back and are not useful. I’m not happy with where I am, I don’t know if this is the degree that I truly want in the long run. 

So the question is, “was dropping out worth it, and how did you plan for the money that you still owed the school.”

Not sure if something like this exists, but essentially what I’m looking for is someone who has beaten a video game and have a recorded all the inputs and thus allowing others to potentially beat the game as well if RNG isn’t an issue. 

Again not sure if this exists but I’ve seen TAS speedruns and would want to copy their inputs to see it work on my computer and essentially try and improve a run.

0,"(Serious)Americans of Reddit: What items from Canada would you most appreciate receiving as gifts/souvenirs?. I’m planning my very first trip ever to Las Vegas in a couple of months - I know tipping culture is heavy and will be sure to have decent cash tips covered, but I would love to bring a few small items as a special touch. I have brought little bottles of maple syrup, Roots mitts, special scented candles and t-shirts or even blankets to family overseas before but figure USA residents may prefer something different, thinking flavoured treats exclusively Canadian such as ketchup chips for example. You guys also have maple syrup and I figure mitts aren’t going to be very useful in the hot climate.

 ""Jord Stephens, the son of one of your residents, has demanded to speak with you. He is angry about a fight that took place in the lounge room of the facility today where another resident tried to punch his father. He wants a lot more supervision of the residents as he is worried that his father might get hurt one day. You need to reassure Jord Stephens that his father is safe.""

The role play has to go for 2 minutes.. but I don't know what type of questions to ask and things to say.. like I know the basics like asking them of their knowledge on the situation and stuff, but other than than I'm completely stuck. On top of that we're doing it in front of the class which is addiing even more stress. Help would be much appreciated and kind of life saving. :)))

0,"Can netflix remove shows from your account because you watch them too much?. So I share a family account on Netflix with s couple of my siblings and we all have different profiles to keep track of what we're all watching. I have this really weird thing (6+ years old) where I need to listen to TV shows to fall asleep, not all TV shows are made equally for this, so there's two specific ones I always watch. This has been going on for ages and I do it everywhere I go and have never had an issue as the series have always been on Netflix. Last night I realised they were off my last viewed and I tried to search them and they wouldn't come up.  I went on my siblings account and she can access them, however, it's like they don't exist on mine.

Has this happened to anyone before? I know obviously j can just watch on someone else's profile it just seems really odd lol.

0,"I didn't cheat, but should I tell her?. So I (M) have been with my girlfriend for almost 6 years and we have an amazing relationship, but I'm facing a bit of a moral dilemma.

While she was on holiday abroad, I went to visit a friend in another city and we went out clubbing. One of her flatmates came out with us, obviously we got drunk, and as soon as she got a chance on the dancefloor this girl was all over me. I told her no, I told her I had a girlfriend, but she just kept leaning in, trying to grind on me, etc. 

Then she got a bit upset (she's quite good looking so I guess she's not used to guys saying no?) and headed outside to the smoking area. I couldn't see any of her friends around and I didn't want her to be out there on her own so I followed to make sure she was ok and reassure her that it was nothing personal, I was just taken - and she seemed to be taking it really well until she tried to kiss me AGAIN. At this point I decided to go back inside.

Largely managed to avoid her for the rest of the night, came home the next day, and my girlfriend is coming home tomorrow.

Here's my issue: I didn't do anything wrong, my girlfriend doesn't know this person and I'm probably never going to see her again. Do I tell her, or would it just make her uncomfortable? Is there any benefit to telling her? But on the other hand, am I morally obligated to?

It was like psychedelic art, where everything is dripping and weird shaped, like it’s all made of goo. The washing machine is a top loader, so you know it was smacking it’s lid open and closed. 

The other dream is a single static shot of a Fred Flintstone decapitation factory. It’s Fred on a conveyer belt, passes under a guillotine, head goes on a different conveyer belt, Fred’s body gets up and walks away. Enter the next Fred.

I’ve always felt different for being someone who would rather listen and I got bullied and made fun of for being so quiet..even by a teacher in high school who mocked me saying my tongue was cut off. I also just realised that maybe it was something deeper and could be also that I constantly had periods of depression and isolation feeling like I never fit in. Sports helped me cope with it cause I could focus all my attention to it but now that that’s not in my life I feel kind of lost. I know I’m not the only one that feels this way. Maybe it’s time for me to get some therapy after all these years of me feeling like this. I know it’s normal to be an introvert but I also have a lot of social anxiety from it.

No, I am not any better than everyone else, I sin too. We have all sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). 
But Thankfully, Jesus Christ cake to earth to save us sinful beings by dying on the cross painfully so we can be saved from hell. John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son that whosever believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life”.

I am not someone who will just recklessly spend, but i also wont be cheap on things I need and on people I love. Like most ppl anyways. 
But he is just, idk... for Christmas he got me a teddy bear, not even a big one, and it is obviously seen it is cheaply made. I was like ""ok"". I wont give much importance to it, its just materialistic.. But now, next week it's my bday. And he gave me my bday preset early, this weekend. And got me another plush toy, again small one. And some keychain w my name on it. But it's not like a fancy, cool keychain, it's plastic and rubber and really ugly. Like, what am I going to do w that shit?
And it's obvious he didn't spend much, nor really gave a thought into it.
Now I feel bad, i mean, i am not overly materialistic person and all, but this make me feel cheap also. It is not that he has no money either. And i see other guys giving an effort, even my friends really trying to get me a perfect gift or experience. Guys hitting up on me with such crazy ideas that also costs them money and time, and it feels nice... and all and he just gets me first cheapest thing he sees. Makes me feel like most important person in my life thinks I'm that, low maintenance? ... And now i feel bad for thinking like that, like i am a bad person for wanting better gifts?
On the other hand, i always get him something i know he needs or wants, and do not like at the price. I often buy him things just out of blue. And ofc he is happy.
He is otherwise really wonderful to me. But idk, i think that when it comes to showing real effort he just backs off.
Like for Christmas i got him original playboys VIP cosmetics and a bong because he likes to smoke. He couldn't hide that he loves it. For his bday he got a book on astronomy that i made an effort to order because there's no such in Croatia, because he spoke about how he would love to learn astronomy... Now i got him real fancy hat and a scarf, not for any occasion but just for tge sake of it, because he was so cheap to buy himself and wore kids winter set and was too small for him and ugly. And he even commented how what i bought him looks like for real gentlemen. And it wasn't cheap either.
And he gets me cheap plush toys. Small ones, so it's not even cute.
Im not asking for him to pay me stuff and such, but just makes me feel so lame. 
I don't know, It makes me feel bad to even mention it to him.
I also dont want someone to buy me stuff because I said so. It loses its magic tht way...
I understand he may not have an idea on what to gice to me. But how other people do? And there's always classical stuff like flowers and chocolate, night out... Oh, i just noticed he doesn't really take me out either and if he does, it's cheap. While when i take him out i don't look at the price.

Even tho I know my legal rights are to be given 30 days. She has put a lock on the basement so I can’t do my laundry and has changed the WiFi password so I can’t do my school work. So since I’m leaving in a few days I figured I’d get back at her, my idea was to get a dozen eggs, put them in nylon and then put them in the vents. Give it a few weeks and the whole house would be stinking. NOW IS THIS ILLEGAL?!"

So I ask you, is there any benefit to switching back to “bath” or should I get over my childhood habit?"
0,"Losing my best friend... Currently I am in high-school, and in my second last year of it. This is very confusing as there’s so much...

Three years ago I became friends with someone let’s call him Luis. Me and him would talk everyday on Snapchat, instagram etc. We never went a day without   not talking to each-other we were inseparable. We had friends before, we were in a group of 4 say 3 technically. We cut them off due to reasons of them fucking me, and him over. The year during we got rid of them, we spent so much time together. We would even skip classes spend days me and him. Just relaxing and nonstop talking. Even everyone in our school said we weren’t complete with each other. If one of us showed up a missing half would be gone. 

Behind the scenes of our friendship we fought a lot, and the prone reason was how I felt that he didn’t give a shit about me. He would never be able to call me his best friend, it was too “girly” for him, even to me it is but I can still say it. I would usually argue about it because I felt so left out, and thought he didn’t care about me at all. Even though we would still get back together and act like nothing happened the next day. Even during the friendship, it seemed that he never wanted to hangout, he would always say he was busy, no time. We didn’t really hang out unless I made the effort. I just feel like the only reason why we hung out is because I always paid for him, always paid for pizza, subway etc just because I cared about him so much cause he was like a brother to me.

Now fast forward today, it’s now grade 11. We’re in a semester based system, and we ended up having all periods together for semester 1, but now semester 2 we have 3 classes. During this he ended up talking to somebody else, and it was always us hanging out together. The new person I do not click with, and he always is just talking to him the whole time while I feel left out. I don’t even get to talk at all really, and it feels so tiring trying to put myself into the conversation. 

We had an argument the other day, and I told him why do you always want to be with him me and you can never just be alone and chill etc. He says it’s more fun with him talking... I said to him I’m done hanging out I feel left out and everything and I’m not going to force myself into the conversation. He just agreed and didn’t care and said okay. 

I just don’t know what to do, I am losing my best friend, my brother this story doesn’t make much sense and it would take me a while to explain the whole thing so I might remake it."

Universe is essentially a physical place to store and process information, for example the observable universe is estimated to be able to house 10^123 bits of information.

0,"How do you heal from overwhelming self sabotaging depression? How do people change?. This is serious, I mean I'm up for some comedic relief but I also want serious advice.

So here's a little backstory and some of my thoughts about it. Also TL;DR warning.-

So beginning of this week, someone I've been dating for 5 years and carrying my child broke up with me. Now, I'm not gonna throw a pity party for myself because I truly did fuck up. Im not gonna beg her to be with me again because I truly need to change, not just for my future child but for myself too. I didn't realize how messed up our relationship have gotten, I didn't realize how toxic I was. The night she left, I did something unforgivable, I didn't hit her or anything like that but I did severely hurt her feelings, which is just as bad. She broke up with me at the beginning of this week and I was broken, I kept rewinding our relationship for the next couple of days trying to figure out what went wrong, where I went wrong. That turned into rewinding my life, remembering the abusive relationship right before this, remembering how abusive my mother was after she became severely addicted to heroin, my first memory is watching my father slam my mother into a wall, the next day he forced my hand on to a hot stove for turning off his Super Nintendo, my mother told me both her and my father's parent were relentlessly abusive, my mom was raped at a very young age and I'm not sure what happened to my father because she didn't talk much about it and he left when I was 5, this disease has been passed down my family like a dark heirloom. In fact now that I think about it, all my siblings have the same issue as me, how mean we can be. Anyways started comparing this abuse to hers and thought I wasn't that bad. But that's not up to me to decide, it's up to the victim.. Maybe what I said wasnt that bad but what about the future? I don't want that for her, I love her too much for that. So I've accepted it, I don't want her to give me another chance because will I really change? Probably not, Im not gonna bounce into another relationship because who does that help? I want to be in my child's life but I need to change. She told me that she didn't want to leave me, that she was scared, hurt and felt broken down but she needed to do this for her. She's right, she did and I can never forgive myself for that. I didnt want her to leave me either, I cried everyday now, I got sleep crying and wake up crying but I know the truth of what needed to be done. Thursday night, fourth day of the breakup, I told everyone i loved them, wrote a letter to my ex and my future child, hugged my best friend and his girlfriend and walked over to a local stream, I cut myself three times to let myself feel pain for what I have done. I was a minute away of slitting my throat because I was afraid of doing this to anybody ever again. But then I stopped, looked at a picture of the first ultrasound, cried, contemplated it some more and thought, who the f--- am I helping? All I would do was cause more pain to even more people by doing this. My siblings would be devastated, my ex? She would be in even more pain, my best friend? I don't how he would deal with it with his own severe depression. I don't need to kill myself, I need to change. 

But how do I really start changing? I mean really change, I got a job hunting on Monday and I'm planning on getting health insurance and going to start counseling. I never want to do this to anybody ever again, definitely not my child. I already love my child to death and I don't even know their gender yet. But I'm afraid, I'm so f------- scared to do this to my child or anybody else. I need serious advice, what do I do? How do I stop this viscious cycle? How do I fix myself?"

0,"Anyone has met people from past lives?. This is exactly how I met my best friend. Third day of middle school, I had just made friends with a group of friends who had known each other since elementary school. They had said that they were a group of five friends but the fifth friend hadn’t gone to school that day. As a kid that had been bullied all throughout elementary school, I was very nervous about getting the approval of this mysterious fifth friend so that I could hopefully become part of the friend group. Well, finally the next day comes around and I meet the girls at the hallway, amongst them, there she is, my long lost friend. One look at her and I just knew, I knew there was whole life I had lived with her, even if I couldn’t remember when or where. Eight years later and she is still my best friend. 

Anyone has similar stories? Like meeting someone for the first time but knowing deep down that you already know them and have known them for longer than you have been alive."

So you couldn’t get it on like Xbox or steam. I remember the game being about this kid that had his family in like a car accident and he had to find the sister I think? Or the mother? These are just based on vague memory. So you would go through this 2D world and find these what I remember being like “tornado like ghosts” and you would have to like save the game at these beds.

I am an over thinker I have 1 sister and one brother and my brother and me have basically the same problems with our brains except I have really bad desperation and anxiety and I also have chronic mono and also schiz etc, I’ve had friends in the past that turned on me for no reason so fst fwrd back to my friend now after hanging out a lot we don’t really talk to each other when we hang out and he also makes plans to hangout with me or he will text me saying we are gonna hangout today or the next day then he will ignore me or make up excuses to not hangout, I’m in no way a person that will track you but the other day he told me we are hanging out that day and he said about to come scoop never came ignored me 5 hours later he says wya I’m otw and then ignored me again until the next day, then he explained that he had a really bad headache well I told my other friend I’ve know way before them and he was like, oh he’s not even home he’s been at X house all day (X=other friend) well what do you know they were smoking weed all FUCKEN day( idc about weed I mainly want to hangout with a “friend”) I never feel comfortable talking to him about my personal problems anymore because he either always connects it to him and starts a whole different conversation without letting me finish why I feel so FUCKEN tired of the bs and extremely depressed and he’s the only person that actually used to care and listen now he just won’t say anything or say sucks or he will try and connect it to something.

(Note 2) when we do actually hangout now he makes a whole big deal the day before that we are gonna hangout (in a good way) then the next day he picks me up and says “my mom said I can only hangout for an hour or a couple hours or he will be like I can only smoke this blunt( he is 20 and honestly I know his parents very well and they don’t tell him to come do shit ever)then he has to drop me back off at home and then he goes to other friend houses I’ve been to and I’m cool with the people.


(Note 3) he will tell me we will hangout later I have to do something with my parents (let’s say he said it at 3pm) and then he won’t respond to shit until late that night saying he is watching a move with them movies don’t last 7-8 hours,) and most of the time we won’t hangout he will text me at 10-11pm saying sorry my parents didn’t want me leaving) 


PLEASE HELP ME WHAT SHOULD I DO HONESTLY 

I feel betrayed, and used, and my overthinking won’t stop and I continue to believe that I did something wrong but I’m just a FUCKEN poor man that everyone doesn’t want to talk to( I will never and have never used anyone for anything if he smokes me up I find a way to smoke him back up but he know it might take a while with my situation I’m in)"

0,"Does anyone work at Waste Management in Michigan or as a curbside trash collector anywhere in the US? My neighbors are online bitching up a storm about our service and I want some facts before responding.. Hello, need some info before I lose my shit on my neighbors.  My city’s Nextdoor website has turned into a cesspool of non-stop bitching about everyone (but themselves, of course).   There was thread bitching about how fast the Fed Ex drivers drive through the neighborhoods, and ppl were bitching endlessly about the drivers, when in my opinion the blame should rest equally, if not more, with the Fed Ex company for pushing their drivers so much.  We knew a guy who worked for Fed Ex and he talked a little how they have him timed via GPS, that his timeline was tough to meet without really hauling ass at times, and that dispatch would actually call him if he ran behind.  So seemed to me that my neighbors should be more upset with the company than with men busting their asses trying to keep a job the make a living. 
So...now everybody in town is losing their minds about our garbage collectors driving too quickly and not sitting their empty cans neatly back upright at the curb with the lid tightly in place (some flip lids, some detached lids).  Which makes me wonder, is it more often just laziness and carelessness on the part of the workers (which is the opinion of 99% of commenters), or more a matter of the workers being on such a tight time schedule that meeting all speed limits exactly and gently placing cans back on the ground with the lid tightly closed is pretty much unrealistic while still getting their routes completed in time?
I’m just frustrated with ppl being mad at the little guy all the time without holding employers/corporations to account, but don’t know the specifics on the workload (how many houses per day), so don’t want to comment in the piranha pit without facts, because another thing these ppl DO NOT like is someone that might voice an opinion (even nicely stated) that goes against their circle jerk rant sessions.

He needs help with eating ( he can pick up a chip and put it in his mouth but has a lot of trouble trying to use a fork. He is confined to an electric wheelchair. He is mentally mostly all there and can be a great laugh! He struggles with accepting some concepts and is a little immature and full on.He cares very deeply for the people close to him, which is few unfortunately as most people he considers his friends are people that have the 5 minute conversation with him to feel good about themselves for befriending the ‘disabled kid’. He doesn’t quite realise this though and will message these people constantly to hang out and will either get no replies or promises which never come to fruition.
At the moment he is struggling with trying to find purpose in his life. He really wants to do something that will make him important and loved by all, for example he has wanted to be an veterinarian,firefighter, race car driver and unfortunately his physical limitations make these goals very unattainable.
He is about to turn 18 and finish high school (he has a support worker at school that helps him read and writes for him)and I’m worried about what’s going to happen next for him. 
Has anyone got any suggestions of career paths or something he can volunteer for that is going to help him feel important and contributing to society? He loves sports and all the manly things that most 17 year olds are into.
Does anyone also know of any support groups in Australia that he can attend to meet some true friends? At the moment His other support workers and I are probably the closest thing he’s got."

0,"Bought a house for my mom and brother. Should I keep this a secret?. I recently purchased a multi-family for my mom and brother to live in and get some rental income.  I feel pretty proud I was able to pull this off and take care of my mom/brother.  However I am conflicted about sharing this news with my close friends.

Obviously I am pretty financially successful and generally I keep a low profile.  When I bought my first property I really didn’t tell anyone until way after.  I’ve feared in the past showing off would only bring bad things like jealousy.

However recently my friends have been purchasing their first homes and showing them off on Instagram or even inviting friends to visit to show off their new house.

Now I don’t really feel a need to show off that much but I would like to share my accomplishments and celebrate with my friends.   Should I share with them my good news or is this not worth it and am I only inviting more trouble?"

0,"Are commission based jobs worth it vs a box retail store?. As of right now I’m 22 years of age in FL. I work at a major big block retailer store at just around $15.60 an hour. I work with all types of electronics, from laptops to gaming consoles but mainly focus on TVs and High end Audio. No commission, strictly hourly wage with health care and 401k taken out of my checks bi weekly. I’ve been with this company for around 3 years and have been moving up quite nicely, recently applied for a supervisor position that I have not heard back from yet.

I recently was offered a job around 40 miles away (good hour and a half or so of a drive with traffic) commission based work with spiff on protection of a high 18% total with a base weekly pay of $600. Which is already higher than my current job. But this job is mainly focused on appliances. I have a friend that lives local and drives to this store every day 6 days a week and has been making really decent money. (almost double what I make at my non commission based job.) I’m afraid I wouldn’t enjoy or do well within this environment, but I’m eager to make double the money I’m making now. As I’m wanting to focus on my future and build a life.

My biggest thing is losing my currently “set in stone” job I have for a job I’ve never done before especially commission based, and only focusing on one thing such as appliances.
My worry is I won’t do good in a commission based job and won’t be able to pay my bills, or even set my self behind if some months I’m not doing well. Also this company doesn’t do 401k because of how much $ you can make. Anywhere from 65-120k a year depending on sales.


TLDR; got offered commission + protection spiff based job selling appliances, versus the all around electronic retail based hour salary I work currently. Would be a small increase of bi weekly pay but is an hour and a half drive, which would increase $ of some bills such as gas, etc.. what’s your opinion on commission based jobs? And would they benefit more than a normal company big box store?"
0,"Is growing up real or just an age difference?. Dear redditers,

I’m about to turn 18. In the Europe it’s kind of a big thing cause you get to do all kinds of exciting stuff like drink alcohol and buy cool shit. I finally get to drive on the real road and be a free man. Im almost an adult. But at the same time I feel like I am the least grown-up out of all people I know. I kind of compare myself to a 12 year old who likes to get drunk.

It just now hit me that with turning 18 I have to be responsible and serious because a lot of things will change and I one step closer to living on my own and provide myself. It all seems to go so quickly, I can see myself turning 50 already. I don’t want to grow up.

Don’t get me wrong, I am not affraid of progressing in life. I don’t want to stay the same age forever. I’m just scared that I will turn into a boring old prick like my dad. So here is my question; 

Does growing up also mean losing your fun impulsive young personality? Or doesn’t the age difference mean anything?"

When you push yourself to be more social but still can’t make one meaningful connection/relationship?
In my case, I don’t know if this is the result of being raised in a culture where boys and girls are separated in the society and dating is considered a taboo or simply because i’m an introvert and I just can’t give myself a chance (or both) You know some of us are just not the party going/hanging out at the bars type.

It reminded me of my funniest story, which I'll tell below. But I want to hear yours. Funniest / most interesting / wildest / most awkward sexual encounters. They are always entertaining! 

My story.  A long story. 

When I was 19, a young, dumb student I was out one night with friends and we had arranged to go back to a bar that our buddy was working in. He was going to be closing up that night by himself so we were going to back before closing time and drink all night in the pub with him. It's known as a ""lock in"" here. 

Anyway, I pulled a girl that night and she came back with us to the pub. Her and I and 5 of my mates. So we are all drinking in the back lounge of the pub. There's a pool table and juke box and we're all having fun. Things start to get hot and heavy with me and the girl so my mates, being good friends leave us alone in the lounge and move back to front bar. So we block the door and go at it fast and hard right there on the pool table. We were fairly drunk so it was pretty wild. Lots of position changes and theatrics. So after we finish up and get dressed, we head out to the bar, get a drink with the boys and act like nothing happened. 

This is where it gets funny. 

So I'm sitting on one side of the table with a couple of the boys and she's opposite me with her back to the bar. My mate who works there was standing behind the bar looking at me and without flinching he turns on the tv behind the bar.... On the tv is a pool table. It takes me a few seconds to realise that it's a live feed from the security camera in the lounge. All the boys erupt in laughter when they see my face change in realisation that they had all Sat at the bar and watched the whole show start to finish. He turns off the tv before the female lead saw the tv. She had no clue why every single one of them were falling over laughing. I had to get her out of there. So I made some shit excuse and got her outside and into a taxi. I went back inside and I Sat there with 5 of my best Friends and we laughed our asses off. We drank the night away and watched the video back, I gave my directers commentary and they gave their compliments and criticism. (I made sure the video was permanently deleted after). 

It was hands down the funnest night we ever had. (Well it was fun until we left the pub at 9am. Hangover from hell.) cherish nights like that with your mates, because they don't last forever. To be young and dumb again!"

I’m not allowed to know the garage passcode to get into my own house and I can’t be there alone, all because I went to a friends house without asking. He’s taking me out of the sport I love because I missed practices and he never gives me any freedom. He also makes me put my phone on the counter at 8:00 at night, and if I don’t have it there by 8:00, I’ll get it taken away. Whenever I’m around him he’s always in a bad mood and is yelling at me about something. I try talking to him about how he is and he doesn’t see the problem and somehow turns it around on me. I tell my mom about everything and I’ve started staying at her house more but she can’t support me financially like my dad can. I just need him to let go and give me some freedom for once. It’s too much being stuck in a house with him being crabby and I can’t deal with it anymore. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even want to be around him. Any tips?"

I don’t have phone service where I live and he had my vehicle. I wouldn’t of never known he went if he had came back home in time from “work”. It gets later and later. Eventually it’s 3 am. He should of already been home at 7pm. We’ve had problems with this female in the beginning of our relationship. But he choose to run off with her that night. I have my mother pick me up the next day Thursday. Calling all the hospitals and jails. No answer at all. I started messaging him Emergency call me. He finally does call. I told him our son needed to go to the doctor because he did, he was suppose to go yesterday but he had to work. He hang up and says that’s not a emergency. I call furious back asking where’s my car. I message his dad saying if he doesn’t return my vehicle I will be calling the cops. I’m not stupid. He eventually talks to me and says he was hanging out with his people and got drunk. I asked if he hung out with her he says no. Then hangs up on me because he got another call. Calls me back about 30 mins later and says yeah I hung out with her all day. Hangs up again. I’m devastated. Crying and yelling. Not knowing what to do. I go hang out with my friend and smoke, while my children are with my mom. He calls me on the phone and where talking then he says you can ask her what happened and she’s been on the phone with us the whole time. So when they were hanging out he took her son to the doctors even though ours needed to go. He went there to find answers after us being together for 4 years. Then slept in her bed with her. She said they didn’t do anything. 🙄 He basically breaks up with me in the phone. Then hangs up and continues to text me. I stop texting. I tell him that people who care keep texting. Then Friday Valentines Day. I hang out with my children and come back to the house. He later shows up dropping my car off and later eventually comes inside and gets undressed from “work”. We talk and of course my feelings get the best of me. And we’re back together. But whyyyyy"

0,"Reddit, What’s the worst streak of bad luck you had? I don’t think you can top mine. Hey Reddit,
Currently in my bed writing this post...
For the past 2 weeks the following things happened to me, are you ready?

1) Saturday 8/2 while I was snowboarding my wallet fell from my pocket somewhere off-piste. I had everything inside along with my annual pass for the resort + cards &amp; id’s
2) 2 hours later while flipsliding on a rail I completely tore my PCL and MCL.
3) I didn’t know this had happened since 13/2 that I got the MRI results. The doc told me I need to get a surgery in 2 months and have a brace on 24/7. I wont be able to snowboard till next winter, and I’ll be able to run and exercise heavily in 5-6 months.  
4) I spent around 1.200$ off my savings for a new board , jacket, pants &amp; boots literally 3 days before this happened.
4) on 14/2 after loosing my wallet, ePayments, a digital wallet like Revolut got suspended due to weak anti-laundering systems. I had 3k USD inside that are now “frozen” until further notice
5) on 16/2 my girlfriend got really sick and I haven’t seen here since then. Today that she felt a bit better her period came as we expected.
6) Today I got sick as well, currently with a fever of 38,5 celsius degrees + a brace keeping my leg straight. 

Frankly I don’t know what else is gonna happen, I’ll let you know but I’d really like to know your stories of bad luck streaks!

P.S: I know there are more important things that can happen and I should’t be bitching about it but you can’t deny , a broke guy with fever and a tore PCL that hasn’t gotten out of bed today and will be able to exercise in 6 months is a bit f***ked up!"

0,"DnD hand written scrolls. Greetings dnd players of reddit. This is my first post ever. I am a dnd player and an amuture DM. During one one of my sessions I thought it would be a good idea to have a hand written scroll to try and some add some emersion to the role play for my players. Luckily my wife has proficiency with calligraphy and the tools and supplies to help me. I gave her the message needed and she went to work. After showing me it to me and we both agreed it was perfect, we rolled it up and gave it a wax seal (it was coming from the bardic college master to his pupil) and on game night I handed to the player. He was impressed and loved it so much he tried to open it without breaking the wax seal. The rest of the group also loved it. That player who received the scroll is also a more experienced DM for group and enlisted my wife's help to write a scroll for our other campaign and once again the group was thrilled to receive a little prop that added that bit extra to our role play

The question I have for you all, DM's and players alike, is this something that people would like to have in their games? A customised hand written scroll/messages with colored ink prop for avid dnd players? Depending on feed back, my wife is thinking of selling these scrolls on etsy. So also what do you think are fair/good prices for hand written ink calligraphy prop scrolls?"

No cell phone activity. Phone is dead and phone company can only provide last location (which was already known) 

Does not have credit cards or bank account (irs problems) someone has access to his email and can see if there is any activity there or via pay pal. There has been none. 

Was driving from FL to philly for work. Never showed up for work. 

There has been an extensive outreach by family and friends to people he knows or may know. Absolutely no one has heard or seen him. 

He is an alcohol and previous drug addict. I believe the police have checked hospitals and jails (possibly rehabs) 

Because he could be in quite a few states I am trying to find information on what to expect from the police. How good is the communication between states? What are they required to do? How thorough are they? I’m assuming a 55 yr old male is not a high priority for them. 

Been searching through Reddit for any good posts related to police procedures and things we should ask them. I am having a hard time finding anything.

So to give background - the other night my wife and I were going to have sex, but I noticed that I wasn’t really in the mood. I was able to ‘get it up’ but it wasn’t as hard as it normally is. I ended up not being able to finish. The next day I still had the same issue. 

Being a little freaked out, I went to the doctor and they ran blood tests and took my urine. All came back normal, including T levels. 

Yesterday I noticed that I have slight discomfort in my left testicle/scrotum area. The bottom of the left testicle has a knot or cord that’s a bit tender. The left teste is a bit swollen as well.

0,"CrApple brand protest. Reddit! I have had MacBooks for years, bought an Apple watch, and currently have an iPhone 6. For Christmas I was given air pods.

My phone is four years old and is in great shape physically. Unfortunately I cannot put anything on it; I was told by a Verizon employee that Apple sets their updates to take up more and more space with each update and you cannot do anything about it so you eventually just have to buy a new phone.

My old MacBook crapped out so I bought a new one recently. The battery is horrible! It's like a cheapo version of what I used to have. I've had non stop issues with my air pods shutting off while I'm on the phone with a call. I bought my fiance a series 4 Apple watch for Christmas and it's had glitching since the day it was opened.

All of this makes me never want to buy an Apple product again. The company used to make quality reliable products. Now everything just seems cheaply made and expensive. I feel like people are paying for the brand name only at this point.

This all being said I desperately need a new phone. Has anyone made the switch to non Apple with limited issues?? I heard crApple makes it super hard to switch. Any recommendations on a great phone alternative to the new iPhones?? I just want a quality reliable easy product. All phones are crazy expensive these days, is that so much to ask?"

We have a three-year-old daughter and an almost 1-year-old yellow lab! We are expanding our family dog wise...we visited 2 shelters, The first time our dog met one of the pitbull’s my husband wanted but she wanted to devour her and I didn’t expect much because this dog had a mom that was very overprotective so I thought it’s because of that relationship it would be hard for them to get along. So we went to another shelter that week and we did not have a dog it was a much bigger facility very clean and nice I think we saw three more pit bulls and the thing is when we were looking at them and they’re a little apartments they had some information about them and it was all good that they were housetrained great with children good with other dogs gentle lovely or just all the school wonderful things and we got excited naturally we would ask to see them personally so we can see if it would be a right fit for us, but lo and behold every single time we would see the dog somebody would come in with background papers and then talk about how horrible and dangerous they were and how they’re not good with kids they’re not good with other dogs I was just standing there with my husband confused are we being falsely advertised or do they discriminate against the spread like what’s going on?? We were just upset because we felt like we were being lied to the one that was on the second strike was the one that really bonded with my daughter the most they were having fun and he kept giving me lip kisses and it broke my heart that we weren’t able to take him I understand that if they are not fit for a home with another dog and kids they should really advertise honestly it’s just not fair to the dog they connected with my daughter and myself and my husband all to be taken back into that box it’s just not right... I even have pictures saved on my phone hoping that they have a happy home you know... as for my husband he had to go to the last plan and it was to buy A puppy pitbull which he did and we are getting her in a couple weeks we are very excited and hopefully this way the dogs grow up together and with my daughter and it will be better for us to mold our dog and train her and make sure that we socialize her with a lot of people and dogs.... but yes I don’t have experience with shelters but my first experience wasn’t great it was just really confusing and sad and I hope it’s not like this everywhere..."

0,"Pilots of Reddit, why do you give weather updates and other trivial updates to passengers who don't want to be bothered?. I find it annoying when I'm trying to sleep, or watch show or movie during a flight, and the pilot makes an announcement, usually containing no useful information.  It's usually a weather update or some update about clear skies ahead, or something that makes me feel like the pilot just wants to talk over the intercom.  Why do pilots feel the need to be weather reporters?  If I'm taking a flight somewhere, I'm not waiting until I'm in the air to prepare myself for the weather conditions at my destination.

0,"How to get over these thoughts. Hi, so my now girlfriend we’re dating talked a lot about her ex, when we were together she would compare me and her ex almost everywhere, but she always said that she did it because im better. Recently she told me that she talked that much about her ex because she still cared for him. She’s my first one while her ex took hers V card and then she told me that her ex treated her like trash, didn’t care for her, but she still slept with him really fast after they started dating. How do i loose this thoughts and anger, that i treated her really nice, flowers, suprises, cared for her, drove 300km just to see her, but she still gave her V card to him really soon, while with me waited for like 4months to do it. And she still slept with him even though she noticed that he’s treating her really bad and still cared for him and also was thinking about him while being with me."

My bf had this girl two years ago, he flied to see her,since they met online, to another country and they were so in love but since it was long distance, it didn’t work out for them. They started talking again recently and I see that it is not just a friendship. He keeps telling her that he loves her and she is the best, while he ignores me totally. He makes me confused from time to time, cause I feel ignored but then he tells me that he loves me but doesn’t show that. Recently I stopped believing that he actually loves me. 

Actually, after she entered his life again, he stopped showing me his love and care. I feel unwanted and unloved. Even though I still took care of him, I still continue to fulfill his needs and show him extra love, but he makes me feel
Like he stopped loving me. He puts so much effort in the conversations with that girl, but when I text him or call him, I get ignored most of the time. 

I wanna reach out to her and ask her if they have feelings for each other, so I can back off. I know that I can ask my bf, but he is not telling me anything. I feel like I am the second best.

So, I was in a Chinese buffet last night and I noticed all the staff seemed a little stressed. I don't know why I'm thinking of this after the fact, but I'm thinking of things like what those employees go through during their days, what working in that type of business is like, and what are some ways that customers could help lighten their moods when we visit. This doesn't even have to be just about the Chinese buffets. Let's include everyone that works in the food industry. 

Some things I already do are 


1. cleaning my table before I leave to make their job just a little easier.


2. If I notice it's busy, I typically order a water along with my drink so the waitress doesn't have to fill my cups up as frequently.

3. I make sure to leave a tip. Even if the waitress didn't do an exceptional job, I still tip.


I understand these are just common courtesy, so what things might I be missing that we, as customers, should try to do in order to help spread the good vibes? Also, as the title asked, I'm curious about what you consider hard about your work day and what you would change?

0,"Should I attend my best friends memorial?. My best friend of many years passed away a couple weeks ago. His memorial is tomorrow morning and I am not sure if my presence there will be met positively.

Some back story
My friend (whom I will refer to as J from here on) and I unfortunately got pretty deep into the drug scene together. We had already both done drugs before we met, but our influence on each other greatly increased this. I am not proud of any of it, but it's the truth. Anyways, we had a pretty bad falling out about a year ago. We recently had started hanging out again because I had reached out to him.
Well about a week into the rekindleing of our friendship, we had decided to pick up some oxy 30s from a friend of ours.
That day J also got his prescription of kolonopin filled. After picking up the 30s, he traded me some of his kpins for a couple more of the 30s that I had, because I had more of them than he did. He dropped me off at home, and that was the last I ever saw him.
I hadn't heard from him for a few days, so jokingly I sent him a message saying, ""you alive""
A few days later right after work I found out he had died in his mom's driveway the previous Sunday, the same night we got the 30s, the same night I gave him a couple extra. He died from mixing alcohol with an overdose of oxy with kpins. Because of this I feel partly responsible for his death and it's been killing me. If I never would have reached back out to him and made him aware of the oxys we could get, maybe he would still be around. Or maybe if I didn't make that trade, he wouldn't have had enough of it to OD. We had been doing the oxys ever since we started hanging out again.

So his memorial is tomorrow, and I am sort of afraid to attend. The day he died, he had accidentally butt dialed me. I overheard his mom tell him, ""you better not come back here all fucked up, you always let OP talk you into stupid shit.""
I also sent him msgs on Facebook saying I regretted trading him the oxys for kpins, because I had less than I thought. Someone in his family (I'm assuming his mom) ended up seeing those msgs after gaining access to his phone after he died, along with my ""you alive"" message. So all of this makes me feel like his mom might majorly blame me for her son dying, and I don't want to cause any drama at the memorial. Do you guys think I should attend? Me and him were extremely close, he lived with my family twice. I can't stop feeling like I am at least partially responsible for his death, and I really just don't know if I will be welcome at his memorial. What do you guys think? Thank you
Tldr:best friend dies after we get drugs together, not sure if no should attend memorial because I feel responsible"

I won in our fight in Freshman year, while he won in Sophomore year and Junior year. 
Although Sophomore year was a close fight, as he won 2 of the 3 rounds, the tiebreaker of which he got me in a headlock, but unfortunately nobody called him on it.
Essentially, I have one final chance to kick his ass and restore my honor. However, I don’t know what I need to do to be prepared for this fight and to win. 
Headshots, headlocks, crotch shots, and anything too violent are instant disqualifiers.
My rival is a few inches taller than me, and is very skinny and has some muscle on him. I’m still rather tall, and have a heavier frame but about the same amount of muscle. 
The fight is at the end of May, so I have time to train, practice, and prepare myself for it.

They state they will try and deliver between 8.30am-9pm but will try to get to offices before 5.30. I got a text that night at 10pm to say they had been delivered which was obviously too late as my girlfriend had left work at 6.15 to meet me for a meal. (Valentines day was on a Friday so flowers would have died over the weekend had they actually been delivered) when my girlfriend arrived to work on the monday there where no flowers no card and no attempted delivery as CCTV Proves no one delivered or even attempted throughout the whole day. Today i contacted the live chat and they said ;the driver delivered them to security who then rang the florist back to say perishables could not be left at the office after he supposedly already signed for them? And had no idea who even sent the flowers to have a number to call back... they then said they sent another driver to drive  back to collect the flowers from the office which is obviously bull****. They are now saying they need to contact the florist who they sub the order out to but this is the second time they have said they are contacting them and am yet to have any response apart from the obviously lie the women on live chat gave me and its been a week and 4 emails. 

What should i do? Any help much appreciate"
0,"Should I buy my friend a house?. On phone, formatting issues.. blah blah. My (38f) friend (52m) of 20 years has type 2 diabetes and has had a stroke. He’s currently on a fixed income with disability and an annuity his dad set up before he passed away. It amounts to about $1100 a month. He lives in Anchorage, AK and has been at the same apartment for his entire adult life (28yrs). The rent is currently $900 for a two bedroom. This is unsustainable without a roommate. He is incredibly set in his ways of having his computer desk over-take the whole living room area which he also basically sleeps at... none of the carpet or paint has been updated and he has had a cat that didn’t often hit the litter box target. I struggle to use the word ‘neckbeard nest’ but it comes to mind. Therefore there is a distinct lack of roommates knocking down the door wanting to live with him. I have great credit (800+) and a 50k down payment ready and able to buy him a very decent condo. He has asked me to help him out by doing this for him. We would set up a long term lease to keep things clean and simple. Buying him this condo would be a win-win as I see it. He’ll cut his rent in half and pay down the mortgage. I help out a friend and create a retirement investment for myself. Here’s the problem Reddit folks: I recently had some mental health trouble that landed me smack dab in the middle of a psych ward (slashed my wrist) and whenever this move gets ‘too real’ for him he screams very hurtful things at me which play mostly on my past and mental health issues. He will hang up on me and proceed to ignore me for a week. I have not raised my voice at him. This has been going on for two months now and I’m at my wits’ end. 

So! My super lovely sort-by-new redditors here it is: Do I grin and bare it knowing he’s just panicked about this huge change and lashing out at me? Do I still buy him a place for his - and my investment portfolio’s - own good because he’s been my friend for 20 years and literally has no where else to go; OR do I fuck right off and spend this investment money elsewhere? Pretty please for your help guys! I’m feeling quite sad and confused. Thanks! 

P.S. Let’s not suggest I take the money over to the wall street bets subreddit. I value my coin and have no need for such fancy amounts of stress."

0,"Am I the only one who seems to self-sabotage while trying to improve yourself?. I’m down 30lbs since November (Not here looking for applause or anything). Finally started making real progress after years of trying many different general methods. I made great progress in the first two months, but I had a good month, where I was taking too many liberties, and not being focused/committed to my plan. 

I noticed after reflecting on why, and I realized there is some type of fear/nervousness that is always in the very back of my head about being thinner or more fit than I have ever been. 

I’ve always had a gut since I hit puberty. I’ve typically been about 50 lbs overweight and I’m VERY intent on finally kicking it to the curb, but it’s like I have identified as being a “big guy” for essentially now, my whole life. My fat is distributed in a way that makes me seem strong, when in fact, I’m really just chubby.

0,"What are your weird eating habits?. 
Emotional eating is something I’ve been struggling with the past couple of months, after a few traumatic events in my life. My weight keeps fluctuating up and down along with my emotions. I’ve never had this problem in my life and all of a sudden it has become something I struggle with everyday. 
Whenever I am sad or stressed, I turn to food for comfort. I feel like I am going to starve, or I get this weird “empty” feeling, if I don’t stuff my face right away, even if I just ate. Then I eat a shitload, feel horrible about it and the cycle continues. But, whenever I am happy, like whenever something really good is happening to me or I have something going on in my life that makes me hopeful, I don’t feel the need to eat. I don’t get hungry, feel the want/need for junk food, or really even think about eating. Whenever I have tried to talk about it with others, they find this pattern of eating strange. Most of my friends/family refrain from eating when they are upset and eat a lot when they are happy. 
I was just wondering if anyone can relate to this weird pattern of eating or what, if any, your emotional eating habits are? And if anyone can relate, how do you cope with it?
Thnx!"

0,"GF is overweight, and wants to lose weight. She's made progress before but is more recently very busy to focus on weight loss.. She's a very active girl, not just during her work but also due to her addiction with Scouts.  Initially when we met I was quite amazed she had put on some pounds considering all the activity she does, and having joined her for some of it, it ain't no joke.  I'm a healthy male perfect smack in the middle of the BMI scale, although sedentary, I was running out of breath before she was during some scout activities.  Goes to show I should be focusing on my own health too, not just worrying about hers.

She's active, smart and has already made progress before during her previous weight loss attempts.  I've promised to be of help but my dumb ass gets concerned every time she skips a meal or worries about being hungry and suggest her to nourish herself (bad habits I got passed on from my parents).  Whenever she probed me on the subject of her weight I've told her the truth - I love her the way she is, she's an angel in my eyes, but I do concern myself for her health, and I hold the belief that carrying extra weight around isn't healthy - she agrees and ain't a child, knows her situation well.  I've told her she's beautiful many times, but I don't think she believes me, even though I ain't lying, I think her weight affects her self esteem quite a bit.

The problem I reckon, stems from the fact her family cooks delicious food.  Back home we prepared meals made from haphazard ingredients stored incorrectly and then cooked to oblivion.  They taste... edible, as I spent my early life thinking that's all that food was.  Over at hers they're cooking the food for the gods themselves.  Even Zeus got a gut when he paid them a visit from another dimension.  Her mother is an amazing cook and a friendly, helpful person, but she's also severely obese (probably three times her daughter's size) and is already showing clear signs of mobility issues when she's not even through her 50s.

I'm confessing with you Reddit... I'm worried. I worry she'll end up in the same state as her mom.  If she does she won't be as active as she is now, she might even give up on most scout activities, she might want to stay inside.  Her self esteem would drop even further, wouldn't wanna keep going out.  I know she'll get bummed out, and I have no idea how to tell her any of this or help her without hurting her and insulting her mom.  Nevermind I'm perfectly ok telling the rest of the world on the internet... But when it comes to spoken words I'm too straightforward and a dumbass at keeping calm and not letting my excited ideas shoot out like bullets which get spat right back into my face.

If anything - what do you all reckon I should do?  Oh and I should mention, she may as well become a whale, I ain't leaving her.  That's never on the table.  I also don't wanna hurt her in any permanent way.  If I'm the one that pays a price that's no biggie, I just want her healthy and happy.  We're soon moving into our own house, I want her to be the mother of my children, I want her to love life, and I want her to be in love with herself even half as much as I am."

0,"I have a question. Here’s some things that I do that I wanna know if it’s normal or not. 
I’m in a wheelchair &amp; I ride around outside or in my room while listening to music with headphones &amp; I play out different unrealistic scenarios in my head &amp; it feels like it’s actually happening. For example, a scenario that I act out a lot is me singing a song (whatever song that fits how I feel or a deep meaningful song) that I pretend I wrote &amp; im “singing” in front of my entire college &amp; the person I’m thinking about while listening to music I pretend they’re in the audience &amp; I wrote the song about them. stuff like that. I’ll ride around for hours, playing out different scenarios. I grew up in a v abusive household so that’s what I’d do when they would be fighting. I’d pretend I’m somewhere else &amp; in the scenarios in my head, I’m not in a wheelchair. I can be/act out anything I want. I can be anywhere I wanna be. I’m not trapped. I don’t talk out loud, But sometimes I catch myself moving my mouth &amp; I’ll picture something funny or something funny would happen in the scenario &amp; I’d accidentally laugh bc I’m the funniest person I know lmao I’m sure besides my family, everyone else would think that’s so fuckin weird but it’s my coping mechanism tbh. 
I act out my dream scenarios that’ll never happen &amp; I’ll do it when I’m sad to get my mind off of it bc I can be anywhere or anyone I wanna be. In my head, my life is perfect. I look how I wish I looked. I have anyone I wanna have. I’ve done this my entire life &amp; im 20 &amp; I still do it. 
The best way i can think to describe it to where you might understand better: for example when you’re in the car as a kid &amp; you look out the window &amp; pretend you’re in a old R&amp;B music video 😂😭 that’s kinda how it is. 

It makes my crushes 100x worse bc in my head I’m playing out scenarios with them that makes me like them even more.

The case hinges on whether the loan should be treated as income received by Future Forward. 

It is standard accounting practice all over the world that a loan is not regarded as income — it's a debt that must be repaid. So if the Constitution Court judges were fair and honest, the party and its leaders would be cleared of any wrongdoing.

However, the judges are widely know to be neither fair nor honest — the Constitution Court has made rulings that are frequently absurd, and which benefit the monarchy and military at the expense of pro-democracy parties.

The Thai regime has launched a heavy-handed campaign to destroy Future Forward, and according to several high-level sources, this has been directly ordered by King Vajiralongkorn.

The king is paranoid about the party, and the growing tendency especially among younger Thais to stand up for democracy and human rights and openly criticise the military and monarchy, especially on social media. 

Future Forward wants to build a democratic Thailand while Vajiralongkorn wants to drag the country back into the past to the days of absolute monarchy. The king wants the party crushed, and its leaders jailed or driven out of politics. 

Vajiralongkorn's close ally Apirat Kongsompong, the fanatically royalist army chief who the king plans to instal as prime minister once he is eligible in a few years, also hates Future Forward, which has called for the military to stay out of politics and for conscription to be abolished. 

In October, Apirat made a hysterical speech that directly attacked Thanathorn and Future Forward. He claimed that leftist academics, communists, corrupt politicians and evil foreigners were conspiring to destroy Thailand using techniques of ""hybrid warfare"" such a propaganda, sedition, protests, and misinformation including fake news.

Apirat's obsession with a communist threat showed how stuck in the past he remains, and his conspiracy theory is absurd — clearly it is the palace and the Thai regime that use propaganda, brainwashing and fake news to try to hold on to power and undermine democracy.

But with Vajiralongkorn and Apirat both determined to destroy Future Forward, and the royalist elite obediently obeying their wishes, the party's future looks bleak.

So there is a strong possibility that the judges will declare that Future Forward breached the law. If they rule that the loan was income or a donation, breaching article 66 of the political party law which put a 10 million baht limit on donations, all the party's executive members will be banned from politics for five years, decapitating the Future Forward leadership. The loan funds will be confiscated.

If the judges also rule that the loan was income via an illegal channel, in breach of article 72 of the political party law, then the Future Forward Party will be dissolved.

Even if the party survives Friday's ruling, the regime's attempts to crush it will continue. Future Forward and Thanathorn still face 28 more outstanding cases against them. 

Thanathorn has already been disqualified from being an MP in the current parliament by the Constitutional Court for allegedly owning shares in a media company, even though he showed evidence he had sold the shares. Meanwhile, 55 other MPs who may have shares in media companies have not even been suspended from parliament, in a blatant display of double standards. 

The Election Commission and Constitutional Court routinely rule against pro-democracy parties like Future Forward, Pheu Thai, and Thai Raksa Chart which was dissolved before it could even compete in last year's election.

The Election Commission took no action against Prayut Chan-ocha's junta party Palang Pracharat over a lavish banquet at which it raised 650 million baht — including donations from state agencies such as the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the Tourism Authority of Thailand, which is not allowed under the political party law.

The reason Future Forward needed the loan from Thanathorn in the first place was because of ridiculous rulings by the Election Commission designed to undermine the party and give Palang Pracharat an unfair advantage. 

The Commission registered Future Forward as a party on October 3, 2018. On October 6, the party opened for membership and fundraising. But on October 10 the Commission said no donations were allowed, and on November 14 it told the party no fundraising was allowed. 

This made it impossible for the party to prepare properly for the elections, because it had been deliberately starved of funds. So Thanathorn stepped in with a loan.

It was only on December 11, 2018, that political activities were allowed by the junta, and the election law was only published on January 23, 2019, just two months before the election. So parties like Future Forward were placed at a huge disadvantage, and Palang Pracharat had a massive head start in the election.

It's almost certain that Future Forward will be dissolved, if not on Friday then sometime before the next election. Thanathorn may end up in jail — something he predicted himself when he launched his brave effort to bring genuine democracy to Thailand.

But what Vajiralongkorn and Apirat don't understand is that Future Forward is not just a party. It's a movement, supported by millions of Thais sick of corruption, coups, and the antics of the king, who rules Thailand from Germany and Switzerland and squanders vast amounts of taxpayers' money. 

Destroying Future Forward will further polarise Thailand and eventually the military and monarchy will be kicked out of politics. However hard they try, Vajiralongkorn and his allies can't keep the country stuck in the past forever."

Ive been super depressed since then. We got a search dog to come out and search for her 2 days later and it lead us to the lake across the street from our house with no other scent to track her with on the 12th my other lab shes a chocolate lab about 2 years old came home soaking wet looked like she came back from the lake and been looking in the water for her or playing but didn’t shake off. I’ve been depressed ever since and moody. shes my everything and i miss her terribly!! Last night i had the strangest real ass fucking dream most real dream i think i had ever!

In the dream i was crying and i really dont know where i was in the dream but, a lady appeared  quite older maybe 30’s 40’s since older people live in my neighborhood and she had long blonde hair or just long hair in general i couldn’t get a good look at her face but she brought my baby back and said she found her at a shelter and i woke up for a slight second and was holding my yorkie while sleeping but it felt like i was holding my baby lab but was picking him (my yorkie) up and holding him close in my sleep state, i went back into my dream somehow and i was just stunned holding her. I woke up crying and was looking around for her because the dream felt so REAL and thought she really came back.

I also haven’t been sleeping well either so that could be my problem but i went to bed early and i missed my school alarm and woke up at 8:30AM. i really don’t know what this dream means i read on some sites that  dreams are dreams and don’t mean anything and also read that if you have a dream so real like that it means it might happen. I really do hope it happens because we had my black lab fora little over 2 months now got her a little bit after new years day. I just know shes not dead and someone has her and i really want to know what this dream means.

0,"Dealing with Anxiety. I’m in need of some serious help. Until recently, I believed anxiety to be almost non existent. Fake, to me. I’ve always had the nervous feeling in my stomach from doing certain things, but up until recently that’s about it. 

After suffering from some health issues I’ve been told by doctors that a lot of my symptoms now, are being caused by anxiety. I’m not sure how much truth there is to this because it’s not the type of anxiety I’m used to. Sometimes I’m feeling normal and I succumb to a weird feeling in the upper region of my chest that goes into my lower throat. It doesn’t feel like acid reflux and I’m not sure if it’s a heart palpitation or something else. Other than that, I deal with an increased heart rate a lot of the time and just feeling of unease. I would say that while experiencing what doctors would call one of my “anxiety triggers” I do sometimes experience panic attacks. 

I would like to know what some of you think and what I should do for a next step? I’ve tried a little bit of meditating, but it doesn’t feel like it helps me that much. Should I consider taking anxiety medication because that worries me that I’ll be pill dependent. Or would therapy or something be more beneficial? 

Thanks to everyone who replies."
